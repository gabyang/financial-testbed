Note About Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding:
•the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
•our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, systems, facilities, and infrastructure, to continue to hire aggressively and provide competitive compensation programs, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions;
•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality, and macroeconomic conditions, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
•the potential for declines in our revenue growth rate and operating margin;
•our expectation that we will continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads we deliver and to reduce the number of accidental clicks;
•fluctuations in our revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members’ properties, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
•our expectation that our foreign exchange risk management program will not fully offset our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•the expected variability of costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
•our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues;
•our potential exposure in connection with pending investigations, proceedings, and other contingencies;
•our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins in the future;
•our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rates will fluctuate in the future;
•our expectation that our results will be affected by our performance in international markets as users in developing economies increasingly come online;
•our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues will continue to increase and may affect margins;
•our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely driven by market dynamics;
•estimates of our future compensation expenses;
•fluctuations in our effective tax rate;
•the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
•fluctuations in our capital expenditures;
•our expectations related to the operating structure implemented pursuant to the Alphabet holding company reorganization;
•the sufficiency and timing of our proposed remedies in response to the European Commission's (EC) decisions;
•the expected timing and amount of Alphabet Inc.'s share repurchases;
as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including without limitation, the following sections: Part I, Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended and as may be updated in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

Note 1.    Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google.
We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Noncontrolling interests are not presented separately as the amounts are not material. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2019, our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, and our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended, filed with the SEC.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debt allowance, sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We will adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. We are currently evaluating new credit loss models and updating our processes and controls in preparation for the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The effect on our consolidated financial statements will largely depend on the composition and credit quality of our investment portfolio and the economic conditions at the time of adoption.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) "Leases." Topic 842 supersedes the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, "Leases." Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. We adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. The most significant effects of Topic 842 were the recognition of $8.0 billion of operating lease assets and $8.4 billion of operating lease liabilities and the de-recognition of $1.5 billion of build-to-suit assets and liabilities. We applied Topic 842 to all leases as of January 1, 2019 with comparative periods continuing to be reported under Topic 840. In the adoption of Topic 842, we carried forward the assessment from Topic 840 of whether our contracts contain or are leases, the classification of our leases, and remaining lease terms. Our accounting for finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The standard does not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 for further details.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Performance fees have been reclassified for all periods from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net to align with the presentation of the investment gains and losses on which the performance fees are based. See Note 13 for further details.

Note 2.    Revenues

Debt Securities
We classify our marketable debt securities within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. The following tables summarize our debt securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 (in millions):

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $2 million and $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. We recognized gross realized losses of $41 million and $48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities with stated contractual maturity dates, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions, unaudited):

Losses on impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Equity Investments
The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method.
Marketable equity securities
Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.The following table summarizes marketable equity securities measured at fair value by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 (in millions):

(1) Includes an investment that was reclassified from non-marketable equity securities following the initial public offering of the issuer.
Non-marketable equity securities
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.The following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities (in millions, unaudited):

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, included in the $12.9 billion of non-marketable equity securities, $1.4 billion were measured at fair value based on observable market transactions, resulting in a net unrealized gain of $390 million.

Gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities
Gains and losses for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions, unaudited):
Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2019Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period$387 $42Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period(1)2,644 1,041Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net$3,031 $1,083
(1) Includes $2,488 million and $390 million related to non-marketable equity securities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. The cumulative net gain measured as the sale price less the initial purchase price for equity securities sold during the period ending March 31, 2019 was $118 million.
Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method
Equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as discussed below. Any components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged item.We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $327 million and $518 million, respectively, which was included in other current assets.
Cash Flow Hedges
We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.For forwards and option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. We reflect the gains or losses of a cash flow hedge included in our assessment of hedge effectiveness as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify these gains and losses to revenues when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions

become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net.As of March 31, 2019, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $113 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.0 billion as of both December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items.
Net Investment Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $6.7 billion and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively.Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts was $20.1 billion and $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively.The fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):

Note 4.    Leases
We have entered into operating and finance lease agreements primarily for data centers, land and offices throughout the world with lease periods expiring between 2019 and 2063. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2019. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in operating lease

17

Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.

liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with our lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed, however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.Components of operating lease expense were as follows (in millions, unaudited):

Note 5.    Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect their economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $2.4 billion and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $909 million and $786 million, respectively.
Calico
Calico is a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan.  In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico entered into a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In the second quarter of 2018, AbbVie and Calico amended the collaboration agreement resulting in an increase in total commitments. As of March 31, 2019, AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement and is committed to an additional $500 million which will be paid by the fourth quarter of 2019. As of March 31, 2019, Calico has contributed $500 million and has committed up to an additional $750 million.Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits for projects covered under this agreement equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico.As of March 31, 2019, we have contributed $480 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to fund up to an additional $750 million on an as-needed basis and subject to certain conditions.
Verily
Verily is a life science company with a mission to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. In December 2018, Verily received $900 million in cash from a $1.0 billion investment round. The remaining $100 million was received in the first quarter of 2019. As of March 31, 2019, Verily has received an aggregate amount of $1.8 billion from sales of equity securities to external investors. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions and no gain or loss was recognized.
Unconsolidated VIEs
Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the equity method are VIEs. These entities' activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these VIEs were $705 million and $665 million as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date. We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in them.
Other unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.

Note 6.    Debt
Short-Term Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.

Long-Term Debt
Google issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in three tranches (collectively, 2011 Notes) in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2014 Notes) in February 2014 due in 2024.In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024 (collectively, the Google Notes). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized. In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2016 Notes) due 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinate to the outstanding Google Notes. The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions):

We may redeem these notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was approximately $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Credit Facility
As of March 31, 2019, we have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities which expire in July 2023. The interest rate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.

Note 8.    Acquisitions
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we completed various acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $79 million. In aggregate, $39 million was attributed to intangible assets, $41 million was attributed to goodwill, and $1 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $15 million.Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.
For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 3.7 years and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.0 years.

Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results and ads, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and ads. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. While under appeal, the fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine.On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. We responded to the SO and the EC's informational requests. On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018. While under appeal, the fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search (AFS). We responded to the SO and to the EC's informational requests. On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AFS partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AFS agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. We plan to appeal the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. The fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Korean Fair Trade Commission have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In November 2016, we responded to the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. On February 8, 2018, the CCI issued its final decision, including a fine of approximately $21 million, finding no violation of competition law infringement on most of the issues it investigated, but finding violations, including in the display of the “flights unit” in search results, and a contractual provision in certain direct search intermediation agreements. We have appealed the CCI decision. The fine was accrued for in 2018.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to

24

Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.

change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for an en banc rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.
Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Non-Income Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

Note 11.    Stockholders' Equity
Share Repurchases
In January 2018, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $8.6 billion of its Class C capital stock, which was completed during the three months ended March 31, 2019. In January 2019, the

25

Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.

board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $12.5 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.7 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion.

As of March 31, 2019, there was $23.6 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
Performance Fees
We have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, performance fees of $632 million and $117 million, respectively, primarily related to gains on equity securities (for further information on gains on equity securities, see Note 3) were accrued and recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. Performance fees for prior periods have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net to conform with current period presentation. For further information see Note 1.

Note 14.    Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 was 10.8% and 18.3%, respectively. The increase is primarily due to a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the gains on equity securities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the non-deductible EC fine in the three months ended March 31, 2019.Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and partially offset by the impact from the EC fine that is not tax deductible.Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and the effects from a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the gains on equity securities.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
For information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 10.

Note 15.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.Our reported segments are:•Google – Google includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings.

Use of Monetization Metrics
Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads. Impressions for our Google Network Members' properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members' properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, and Google Ad Manager.Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks on our Google properties and the number of impressions on Google Network Members’ properties and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our Google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on Google Network Members’ properties.Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in advertising quality, formats or delivery;•changes in device mix;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•general economic conditions;•growth rates of revenues within Google properties;•seasonality; and•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.Our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels, changes in our product mix, changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery, increasing competition, query growth rates, our investments in new business strategies, shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues, and the evolution of the online advertising market. We also expect that our advertising revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues that are generated on:•Google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.; and•Other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube.Our Google properties revenues increased $3,684 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also experienced growth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising, as well as growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery. The growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to growth in YouTube engagement ads, and to a lesser extent, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. Cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Google Network Members' properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated from advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in:•AdMob;•AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.); and•Google Ad Manager.Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $394 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The growth was primarily driven by strength in both AdMob and programmatic advertising buying, partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.The impressions increased from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to growth in programmatic advertising buying. The cost-per-impression was relatively unchanged due to a combination of factors including ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

The growth was primarily driven by revenues from Google Cloud offerings as well as revenues from Google Play, largely relating to in-app purchases (revenues which we recognize net of payout to developers), partially offset by a decrease in hardware sales.Over time, our growth rate for Google other revenues may be affected by the seasonality associated with new product and service launches and market dynamics.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our international revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.The following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited):

Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. The cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members' properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’ properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:•Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and•Inventory related costs for hardware we sell. The following tables present our cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, unaudited):

(1) Revenues include hedging gains (losses) which affect TAC rates.Cost of revenues increased $2,545 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1,973 million and $572 million, respectively. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs and content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube, partially offset by a decrease in costs related to the decrease in hardware sales.The increase in total TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and TAC to Google Network Members. The decrease in the aggregate TAC rate was a result of the favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members' properties to Google properties and a decrease in the Network Members TAC rate.  The increase in TAC to distribution partners from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in Google properties revenues. The Google properties TAC rate was unchanged due to the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points, offset by an increase in YouTube advertising revenues where the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues.The increase in TAC to Google Network Members from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 was a result of an increase in Google Network Members' properties revenues offset by a decrease in the associated TAC rate. The decrease in the Network Members TAC rate from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to changes in product mix. Over time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Google Network Members TAC rates, which are affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix, product mix, revenue share terms, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies;•Google properties TAC rates, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and Google Network Members' properties;•Costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, Google Cloud, Search and YouTube and other products;•Content acquisition costs, which are affected by the relative growth rates in our YouTube advertising and subscription businesses; •Costs related to hardware sales; and•Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.

In addition, there was an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $186 million, largely resulting from a 20% increase in headcount.Over time, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues may be affected by discrete items.


European Commission Fine
In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) fine, which was accrued in the first quarter of 2019.

Other income (expense), net, decreased $1,372 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in unrealized gains on equity securities.Over time, other income (expense), net as a percentage of revenues may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable equity securities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant change in the value of our equity securities. Fluctuations in the value of these investments could contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.

Our provision for income taxes increased $347 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2019.

The increase is primarily due to a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the gains on equity securities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the non-deductible EC fine in the three months ended March 31, 2019.Our future effective tax rate may be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
As of March 31, 2019, we had $113.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

Note 1.    Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google.We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2018, our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, and our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 5, 2018.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable, sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value when observable price changes are identified or are impaired. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) "Leases." Topic 842 supersedes the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, "Leases." Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. As currently issued, entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. There are additional optional practical expedients that an entity may elect to apply. Based on our current portfolio of leases, approximately $8 billion of lease assets and liabilities would be recognized on our balance sheet, primarily relating to real estate. We are in the process of implementing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements. We will adopt Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019 and expect to elect certain available transitional practical expedients.In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We adopted ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for our marketable equity securities and the prospective method for our non-marketable equity securities. This resulted in a $98 million reclassification of net unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to opening retained earnings. We have elected to use the measurement alternative for our non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 increases the volatility of our other income (expense), net, as a result of the remeasurement of our equity securities. For further information on unrealized gains from equity securities, see Note 3. In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16 (ASU 2016-16) "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory." ASU 2016-16 generally accelerates the recognition of income tax consequences for asset transfers between entities under common control. We adopted ASU 2016-16 as of January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective transition method, resulting in a $701 million reclassification of unrecognized income tax effects related to asset transfers that occurred prior to adoption from other current and non-current assets to opening retained earnings.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

Note 2.    Revenues
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source (in millions, unaudited). Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.

Advertising Revenues
We generate revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google properties and Google Network Members’ properties.Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on Google.com, the Google Search app, and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube.Google Network Members’ properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on Google Network Members’ properties.Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through AdWords, DoubleClick AdExchange, and DoubleClick Bid Manager, among others.We offer advertising on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on an ad on Google properties or Google Network Members' properties or when a user views certain YouTube engagement ads. For these customers, we recognize revenue each time a user clicks on the ad or when a user views the ad for a specified period of time.We also offer advertising on other bases such as cost-per-impression, which means an advertiser pays us based on the number of times their ads are displayed on Google properties or Google Network Members’ properties. For these customers, we recognize revenue each time an ad is displayed.Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.For ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.

Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.

Other Revenues
Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from:•Apps, in-app purchases, and digital content in the Google Play store;•Google Cloud offerings;•Hardware; and•Other miscellaneous products and services.As it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a commission. Consequently, the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues.
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.
Deferred Revenues
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily driven by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $647 million of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2017.Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions
We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

Note 3.    Financial Instruments

Debt Securities
We classify our marketable debt securities within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. We reclassified our U.S. government notes included in marketable debt securities from Level 1 to Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as these securities are priced based on a combination of quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets and models with significant observable market inputs. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. The vast majority of our government bond holdings are highly liquid U.S. government notes.We classify our non-marketable debt securities as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they are primarily preferred stock and convertible notes issued by private companies without quoted market prices. To estimate the fair value of our non-marketable debt securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the fair value based on the best available information at the measurement date. The following tables summarize our debt securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 (in millions):

Equity Investments
Marketable equity securities
Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.Prior to January 1, 2018, we accounted for the majority of our marketable equity securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. Realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities sold or impaired were recognized in other income (expense), net.On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the way we account for marketable equity securities. Our marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and starting January 1, 2018 unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net. Upon adoption, we reclassified  $98 million net unrealized gains related to marketable equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to opening retained earnings.The following table summarizes marketable equity securities measured at fair value by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 (in millions):

Non-marketable equity securities
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values.Prior to January 1, 2018, we accounted for our non-marketable equity securities at cost less impairment. Realized gains and losses on non-marketable securities sold or impaired were recognized in other income (expense), net.  As of December 31, 2017, non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $4.5 billion and a fair value of approximately $8.8 billion. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the way we account for non-marketable securities. We now adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net. Because we adopted ASU 2016-01 prospectively, we will recognize unrealized gains that occurred in prior periods in the first period after January 1, 2018 when there is an observable transaction for our securities. Non-marketable equity securities remeasured during the three months ended March 31, 2018 are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.As of March 31, 2018, non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of approximately $7.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion was remeasured to fair value based on observable transactions during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2018 (in millions, unaudited):

Investments accounted for under the Equity Method
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. As a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 (ASU 2017-12) "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities," the components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged item beginning January 1, 2018.We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $15 million and $84 million, respectively.
Cash Flow Hedges
We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $11.7 billion and $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.For forwards and option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. We reflect the gains or losses of a cash flow hedge included in our hedge effective assessment as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify these gains and losses to revenues when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. As of March 31, 2018, the net gain or loss of our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was a net accumulated loss of $296 million, of which a net loss of $296 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively.Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts was $15.2 billion and $20.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively.The fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):

Note 4.    Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect their economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and statements of financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.  For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to us were $997 million and $906 million, respectively.

Calico
Calico is a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. As of March 31, 2018, we have contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis. In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. As of March 31, 2018, AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement, which reflects its total commitment. As of March 31, 2018, Calico has contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million.Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico.
Verily
Verily is a life science company with a mission to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. In 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, purchased a noncontrolling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. The transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized. Noncontrolling interest and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest were not separately presented on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as the amounts were not material.
Unconsolidated VIEs
Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the equity method are VIEs. These entities' activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these VIEs were $896 million and $877 million as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date. We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in them.Other unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.

Note 5.    Debt
Short-Term Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and $1.3 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.7% as of March 31, 2018. The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of March 31, 2018.
Long-Term Debt
Google issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in three tranches (collectively, 2011 Notes) in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2014 Notes) in February 2014 due in 2024.In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024 (collectively, the Google Notes). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized. In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2016 Notes) due 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinate to the outstanding Google Notes. The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions):

We may redeem these notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2018. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Credit Facility
We have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.

Note 7.    Acquisitions
Agreement with HTC Corporation (HTC)
In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of a team of engineers and a non-exclusive license of intellectual property from HTC for $1.1 billion in cash. In aggregate, $10 million was cash acquired, $165 million was attributed to intangible assets, $934 million was attributed to goodwill, and $9 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. Goodwill, which was included in Google, is not deductible for tax purposes. We expect this transaction to accelerate Google’s ongoing hardware efforts. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
Other Acquisitions
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $304 million. In aggregate, $2 million was cash acquired, $159 million was attributed to intangible assets, $147 million was attributed to goodwill, and $4 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $54 million.Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions, including HTC, have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the three months ended March 31, 2018, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 3.8 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 2.2 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.8 years.

Note 9.    Contingencies
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results and ads, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and ads. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.42 billion (approximately $2.74 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of approximately $2.74 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. The fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine.On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search. We responded to the SOs and continue to respond to the EC's informational requests. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcomes of these investigations; however, adverse decisions could result in fines and directives to alter or terminate certain conduct. Given the nature of these cases, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or ranges of loss, if any. We remain committed to working with the EC to resolve these matters.The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Korean Fair Trade Commission have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In November 2016, we responded to the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. On February 8, 2018, the CCI issued its final decision, including a fine of approximately $21 million that was accrued for in the current quarter, finding no violation of competition law infringement on most of the issues it investigated, but finding violations, including in the display of the “flights unit” in search results, and a contractual provision in certain direct search intermediation agreements. We have appealed the CCI decision.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. We continue to review our options. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.

Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Non-Income Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13.

Note 10.    Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchases
In October 2016, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, which was completed during the three months ended March 31, 2018. In January 2018, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $8.6 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.0 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $2.2 billion.

For the periods presented above, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.

Note 12.    Compensation Plans
Stock-Based Compensation
For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense was $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.
Stock-Based Award Activities

As of March 31, 2018, there was $20.0 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
Performance Fees
We have compensation arrangements with payouts based on investment returns. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, performance fees of $632 million primarily related to gains on equity securities (for further information, see Equity Investments in Note 3) were accrued and recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.

Note 13.    Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The Tax Act enacted in December 2017 introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain intercompany payments. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The adjustments made in the first quarter of 2018 were not significant. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed later in 2018.Our effective tax rate of 10.8% is lower than the 21% U.S. statutory rate due to the following: foreign income taxed at lower rates of 6.2%, income tax effects from a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily related to capital investments of 4.1%, U.S. general business credit of 2.3%, and other items of 0.2%, offset by additional unrecognized tax benefits of 2.6%.In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust the provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.We have received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend against any and all such claims as presented. While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters.For information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 9.

Note 14.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.Our reported segments are:•Google – Google includes our main products such as Ads, Android, Chrome, Commerce, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Hardware (including Nest), Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. •Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, Chronicle, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Access as well as licensing and R&D services through Verily. Revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented separately, as these amounts are immaterial. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information. In Q1 2018, Nest joined forces with Google’s hardware team. Consequently, the financial results of Nest have been reported in the Google segment, with Nest revenues reflected in Google other revenues. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation. Consolidated financial results are not affected.Information about segments during the periods presented were as follows (in millions, unaudited):

Use of Monetization Metrics
When assessing our advertising revenues performance, historically we presented the percentage change in the number of paid clicks and cost-per-click for both our Google properties and our Google Network Members’ properties (Network) revenues. As our impression-based revenues have become a more significant driver of Network revenues growth, the percentage change in paid clicks and cost-per-click cover less of our total Network revenues. As a result, in Q1 2018, we transitioned our Network revenue metrics from the percentage change in paid clicks and cost-per-click to the percentage change in impressions and cost-per-impression. Click-based revenues generated by our Network business are included in impression-based metrics, so that these metrics cover nearly all of our Network business. The monetization metrics for Google properties revenues remain unchanged.Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads. Impressions for our Google Network Members' properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members' properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, and DoubleClick AdExchange. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks on our Google properties and the number of impressions on Google Network Members’ properties and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our Google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on Google Network Members’ properties.Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•changes in device mix;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•general economic conditions;•growth rates of revenues within Google properties;•seasonality; and•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.Our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels, changes in our product mix, increasing competition, query growth rates, our investments in new business strategies, shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues, and the evolution of the online advertising market. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues that are generated on:•Google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.; and•Other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube.Our Google properties revenues increased $4,595 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also experienced growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery, as well as growth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising. Additionally, the growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to growth in YouTube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. Cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Google Network Members' properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated from advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in:•AdMob;•AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.); and•DoubleClick AdExchange.Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $636 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The growth was primarily driven by strength in both programmatic advertising buying and AdMob as well as the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. These increases were offset by a decline in our traditional AdSense businesses.The impressions from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018 were relatively unchanged, with growth in both AdMob and programmatic advertising buying offset by a decrease from our traditional AdSense for Content business due to changes in product mix resulting from ongoing product changes. The changes in cost-per-impression were primarily due to ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery and were also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our international revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.The following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited):

Our EMEA revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates, slightly offset by hedging losses. The foreign exchange effect was due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to certain currencies, including the Euro and British pound.Our revenues from APAC for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates, slightly offset by hedging losses. The foreign exchange effect was due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to certain currencies including the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, South Korean won, and Indian rupee.Our revenues from Other Americas for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates, slightly offset by hedging losses. The foreign exchange effect was due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, partially offset by the effect of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.

Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. The cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members' properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’ properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:•Amortization of certain intangible assets;•Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and•Inventory related costs for hardware we sell. The following tables present our cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, unaudited):

(1) Revenues include hedging gains (losses) which affect TAC rates.Cost of revenues increased $3,672 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was due to an increase in TAC of $1,659 million. The increase in TAC to distribution partners was a result of an increase in Google properties revenues and the associated TAC rate. The increase in TAC to Google Network Members was a result of an increase in Google Network Members' properties revenues and the associated TAC rate. The increase in the Google properties TAC rate was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The increase in the Network Members TAC rate was driven by the ongoing shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher TAC. The increase in the aggregate TAC rate was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members' properties to Google properties.Other cost of revenues increased $2,013 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was due to various factors, including an increase in data center and other operations costs, which include depreciation, compensation expenses (including SBC), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth and increased allocations primarily from general and administrative expenses; content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube; and hardware related costs.We expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•Google Network Members TAC rates, which are affected by the ongoing shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher TAC;•Google properties TAC rates, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•Growth rates of expenses associated with our data centers and other operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs;•Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, whose costs of revenues are generally higher in relation to our advertising revenues; and•Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and our Google Network Members' properties.

R&D expenses consist primarily of:•Compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services; and•Depreciation and equipment-related expenses.R&D expenses increased $1,097 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $751 million, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $287 million.We expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:•Advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and•Compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions.Sales and marketing expenses increased $960 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $429 million, largely resulting from increases in marketing and promotion-related expenses for our Cloud offerings and hardware products. In addition, there was an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $333 million, largely resulting from a 6% increase in headcount, and an increase in professional services fees of $115 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for outsourced services. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $615 million, largely resulting from accrued performance fees primarily related to gains on equity securities. The increase was offset by reduced allocations (with a corresponding net increase primarily in cost of revenues) and total legal settlement gain of $195 million.We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

Provision for Income Taxes
The following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate; unaudited):
Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018Provision for income taxes$1,393 $1,142Effective tax rate20.4% 10.8%
Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to gains on equity securities; and the Tax Act that became effective in 2018.Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
As of March 31, 2018, we had $102.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $10.2 billion, of which $890 million and $9.3 billion were presented within “income tax payable, current” and “income tax payable, non-current,” respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018. As permitted by the Tax Act, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018.Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of March 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2018, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion.In October 2016, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, which was completed during the three months ended March 31, 2018. In January 2018, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $8.6 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.0 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $2.2 billion.For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, our cash flows were as follows (in millions, unaudited):

Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google properties and Google Network Members' properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings.Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware inventory costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and Google other revenues (net of payouts to app developers) offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable and non-marketable securities, and payments for acquisitions.Net cash used in investing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in purchases of property and equipment, including the purchase of the Chelsea Market building, and increases in payments for acquisitions. These increases were offset by decreases in purchase of marketable securities and decreases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by or used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt.Net cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in repurchase of capital stock and increases in net payments related to stock-based award activities, offset by increases in net proceeds from the issuance of debt.

Contractual Obligations
We had short-term and long-term taxes payable of $10.2 billion as of March 31, 2018 related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act. For further information on the Tax Act, see Note 13. In addition, we had long-term taxes payable of $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2018 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
Impairment of Securities
We periodically review our debt securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. We also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.Our equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried at fair value or under the measurement alternative with changes recognized in net income upon the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date. We review impairment of those equity securities at each reporting period end when there are qualitative indicators that may reduce the carrying value. Once the qualitative indicators are identified and the fair value of the securities are less than carrying value, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.See Note 1 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, see Part I, Item 7, "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.


Note 2. Pioneer Natural Resources Merger
On May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer"), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The acquisition included over 850 thousand net acres in the Midland Basin of West Texas and proved reserves in excess of 2 billion oil-equivalent barrels. In connection with the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of ExxonMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion.The transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.


(billions of dollars)PioneerCurrent assets (1)3 Other non-current assets1 Property, plant & equipment (2)84 Total identifiable assets acquired88 Current liabilities (1)3 Long-term debt (3)5 Deferred income tax  liabilities (4)16 Other non-current liabilities2 Total liabilities assumed26 Net identifiable assets acquired62 Goodwill (5)1 Net assets (6)63 (1) Current assets and current liabilities consist primarily of accounts receivable and payable, with their respective fair values approximating historical values given their short-term duration, expectation of insignificant bad debt expense, and our credit rating.(2) Property, plant and equipment was preliminarily valued using the income approach. Significant inputs and assumptions used in the income approach included estimates for commodity prices, future oil and gas production profiles, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. Collectively, these inputs are Level 3 inputs.(3) Long-term debt was valued using market prices as of the acquisition date, which reflects the use of Level 1 inputs.(4) Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.(5) Goodwill was allocated to the Upstream segment.(6) Provisional fair value measurements were made for assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the date of acquisition, as we continue to evaluate the information necessary to complete the analysis.

The following table presents unaudited pro forma information for the Corporation as if the merger with Pioneer had occurred at the beginning of January 1, 2023:

The historical financial information was adjusted to give effect to the pro forma events that were directly attributable to the merger and factually supportable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated results reflect pro forma adjustments primarily related to conforming Pioneer's accounting policies to ExxonMobil, additional depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustment of the acquired property, plant and equipment, our capital structure, Pioneer's transaction-related costs, and applicable income tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments.Our transaction costs to effect the acquisition were immaterial.

Note 3. Litigation and Other Contingencies
Litigation
A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed.State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.Local governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.While the outcome of any litigation can be unpredictable, we believe the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. We will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.
Other Contingencies
The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2024, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Corporation had $675 million and $800 million of collateral under master netting arrangements not offset against the derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to initial margin requirements.The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of June 30, 2024, the Corporation has designated $3.2 billion of its Euro-denominated debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $237 million and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $1,795 million as of second quarter 2024.
Derivative Instruments
The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity, and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue" and in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in “Cash Flows from Operating Activities”. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, or results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting, and monitoring of derivative activity.
The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was as follows:

Note 9. Divestment Activities
Through June 30, 2024, the Corporation realized proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion and net after-tax earnings of $0.4 billion from its divestment activities. This included the sale of the Santa Ynez Unit and associated facilities in California, certain conventional and unconventional assets in the United States, as well as other smaller divestments.In 2023, the Corporation realized proceeds of approximately $4.1 billion and recognized net after-tax earnings of approximately $0.6 billion from its divestment activities. This included the sale of the Aera Energy joint venture, Esso Thailand Ltd., the Billings Refinery, certain unconventional assets in the United States, as well as other smaller divestments.In February 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Seplat Energy Offshore Limited for the sale of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited. The agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent and government approvals. In mid-2022, a Nigerian court issued an order to halt transition activities and enter into arbitration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In June 2024, the court order was lifted and arbitration suspended. The closing date and any loss on sale will depend on resolution of the conditions precedent and government approvals.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
Second quarter crude prices were essentially unchanged versus the first quarter, near the middle of the 10-year historical range (2010-2019), as the market remains relatively balanced. Natural gas prices declined due to lower demand from milder weather, though remained toward the middle of the 10-year range. Industry refining margins declined from the top of the 10-year range to the lower half of the range, as increased supply more than met record global demand in the second quarter. Chemical margins showed a slight improvement compared to the first quarter of 2024, although margins remained at bottom-of-cycle conditions and well below the 10-year range, as capacity additions outpaced demand growth.

Recent Mergers and Acquisitions
On May 3, 2024, ExxonMobil acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. See "Note 2. Pioneer Natural Resources Merger" of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Selected Earnings Factor Definitions
The updated earnings factors introduced in the first quarter 2024 provide additional visibility into drivers of our business results. The company evaluates these factors periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings factors:Advantaged Volume Growth. Earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, strategic projects, and high-value products. •Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects). Includes Permian (heritage Permian (1) and Pioneer), Guyana, Brazil, and LNG.•Strategic Projects. Includes (i) the following completed projects: Rotterdam Hydrocracker, Corpus Christi Chemical Complex, Baton Rouge Polypropylene, Beaumont Crude Expansion, Baytown Chemical Expansion, Permian Crude Venture, and the 2022 Baytown advanced recycling facility; and (ii) the following projects still to be completed: Fawley Hydrofiner, China Chemical Complex, Singapore Resid Upgrade, Strathcona Renewable Diesel, ProxximaTM Venture, USGC Reconfiguration, additional advanced recycling projects under evaluation worldwide, and additional projects in plan yet to be publicly announced. •High-Value Products. Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Lower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.Base Volume. Includes all volume/mix factors not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.Structural Cost Savings. After-tax earnings effect of Structural Cost Savings as defined on page 21, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the "volume/mix" factor.Expenses. Includes all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings factors.Timing Effects. Timing effects are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).

(1) Heritage Permian basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items
Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings (loss) excluding identified items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Structural Cost Savings
Structural Cost Savings describes decreases in cash opex excluding energy and production taxes as a result of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-savings measures that are expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $10.7 billion, which included an additional $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2024. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural Cost Savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation's efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.

REVIEW OF SECOND QUARTER 2024 RESULTS
ExxonMobil’s second quarter 2024 earnings were $9.2 billion, or $2.14 per share assuming dilution, compared with earnings of $7.9 billion a year earlier. The increase in earnings was mainly driven by improved realizations and increased volumes for advantaged Upstream investments in the Permian and Guyana, partially offset by weaker industry refining margins and higher scheduled maintenance. Capital and exploration expenditures were $7.0 billion, up $0.9 billion from second quarter 2023.Earnings for the first six months of 2024 were $17.5 billion, or $4.20 per diluted share, compared with $19.3 billion a year earlier. Capital and exploration expenditures were $12.9 billion, up $0.3 billion from the first six months of 2023. The Corporation distributed $8.1 billion in dividends to shareholders and repurchased $8.3 billion of common stock.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Growth and Other comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2024 was $11.5 billion, an increase of $0.8 billion from the comparable 2023 period primarily reflecting higher earnings. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $25.2 billion for the first six months of 2024, $0.5 billion lower than 2023. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $18.1 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $10.6 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $2.1 billion from 2023. Changes in operational working capital were a reduction of $2.6 billion during the period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $0.9 billion in 2024 versus a contribution of $1.1 billion in 2023. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details.Investing activities for the first six months of 2024 used net cash of $9.4 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $11.3 billion was $0.5 billion higher than 2023. Proceeds from asset sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion compared to the prior year. Net investments and advances decreased $0.1 billion from $0.7 billion in 2023. Cash acquired from mergers and acquistions during the first six months of 2024 was $0.8 billion.Net cash used in financing activities was $20.5 billion in the first six months of 2024, including $8.3 billion for the purchase of 72.1 million shares of ExxonMobil stock, as part of the previously announced buyback program, and $1.3 billion to repay Pioneer convertible debt. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $16.7 billion in the prior year. Total debt at the end of the second quarter of 2024 was $43.2 billion compared to $41.6 billion at year-end 2023. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 13.5 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2024 compared to 16.4 percent at year-end 2023. The net debt to capital ratio (1) was 5.7 percent at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 1.2 percentage points from year-end 2023. The Corporation's capital allocation priorities are investing in competitively advantaged, high-return projects; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and sharing our success with our shareholders through more consistent share repurchases and a growing dividend. The Corporation distributed a total of $8.1 billion to shareholders in the first six months of 2024 through dividends.The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $1.8 billion as of second quarter 2024.The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, cost synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

(1) Net debt is total debt of $43.2 billion less $26.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash . Net debt to capital ratio is net debt divided by net debt plus total equity of $276.3 billion. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the consolidated balance sheet.

Contractual Obligations
The Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. Through the second quarter of 2024, the Corporation entered into two long-term purchase agreements with an estimated total obligation of approximately $3.0 billion. The Corporation assumed take-or-pay obligations of $4.9 billion associated with the Pioneer acquisition that include long-term purchase, gathering, processing, and transportation commitments.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements related to future events; projections; descriptions of strategic, operating, and financial plans and objectives; statements of future ambitions and plans; and other statements of future events or conditions, are forward-looking statements. Similarly, discussion of roadmaps or future plans related to carbon capture, transportation and storage, biofuel, hydrogen, ammonia, direct air capture, and other future plans to reduce emissions and emission intensity of ExxonMobil, its affiliates, and third parties, are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress, policy support and timely rule-making and permitting, and represent forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including financial and operating performance; potential earnings, cash flow, dividends or shareholder returns, including the timing and amounts of share repurchases; total capital expenditures and mix, including allocations of capital to low carbon investments; realization and maintenance of structural cost reductions and efficiency gains, including the ability to offset inflationary pressure; plans to reduce future emissions and emissions intensity, including ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net zero from operated assets by 2050, to reach Scope 1 and 2 net zero in heritage Upstream Permian Basin (1) unconventional operated assets by 2030 and in Pioneer assets by 2035, to eliminate routine flaring in-line with World Bank Zero Routine Flaring, and to reach near-zero methane emissions from operated assets and other methane initiatives; meeting ExxonMobil’s divestment and start-up plans, and associated project plans as well as technology advances, including the timing and outcome of projects to capture, transport and store CO2, produce hydrogen and ammonia, produce biofuels, produce lithium, create new advanced carbon materials, and use plastic waste as a feedstock for advanced recycling; timely granting of governmental permits and certifications; future debt levels and credit ratings; business and project plans, timing, costs, capacities and profitability; resource recoveries and production rates; and planned Denbury and Pioneer integrated benefits could differ materially due to a number of factors. These include global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market factors, economic conditions, and seasonal fluctuations that impact prices and differentials for our products; changes in law, regulations, taxes, trade sanctions, or policies, such as the development or changes in government policies supporting lower carbon and new market investment opportunities such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the ability for projects to qualify for the financial incentives available thereunder, the punitive European taxes on the oil and gas sector and unequal support for different technological methods of emissions reduction or evolving, ambiguous and unharmonized standards imposed by various jurisdictions related to sustainability and GHG reporting; variable impacts of trading activities on our margins and results each quarter; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the outcome of commercial negotiations, including final agreed terms and conditions; the ability to access debt markets on favorable terms or at all; the occurrence, pace, rate of recovery and effects of public health crises, including the response from governments; reservoir performance, including variability and timing factors applicable to unconventional resources and the success of new unconventional technologies; the level and outcome of exploration projects and decisions to invest in future reserves; timely completion of development and other construction projects; final management approval of future projects and any changes in the scope, terms, costs or assumptions of such projects as approved; the actions of government or other actors against our core business activities and acquisitions, divestitures or financing opportunities; war, civil unrest, attacks against the company or industry, and other geopolitical or security disturbances, including disruption of land or sea transportation routes; expropriations, seizure, or capacity, insurance, shipping or export limitations imposed by governments or laws; opportunities for potential acquisitions, investments or divestments and satisfaction of applicable conditions to closing, including timely regulatory approvals; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to maintain near-term cost reductions as ongoing efficiencies; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties and unplanned maintenance; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs and the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; and other factors discussed under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of ExxonMobil’s 2023 Form 10-K.Forward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are material to investors or require disclosure in our filing with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental and other sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making.Actions needed to advance ExxonMobil’s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on ExxonMobil’s Global Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not  project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil’s business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by ExxonMobil or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Information about market risks for the six months ended June 30, 2024, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023.The impacts of price fluctuations on 2024 earnings have been revised to reflect the acquisition of Pioneer on an annualized basis. A $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $650 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $155 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical prices fluctuate in response to changing market forces. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.



ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.In the second quarter of 2024, ExxonMobil started the process of integrating Pioneer into its operations and internal control processes, resulting in some of Pioneer's historical internal controls being superseded by ExxonMobil's internal controls. This integration is expected to continue into 2025.

(XTO) received a Notice of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) against XTO regarding certain well pad production facility sites in Butler County, Pennsylvania. The letter did not quantify an associated civil penalty. The EPA alleged violations of certain federal New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Pennsylvania’s Title V operating permit regulations. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed a consent decree but a civil action has not been filed. In May 2024, the DOJ demanded a penalty of approximately $5.0 million. XTO is continuing to assess the factual basis of the allegations and proposed penalty and strongly disagrees with the DOJ’s position.As reported in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the State of Texas and the Corporation agreed to settle alleged violations of the Texas Clean Air Act at the Baytown Olefins Plant located in Baytown, Texas upon payment of $2.25 million to the State of Texas. Since then, the Travis County District Court for the State of Texas has approved and entered the settlement, and the Corporation has paid the agreed upon amounts in accordance with the terms therein.Refer to the relevant portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on legal proceedings.

EXXON MOBIL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.      Basis of Financial Statement PreparationThese unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein
reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a
normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to
conform to the current presentation basis.The Corporation's
exploration and production activities are accounted for under the
"successful efforts" method.2.     Recently Issued Accounting StandardIn
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2017. ExxonMobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements. 3.      Litigation and Other ContingenciesLitigationA variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including
updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at March 31,
2015, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the
Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase
commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to
be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition. The Corporation's outstanding unconditional
purchase obligations at March 31, 2015, were similar to those at the prior
year-end period. Unconditional purchase obligations as defined by accounting
standards are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable
only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure
financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. 
 
The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as
forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports;
price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of
property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the
Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.  
 
In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May
1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed
the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro
Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its
affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if
ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.
 
On September 6, 2007,
affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued
a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9,
2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the
ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of
expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded
annually until the date of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of
the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double
recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of an earlier award of $908
million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and
a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). 
 
Judgment was entered
on the ICSID award by the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York on October 10, 2014. The Republic of Venezuela filed a motion
to vacate that judgment on procedural grounds on October 14, 2014, and later, a
motion to modify the judgment by reducing the rate of interest to be paid on
the ICSID award from the entry of the court’s judgment, until the date of
payment. The court denied the Republic of Venezuela’s two motions on February
13, 2015, and March 4, 2015, respectively. The Republic of Venezuela filed a
notice of appeal of the court’s actions on the two motions on March 9, 2015.
 
On October 23, 2014,
the Republic of Venezuela filed with ICSID an application to revise the ICSID
award such that it requires repayment of the value of the ICC award to PdVSA at
the same time as payment is made to the ExxonMobil affiliates for the ICSID
award and that provision be made for interest on the amount to be repaid.
Thereafter, pursuant to ICSID arbitration rules, the ICSID award was stayed
pending further action of the Tribunal. On October 27, 2014, ExxonMobil filed a
response with ICSID that contests the application for revision of that award on
both factual and jurisdictional grounds. On February 2, 2015, the Republic of
Venezuela filed an application to annul the ICSID award. The application
alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award, the Tribunal exceeded its powers,
failed to state reasons on which the ICSID award was based, and departed from a
fundamental rule of procedure. Upon registration of this application with ICSID
on February 9, 2015, a further stay of the ICSID award was entered.
 
The federal court in
New York has stayed its judgment until such time as the stays of the ICSID
award entered following the Government of Venezuela’s filing of its two
applications have been lifted. The net impact of these matters on the
Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless,
the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon
the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

An
affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering
the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's
affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under
the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of
crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In
accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in
Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On
October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award
upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding
damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion
plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian
federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court
to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award.
The Contractors have appealed that judgment. In June 2013, the Contractors
filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to
preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if
necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. At
this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated
financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the
outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the
proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or
financial condition.

7.     Financial
InstrumentsThe fair value of
financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and
other valuation techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial
instruments where the difference between fair value and recorded book value is
notable is long-term debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding
capitalized lease obligations, was $19,735  million at March 31, 2015, and
$11,660  million at December 31, 2014, as compared to recorded book
values of $19,155  million at March 31, 2015, and $11,278  million at
December 31, 2014. The increase in the estimated fair value and book value
of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $8.0 billion of long-term
debt in the first quarter of 2015. The $8.0 billion of long-term debt is
comprised of $500 million of floating-rate notes due in 2018, $500 million of
floating-rate notes due in 2022, $1,600 million of 1.305% notes due in 2018,
$1,500 million of 1.912% notes due in 2020, $1,150 million of 2.397% notes due
in 2022, $1,750 million of 2.709% notes due in 2025, and $1,000 million of
3.567% notes due in 2045.The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at March 31, 2015, is: Level 1 $19,226 million;
Level 2 $446 million; and Level 3 $63 million. Level 1 represents
quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is
based upon a publicly available index. Level 3 involves using internal data
augmented by relevant market indicators if available.8.     Disclosures

REVIEW OF FIRST QUARTER 2015 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s first
quarter 2015 earnings of $4.9 billion, or $1.17 per diluted share, demonstrate
the value of the Company’s integrated businesses in a lower commodity price
environment. Regardless of current market conditions, the Company remains
focused on business fundamentals and competitive advantages that create long‑term
shareholder value.

Upstream earnings
were $2,855 million in the first three months of 2015, down $4,928 million
from the first quarter of 2014. Lower liquids and gas realizations decreased
earnings by $5.5 billion. Higher volumes and mix effects increased
earnings by $340 million, reflecting growth from new developments. All
other items, including favorable tax effects, increased earnings by
$250 million.On an oil‑equivalent
basis, production increased 2.3 percent from the first quarter of 2014.
Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 129,000 barrels
per day, while natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet per day,
down 188 million cubic feet per day from 2014. Project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline and maintenance
activities.The U.S. Upstream
operations recorded a loss of $52 million, down $1,296 million from
the first quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $2,907 million,
down $3,632 million from the prior year.

(1) Gas converted to oil-equivalent at 6 million cubic feet = 1

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net
Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of
net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price,
Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover
its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in
ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in
ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash provided by operating
activities totaled $8.0 billion for the first three months of 2015, $7.1
billion lower than 2014. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $5.1 billion, a decrease of $4.3 billion from the prior year
period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.3 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.1 billion. Changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2015, primarily due to
lower payables. Changes in operational working capital added $2.5 billion to
cash flow in 2014, primarily due to higher payables. All other items net
decreased cash by $0.9 billion in both periods. For additional details, see the
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 6. Investing activities
for the first three months of 2015 used net cash of $6.4 billion, an increase of
nearly $0.1 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to
property, plant and equipment of $6.8 billion was $0.5 billion lower than 2014.
Proceeds from asset sales of $0.5 billion decreased $0.6 billion. Additional
investment and advances decreased $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion. Other investing
activities – net decreased $0.1 billion to $0.3 billion.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2015 was $8.5 billion,
including asset sales of $0.5 billion, and decreased $7.7 billion from the
comparable 2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and working capital
changes.During the first
quarter of 2015, the Corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used
part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. Net cash used in financing
activities of $0.9 billion in the first three months of 2015 was $7.0 billion lower
than 2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of ExxonMobil stock in 2015.During the first
quarter of 2015, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 20 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.8 billion. These purchases included
$1 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding with the balance used to
acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares
outstanding decreased from 4,201 million at year-end to 4,181 million at the
end of the first quarter 2015. Purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.






17



The Corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $3.9
billion in the first quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.Total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015 compared to
$5.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014.Total debt of $32.8
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. The Corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 15.6 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.The Corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.The Corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s
common stock, or both.Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

2014. Income tax expense decreased by $4.3 billion to $1.6 billion reflecting
lower pre-tax income and a lower effective tax rate. The effective income tax
rate was 33 percent compared to 45 percent in the
prior year period due primarily to a lower share of earnings in higher
tax jurisdictions. Sales-based taxes and all other
taxes and duties decreased by $3.5 billion to $12.8 billion as a result of
lower sales realizations.

anticipates an average investment profile of about $34 billion per year for the
next few years. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions.In 2014,
the European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian
energy sector. ExxonMobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the Russian Federation.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2017. ExxonMobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors
Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in
Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2014 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.


Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Information about
market risks for the three months ended March 31, 2015, does not differ
materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for 2014.

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2015.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no
changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER
INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings

Regarding the
criminal charges filed against XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) by the Pennsylvania
Attorney General’s Office pertaining to XTO’s Marquardt Well Site in Penn
Township, Pennsylvania, reported most recently in the Corporation’s 2013 Form
10-K, in pre-trial proceedings on April 14, 2015, the Pennsylvania Court of
Common Pleas issued an order denying XTO’s motion to dismiss the case.With respect to the
enforcement action filed by the United States, on behalf of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the State of Arkansas, on behalf
of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, against ExxonMobil
Pipeline Company (EMPCo) related to the discharge of crude oil from the Pegasus
Pipeline in Mayflower, Faulkner County, Arkansas, previously reported in the
Corporation’s Forms 10-Q for the first, second, and third quarters of 2013, and
the first and second quarters of 2014, and in its 2014 Form 10-K, EMPCo
has reached an agreement with the United States and the State of Arkansas on a
Consent Decree to resolve the matter. The Consent Decree, if approved by the
court, would require EMPCo to pay a civil penalty to the United States of $3.19
million and to pay the State of Arkansas $1.88 million consisting of a $1
million civil penalty, $600,000 towards a supplemental environmental project,
and $280,000 to reimburse expenses of the Arkansas Attorney General’s Office.
In addition, the Consent Decree would require EMPCo to conduct enhanced
training, stage additional spill response equipment, and enhance integrity
treatment of the pipeline. The Consent Decree was lodged with the court on
April 22, 2015. A 30-day public comment period began on April 28, 2015, when
the Consent Decree was published in the Federal Register.As reported most
recently in the Corporation’s 2014 Form 10-K, in December 2014, XTO agreed to a
settlement with the Department of Justice, USEPA and the West Virginia
Department of Environmental Protections (WVDEP) concerning administrative
orders alleging Clean Water Act violations issued by the USEPA with regard to
eight XTO locations in West Virginia, five of which were voluntarily disclosed
by XTO to the USEPA. Pursuant to the settlement, XTO will pay a civil penalty
of $2.3 million and has entered into a Consent Decree with the Department of
Justice, USEPA and WVDEP. The Consent Decree requires XTO to prepare and submit
restoration plans for approval by USEPA and WVDEP and conduct approximately
$3.0 million in restoration and mitigation activities at the impacted locations
or at alternative locations approved by the USEPA and WVDEP. On April 24, 2015,
the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia
approved the Consent Decree.Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further
information on legal proceedings.

Note 1 - On August 1,
2000, the Corporation announced its intention to resume purchases of shares of
its common stock for the treasury both to offset shares issued in conjunction
with company benefit plans and programs and to gradually reduce the number of
shares outstanding. The announcement did not specify an amount or expiration date.
The Corporation has continued to purchase shares since this announcement and to
report purchased volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its most recent
earnings release dated April 30, 2015, the Corporation stated that second
quarter 2015 share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are anticipated to
equal $1 billion. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through
negotiated transactions, and purchases may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.

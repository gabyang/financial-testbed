EXXON MOBIL
CORPORATION
 
NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1.      Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
 
These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion
of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known
accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current
presentation basis.
 
The Corporation's exploration and
production activities are accounted for under the "successful
efforts" method.



2.     Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning
January 1, 2018. 
 
“Sales and other operating
revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the Corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings.  
 
The Corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard and its effect on the
Corporation’s financial statements. 
 
In February 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The
standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. The standard
is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019. ExxonMobil is evaluating
the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.



3.      Litigation and Other Contingencies
 
Litigation
 
A variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.



8



Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30,
2016, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities,
all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. The Corporation's
outstanding unconditional purchase obligations at June 30, 2016, were similar
to those at the prior year-end period. Unconditional purchase obligations as
defined by accounting standards are those long-term commitments that are
noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third
parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the
contracted goods or services. The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as
forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports;
price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of
property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the
Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.  In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May
1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed
the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro
Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its
affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if
ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.On September 6, 2007,
affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued
a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9,
2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the
ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of
expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded
annually until the date of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of
the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double
recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of an earlier award of $908
million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and
a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce. On June 12, 2015, the
Tribunal rejected in its entirety Venezuela’s October 23, 2014, application to
revise the ICSID award. The Tribunal also lifted the associated stay of
enforcement that had been entered upon the filing of the application to revise.
Still pending is
Venezuela’s February 2, 2015, application to ICSID seeking annulment of the
ICSID award. That application alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award, the
Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the ICSID award
was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. A separate stay
of the ICSID award was entered following the filing of the annulment
application. On July 7, 2015, the ICSID Committee considering the annulment
application heard arguments








9


from the parties on whether
to lift the stay of the award associated with that application. On July 28,
2015, the Committee issued an order that would lift the stay of enforcement
unless, within 30 days, Venezuela delivered a commitment to pay the award if
the application to annul is denied. On September 17, 2015, the Committee ruled
that Venezuela had complied with the requirement to submit a written commitment
to pay the award and so left the stay of enforcement in place. A hearing on
Venezuela’s application for annulment was held March 8-9, 2016.
 
The United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgment on the
ICSID award on October 10, 2014. Motions filed by Venezuela to vacate that
judgment on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by reducing the rate
of interest to be paid on the ICSID award from the entry of the court’s
judgment, until the date of payment, were denied on February 13, 2015, and
March 4, 2015, respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a notice of
appeal of the court’s actions on the two motions. Oral arguments on this appeal
were held before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
January 7, 2016.
 
The District Court’s
judgment on the ICSID award is currently stayed until such time as ICSID’s stay
of the award entered following Venezuela’s filing of its application to annul
has been lifted. The net impact of these matters on the Corporation’s
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the
Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the
Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
 
An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors
under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of
Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25
percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC
regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the
terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors
initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal
issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects
and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately
$1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned
a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the
same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the
award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja
Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of
the lower court setting aside the award. ExxonMobil expects that the
Contractors will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013,
the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court
in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts
if necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC
has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Proceedings in the Southern District of New
York are currently stayed. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the
Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation
does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
Corporation's operations or financial condition.

7.     Financial
Instruments
 
The fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $29,547 million at June 30, 2016, and $18,854 million at
December 31, 2015, as compared to recorded book values of $28,247 million
at June 30, 2016, and $18,687 million at December 31, 2015. The increase
in the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the
Corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter
of 2016. The $12.0 billion of long‑term debt is comprised of $750 million
of floating-rate notes due in 2018, $250 million of floating-rate notes due in
2019, $1,000 million of 1.439% notes due in 2018, $1,250 million of 1.708%
notes due in 2019, $2,500 million of 2.222% notes due in 2021, $1,250 million
of 2.726% notes due in 2023, $2,500 million of 3.043% notes due in 2026 and
$2,500 million of 4.114% notes due in 2046.
 
The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at June 30, 2016, is: Level 1 $29,366 million;
Level 2 $119 million; and Level 3 $62 million. Level 1 represents
quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is
based upon a publicly available index. Level 3 involves using internal data
augmented by relevant market indicators if available.

References in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil
(U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement. Unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and
Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW
OF SECOND QUARTER 2016 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s
second quarter 2016 earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.41 per diluted
share, compared with $4.2 billion a year earlier. The results reflect
sharply lower commodity prices, weaker refining margins and continued strength
in the Chemical segment.While
our financial results reflect a volatile industry environment, ExxonMobil
remains focused on business fundamentals, cost discipline and advancing
selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive
advantage. The corporation benefits from scale and integration, which provide
the financial flexibility to invest in attractive opportunities and grow
long-term shareholder value.Earnings
in the first six months of 2016 were $3.5 billion, down $5.6 billion, or 62
percent, from 2015.Earnings
per share assuming dilution were $0.84.Capital
and exploration expenditures were $10.3 billion, down 36 percent from 2015.Oil-equivalent
production was unchanged at 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, with
liquids up 6.6 percent and natural gas down 6.7 percent.The
corporation distributed $6.2 billion in dividends to shareholders.

Upstream earnings
were $294 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $1,737 million
from the second quarter of 2015. Lower liquids and gas realizations decreased
earnings by $2.2 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings
by $50 million. All other items, including lower expenses, the absence of
a one-time deferred income tax impact related to the tax rate increase in
Alberta, Canada, and favorable foreign exchange effects increased earnings by
$450 million.On an oil‑equivalent basis,
production was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2015. Liquids
production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 39,000 barrels per
day. Project ramp‑up was partly offset by field decline and downtime
mainly in Canada and Nigeria. Natural gas production was 9.8 billion cubic
feet per day, down 366 million cubic feet per day from 2015 including
field decline and divestment impacts.U.S. Upstream earnings declined
$467 million from the second quarter of 2015 to a loss of
$514 million in the second quarter of 2016. Non‑U.S. Upstream earnings
were $808 million, down $1,270 million from the prior year.Upstream earnings were $218 million,
down $4,668 million from the first half of 2015. Lower realizations
decreased earnings by $4.9 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $20 million. All other items increased earnings by
$180 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence
of asset management gains.On an oil‑equivalent basis,
production of 4.1 million barrels per day was flat compared to the first
half of 2015. Liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day increased
150,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up partly offset by field
decline and downtime mainly from the Canadian wildfires. Natural gas production
of 10.2 billion cubic feet per day decreased 730 million cubic feet
per day from 2015 largely due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands,
field decline and divestment impacts.U.S. Upstream earnings declined
$1,247 million from 2015 to a loss of $1,346 million in 2016. Earnings
outside the U.S. were $1,564 million, down $3,421 million from the
prior year.

(1) Gas converted to oil-equivalent at 6 million cubic feet = 1

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net
Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of
net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price,
Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover
its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in
ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in
ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million. All
other items increased earnings by $40 million, including lower maintenance
expenses partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Petroleum
product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 237,000 barrels per
day lower than the prior year due in part to asset management activity. Earnings
from the U.S. Downstream were $412 million, flat with the second quarter
of 2015. Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings of $413 million were
$681 million lower than last year. Downstream
earnings of $1,731 million for the first six months of 2016 decreased $1,442 million
from 2015. Weaker refining margins decreased earnings by $1.7 billion,
while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million. All other
items increased earnings by $130 million, mainly reflecting lower
maintenance expense. Petroleum product sales of 5.4 million barrels per
day were 358,000 barrels per day lower than 2015 due in part to asset
management activity.U.S.
Downstream earnings were $599 million, a decrease of $380 million from
2015. Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,132 million, down
$1,062 million from the prior year.

$1,090 million, down $250 million from the first half 2015 reflecting
the absence of asset management gains. Non‑U.S. Chemical earnings of
$1,482 million were $594 million higher than last year.

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2016 was $5.5 billion,
including asset sales of $1 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.Cash provided by
operating activities totaled $9.3 billion for the first six months of 2016,
$7.5 billion lower than 2015. The major source of funds was net income
including noncontrolling interests of $3.5 billion, a decrease of $5.9 billion
from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $9.6
billion for depreciation and depletion increased by $0.8 billion. Changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2016 and
$1.5 billion in 2015. All other items net decreased cash by $2.0 billion in
2016 and increased cash by $0.2 billion in 2015. For additional details, see
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 6. Investing activities
for the first six months of 2016 used net cash of $7.5 billion, a decrease of
$5.3 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $8.9 billion was $5.1 billion lower than 2015. Proceeds
from asset sales of $1.2 billion increased $0.1 billion. Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2016 was $10.5 billion,
including asset sales of $1.2 billion, and decreased $7.4 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.During the first
quarter of 2016, the Corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. Net cash used by financing
activities was $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2016, $2.8 billion lower
than 2015 reflecting the 2016 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of ExxonMobil stock in 2016.During the first six
months of 2016, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. These purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. Shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the second quarter 2016. Purchases may be made in both
the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

The Corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $3.1 billion in the second quarter of
2016 through dividends. Total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2016 was the
same as at the end of the second quarter of 2015.Total debt of $44.5
billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end 2015. The Corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 20.1 percent at the end of the second quarter of
2016 compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.The Corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.The Corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $13.4 billion for the second
quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.8 billion from 2015. Income tax expense
decreased by $2.0 billion to $0.7 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The
effective income tax rate was 40 percent compared to 45 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by
$0.8 billion to $12.7 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $24.9 billion for the first
six months of 2016, a decrease of $5.7 billion from 2015. Income tax expense
decreased by $3.6 billion to $0.7 billion as a result of lower earnings and a
lower effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate was 31 percent compared
to 39 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in
lower tax jurisdictions. Sales-based and all
other taxes decreased by $2.1 billion to $24.3 billion
as a result of lower sales realizations.In
the United States, the Corporation has various U.S. federal income tax
positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years
2006-2011. The IRS has asserted penalties for all years associated with
several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the
penalties as an expense because, in the Corporation’s judgment, the IRS should
not be able to sustain the penalty under applicable law. Unfavorable
resolution of these issues would not have a materially adverse effect on the
Corporation’s net income or liquidity. The IRS has not completed its audit
of tax years after 2011.

Capital and
exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2016
were $5.2 billion, down 38 percent from the second quarter of 2015. Capital and exploration expenditures in the first six months of
2016 were $10.3 billion, down 36 percent from the first six months of 2015 due
primarily to lower major project spending. Given recent efficiencies, market
capture, and project selectivity, the Corporation anticipates a 2016 investment
level below the $23.2 billion target that was referenced last quarter. Actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions.In 2014,
the European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian
energy sector. ExxonMobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the Russian Federation.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning
January 1, 2018. “Sales and other operating revenue” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes
on sales transactions. When the Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will
exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. This change in
reporting will not impact earnings.The Corporation continues to evaluate
other areas of the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial
statements. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted
beginning January 1, 2019. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the Corporation’s financial statements.




FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource
recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of
economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts;
changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental
requirements; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; changes in technical
or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our
website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K. We assume no duty
to update these statements as of any future date.  The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.


Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Information about
market risks for the six months ended June 30, 2016, does not differ materially
from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form
10-K for 2015.

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no
changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER
INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings

As last reported in
the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, in a matter related
to the discharge of crude oil from the Pegasus Pipeline in Mayflower, Faulkner
County, Arkansas, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(PHMSA) on October 1, 2015, issued a Final Order arising from a November 2013
Notice of Probable Violation alleging that ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (EMPCo)
violated multiple federal Pipeline Safety Regulations. The Final Order imposed
a penalty of $2,630,400, which EMPCo paid on April 21, 2016. On June 27, 2016,
EMPCo filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
contesting PHMSA’s regulatory findings and compliance order directives and
seeking a refund of the penalty paid.As reported in the
Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, in the civil action
filed by the Illinois Attorney General and Will County State’s Attorney
relating to an October 18, 2012, release of oil mist from a pressure relief
valve associated with the coker unit at ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s (EMOC)
Joliet Refinery, the parties agreed to resolve and settle all remaining issues.
The final consent order was approved and entered by the Will County Court on
May 4, 2016, and EMOC has paid the $300,000 penalty and reimbursed $26,000 to
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for expenses incurred. Additionally,
EMOC is required to complete a coker unit project by December 31, 2018.As last reported in
the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, on April 1, 2016,
EMOC and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) of California
agreed to settle all alleged violations resulting from a rapid overpressure
that occurred at the Torrance Refinery’s electrostatic precipitators on
February 18, 2015, which resulted in a release of catalyst dust into the air,
as well as alleged violations resulting from the subsequent start-up of the fluid
catalytic cracking unit. EMOC paid $4,712,500 ($2,356,250 in civil penalties
and $2,356,250 to a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) fund set up by the
SCAQMD) on April 13, 2016. Additionally, EMOC paid a penalty of $830,000 on
June 20, 2016 (at the previously agreed-upon rate, and equally split between
civil penalties and the SEP fund) related to the start-up process.Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information
on legal proceedings.

(See Note 1)

During the second
quarter, the Corporation did not purchase any shares of its common stock for
the treasury.Note 1 - On August 1,
2000, the Corporation announced its intention to resume purchases of shares of
its common stock for the treasury both to offset shares issued in conjunction
with company benefit plans and programs and to gradually reduce the number of
shares outstanding. The announcement did not specify an amount or expiration
date. The Corporation has continued to purchase shares since this announcement
and to report purchased volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its
earnings release dated February 2, 2016, the Corporation stated it will
continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with benefit plans
and programs, but had suspended making purchases to reduce shares outstanding
effective beginning the first quarter of 2016.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis.The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.



Note 2. Russia
In response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced in early 2022 that it plans to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. In light of this, an impairment assessment was conducted, and management determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Corporation’s first quarter earnings included after-tax charges of $3.4 billion largely representing the impairment of its operations related to Sakhalin. On a before-tax basis, the charges amounted to $4.6 billion, substantially all of which is reflected in the line captioned “Depreciation and depletion (including impairments)” on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation's exit from the project would result in quantities estimated at 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves, which represented less than one percent of the Corporation's 18.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved reserves at year-end 2021.

Note 3. Litigation and Other Contingencies
Litigation
A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
Other Contingencies
The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2022, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights; sanctions and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, the Corporation had $1,403 million and $641 million of collateral under master netting arrangements not offset against the derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to initial margin requirements.The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of June 30, 2022, the

Corporation has designated $4.7 billion of its Euro-denominated long-term debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $10.6 billion, of which $10 billion will expire without renewal in the third quarter, and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $0.4 billion as of second quarter 2022.
Derivative Instruments
The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of our business segments reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue". The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, or results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was as follows:

Note 9. Divestment Activities
In February 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Seplat Energy Offshore Limited for the sale of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited. The agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent and government approvals. In early July, a Nigerian court issued an order to halt transition activities and enter into arbitration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. The closing date and any loss on sale will depend on resolution of these matters.In May 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement for the sale of ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Romania, consisting of certain unproved Upstream assets, to Romgaz S.A. The transaction closed in the third quarter, and the Corporation will recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $300 million. In June 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Whitecap Resources Inc. for the sale of XTO Energy Canada, consisting of Upstream unconventional assets in central Alberta. The agreed sales price is subject to interim period adjustments from May 1, 2022 to the closing date. The transaction is anticipated to close in the third quarter, and the Corporation expects to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $300 million.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During the COVID-19 pandemic, industry investment to maintain and increase production capacity was restrained to preserve capital, resulting in underinvestment and supply tightness as demand for petroleum and petrochemical products recovered. In addition, industry rationalization of refining capacity resulted in more than 3 million barrels per day of capacity being taken offline. Across late 2021 and the first half of 2022, this dynamic, along with supply chain constraints, and a continuation of demand recovery led to a steady increase in oil and natural gas prices and refining margins. In the first half of 2022, tightness in the oil and natural gas markets was further exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions imposed upon business and other activities in Russia. The price of Brent crude oil and certain regional natural gas indicators increased to levels not seen for several years, and both natural gas realizations and industry refining margins improved to levels well above the 10-year range. By the end of the second quarter, high prices had led to a tempering of demand for some products. Commodity and product prices are expected to remain volatile given the current global economic uncertainty and geopolitical events affecting supply and demand.In response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced in early 2022 that it plans to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. The Corporation remains focused on protecting the safety of employees, operations, and the environment. The Corporation is complying with all applicable laws and sanctions and is currently engaged in transitioning Sakhalin-1 operating activities to another party.The Corporation’s first quarter results included after-tax charges of $3.4 billion largely representing the impairment of its operations related to Sakhalin (see Note 2 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Efforts to transition operatorship to a third party and exit the venture are expected to result in minimal hydrocarbon sales and cash flows for the Corporation’s account in future periods. For reference, excluding the impact of impairments and other charges, after-tax earnings related to the Corporation’s interest in Sakhalin during the first half of 2022 were approximately $0.3 billion, and combined oil and gas production was approximately 45 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day. The Corporation's exit from the project would result in quantities estimated at 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves, which represented less than one percent of the Corporation's 18.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved reserves at year-end 2021.The Corporation holds a 25% interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and holds a 16.8% working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline, in which the Corporation holds a 7.5% interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event that existing sanctions related to Russia’s military actions in Ukraine expand, new sanctions are imposed, countermeasures are employed by the Russian Federation, or other direct or indirect impacts arise, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration. For reference, after-tax earnings related to the Corporation’s interests in Kazakhstan for the first half of 2022 were $1.5 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 250 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.Effective April 1, 2022, the Corporation streamlined its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses into a single business, Product Solutions. The new business is focused on growing high-value products, improving competitiveness and leading in sustainability. Product Solutions consists of three operating segments:•Energy Products: Fuels, aromatics, and catalysts and licensing•Chemical Products: Olefins, polyethylene, polypropylene, and intermediates•Specialty Products: Finished lubricants, basestocks and waxes, synthetics, and elastomers and resinsFurther information on financial performance related to the new segments are disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

FUNCTIONAL EARNINGS SUMMARY
Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items, are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of temporary non-operational production limits or sanctions imposed by governments, generally upon a country, sector, type or method of production. Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Other comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Total taxes were $14.1 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $4.2 billion from 2021. Income tax expense was $6.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year reflecting higher commodity prices. The effective income tax rate of 31 percent compared to 30 percent in the prior year period. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $0.7 billion to $7.8 billion.Total taxes were $25.4 billion for the first six months of 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion from 2021. Income tax expense increased by $6.8 billion to $9.2 billion reflecting higher commodity prices. The effective income tax rate of 34 percent compared to 31 percent in the prior year period primarily due to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and the impact of one-time items. Total other taxes and duties increased by $0.5 billion to $16.2 billion.In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The Corporation filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in U.S. federal district court (District Court) with respect to the positions at issue for those years. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation received an adverse ruling on this suit. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. On January 13, 2021, the District Court ruled that no penalties apply to the Corporation's positions in this suit. The Corporation and the government have appealed the District Court's rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit). Proceedings in the Fifth Circuit are continuing. On March 4, 2022, the Corporation also filed a refund suit for tax years 2010-2011 in District Court with respect to the positions at issue for those years. The Corporation has not recognized asserted penalties for 2010-2011 as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

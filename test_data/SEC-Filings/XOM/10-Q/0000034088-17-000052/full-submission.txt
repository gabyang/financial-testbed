EXXON
MOBIL CORPORATION
 
NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1.      Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
 
These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion
of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known
accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current
presentation basis.
 
The Corporation's exploration and
production activities are accounted for under the "successful
efforts" method.
 
2.      Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new
standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard
establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with
customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands disclosure
requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018.
“Sales and Other Operating Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income
includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the
Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes
collected on behalf of third parties. This change in reporting will not impact
earnings. The Corporation expects to adopt the standard using the Modified
Retrospective method, under which prior years’ results are not restated, but
supplemental information on the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018
results. The Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard,
which are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial
statements.
 
In January 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued an updated standard, Financial
Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard requires investments
in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value
recognized through net income. Companies can elect a modified approach for
equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. ExxonMobil
is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2018. 
 
In March 2017, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update, Compensation –
Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic
Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The update
requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the
same line of the income statement as other compensation costs and the other
components of net benefit costs (non-service costs) to be presented separately
from the service cost component. Additionally, only the service cost component
of net benefit costs will be eligible for capitalization. The update is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. The Corporation expects to
add a new line “Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense” to its
Consolidated Statement of Income. This line would reflect the non-service costs
that were previously included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and
“Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The update is not expected to
have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial statements. Beginning
January 1, 2018, the Corporation expects to include all of the
non-service costs in its Corporate and financing segment.
 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard
and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it
in 2019.

3.      Litigation and Other ContingenciesLitigationA variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at
September 30, 2017, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and
other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect
management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are
not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities,
all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying
degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced
divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price
controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property;
cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the
likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation
vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable. In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May
1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed
the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro
Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its
affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if
ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.

On September 6, 2007,
affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued
a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9,
2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the
ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of
expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded
annually until the date of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of
the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double
recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of an earlier award of $908
million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and
a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce.
 
On February 2, 2015,
Venezuela filed a Request for Annulment of the ICSID award. On March 9, 2017,
the ICSID Committee hearing the Request for Annulment issued a decision
partially annulling the award of the Tribunal issued on October 9, 2014. The
Committee affirmed the compensation due for the La Ceiba project and for export
curtailments at the Cerro Negro project, but annulled the portion of the award
relating to the Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) based on its
determination that the prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap
on damages in the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount
owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro project. As a result, ExxonMobil
retains an award for $260 million (including accrued interest). ExxonMobil
reached an agreement with Venezuela for full payment of the $260 million
and Venezuela has begun performing on it. The agreement does not impact
ExxonMobil’s ability to re-arbitrate the issue that was the basis for the
annulment in a new ICSID arbitration proceeding.
 
The United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgment on the ICSID
award on October 10, 2014. Motions filed by Venezuela to vacate that judgment
on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by reducing the rate of
interest to be paid on the ICSID award from the entry of the court’s judgment,
until the date of payment, were denied on February 13, 2015, and March 4,
2015, respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a notice of appeal of the
court’s actions on the two motions. On July 11, 2017, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit rendered its opinion overturning the District
Court’s decision and vacating the judgment on the grounds that a different
procedure should have been used to reduce the award to judgment. The
Corporation is evaluating next steps.
 
A stay of the District
Court’s judgment has continued pending the completion of the Second Circuit
appeal. The net impact of these matters on the Corporation’s consolidated
financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation
does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition.
 
An affiliate
of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract
(PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha
block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the
operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The
Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in
excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the
terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria,
under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011,
a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors'
position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors
jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued
interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement
of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside.
On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that
judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the
Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award.
On
October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of
Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability
to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal
by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June
2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC
has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. The stay in the proceedings in the Southern
District of New York has been lifted. At this time, the net impact of this
matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably
estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the
Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
Corporation's operations or financial condition.

7.     Financial
InstrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $24,199 million at September 30, 2017, and
$27,968 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to recorded book
values of $23,523 million at September 30, 2017, and $27,707 million
at December 31, 2016. The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at September 30, 2017, is: Level 1 $24,021 million;
Level 2 $172 million; and Level 3 $6 million. Level 1 represents
quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is
based upon a publicly available index. Level 3 involves using internal data
augmented by relevant market indicators if available.8.     Disclosures

9.     InterOil Corporation and Permian
Basin Properties AcquisitionsInterOil CorporationOn February 22, 2017,
the Corporation completed the acquisition of InterOil Corporation (IOC) for
$2.7 billion. The IOC acquisition was unproved properties in Papua New Guinea.
Consideration included 28 million shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common
stock having a value on the acquisition date of $2.2 billion, a Contingent
Resource Payment (CRP) with a fair value of $0.3 billion and cash of $0.2
billion. The CRP provides IOC shareholders $7.07 per share in cash for each
incremental independently certified Trillion Cubic Feet Equivalent (TCFE) of
resources above 6.2 TCFE, up to 11.0 TCFE. IOC’s assets include a contingent receivable
related to the same resource base for volumes in excess of 3.5 TCFE at amounts
ranging from $0.24 - $0.40 per thousand cubic feet equivalent. The fair value
of the contingent receivable was $1.1 billion at the acquisition date. Fair
values of contingent amounts were based on assumptions about the outcome of the
resource certification, future business plans and appropriate discount rates. On September 6, 2017,
the resource certification was finalized triggering both payment of the CRP to
former IOC shareholders and receipt of the current portion of the contingent
receivable. The earnings impact from settlement of the CRP and the related
contingent receivable was not material.Permian Basin
PropertiesOn February 28, 2017,
the Corporation completed the acquisition for $6.2 billion of a number of companies
from the Bass family in Fort Worth, Texas, that indirectly own mostly unproved
oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin and other assets. Consideration
included 68 million shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock having a value
on the acquisition date of $5.5 billion, together with additional contingent
cash payments tied to future drilling and completion activities (up to a
maximum of $1.02 billion). The fair value of the contingent payment was $0.7
billion as of the acquisition date and is expected to be paid beginning in 2020
and ending no later than 2032 commensurate with the development of the
resource. Fair value of the contingent payment was based on assumptions
including drilling and completion activities, appropriate discount rates and
tax rates.Below is a summary of
the net assets acquired for each acquisition.

REVIEW
OF THIRD QUARTER 2017 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s
third quarter 2017 earnings of $4 billion, or $0.93 per diluted share,
compared with $2.7 billion a year earlier, as commodity prices improved
and performance in the Upstream and Downstream strengthened.Earnings
of $11.3 billion for the first nine months of 2017 increased 84 percent
from $6.2 billion in 2016.Earnings
per share assuming dilution were $2.66.Capital
and exploration expenditures were $14.1 billion, down 3 percent from
2016.Oil‑equivalent
production was 4 million barrels per day, down 1 percent from the
prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil‑equivalent
production was up 1 percent from the prior year.The
Corporation distributed $9.7 billion in dividends to shareholders.

earnings were $1,567 million in the third quarter of 2017, up $947 million
from the third quarter of 2016. Higher liquids and gas realizations increased
earnings by $860 million. Higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$20 million. All other items increased earnings by $70 million as lower
expenses were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.On
an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 2 percent from the third
quarter of 2016. Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day,
up 69,000 barrels per day as lower downtime and higher project volumes
were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was 9.6 billion
cubic feet per day, down 16 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as field
decline and lower demand were partly offset by project ramp‑up, primarily
in Australia, and work programs.U.S.
Upstream results were a loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017,
compared to a loss of $477 million in the third quarter of 2016. Non‑U.S.
Upstream earnings were $1,805 million, up $708 million from the prior year.Upstream
earnings were $5,003 million in the first nine months of 2017, up
$4,165 million from 2016. Higher realizations increased earnings by
$4.1 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by
$300 million. All other items increased earnings by $380 million,
primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable tax items in the
current year.On
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was
down 1 percent compared to 2016. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels
per day decreased 65,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower
entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs.
Natural gas production of 10.1 billion cubic feet per day increased 106 million
cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up, primarily in Australia,
was partly offset by field decline.U.S.
Upstream results were a loss of $439 million in 2017, compared to a loss
of $1,823 million in 2016. Non‑U.S. Upstream earnings were
$5,442 million, up $2,781 million from the prior year.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.Entitlements - Net
Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of
net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price,
Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover
its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in
ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in
ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

earnings were $1,532 million, up $303 million from the third quarter
of 2016. Higher refining margins increased earnings by $1 billion. Volume
and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million. All other items
decreased earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable
asset management gains of $380 million in the prior year from the sale of
Canadian retail assets and higher expenses related to Hurricane Harvey.
Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 43,000 barrels
per day lower than last year’s third quarter.Earnings
from the U.S. Downstream were $391 million, up $166 million from the
third quarter of 2016. Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings of
$1,141 million were $137 million higher than prior year. Downstream
earnings of $4,033 million in the first nine months of 2017 increased $1,073 million
from 2016. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by
$1.3 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$110 million. All other items decreased earnings by $290 million, mainly
reflecting the absence of the Canadian retail assets sale. Petroleum product
sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 26,000 barrels per day higher

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2017 was $8.4 billion,
including asset sales of $0.9 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.Cash provided by
operating activities totaled $22.7 billion for the first nine months of 2017, $8.0
billion higher than 2016. The major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $11.4 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion from the
prior year period. The adjustment for the non-cash provision of $14.1 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.1 billion. Changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $2.4 billion in 2016. All other items net decreased cash flows
by $2.3 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $3.5 billion in 2016. See
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details. Investing activities
for the first nine months of 2017 used net cash of $9.2 billion, a decrease of $1.5
billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $10.9 billion was $1.4 billion lower than 2016. Proceeds from
asset sales of $1.7 billion decreased $0.5 billion. Additional investments and
advances were $2.0 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion, and principally reflect
the deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration
payable as a result of the acquisition of InterOil Corporation. Other investing
activities including collection of advances increased cash flows by $2.0
billion, including the return of unused contingent consideration from the
InterOil acquisition escrow, and were up $1.2 billion from the previous year.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2017 was $24.4 billion,
including asset sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.Net cash used by
financing activities was $13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017, an
increase of $10.7 billion from 2016 mainly reflecting the absence of the
Corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion in long-term debt in the prior year. During the first nine
months of 2017, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. These purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the third quarter
of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of InterOil
Corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the Permian Basin. Purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.The Corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter of
2017 through dividends.

Total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017 compared to
$5.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2016.Total debt at the end
of the third quarter of 2017 was $40.6 billion compared to $42.8 billion at
year-end 2016. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 17.7 percent
at the end of the third quarter of 2017 compared to 19.7 percent at year-end
2016.The Corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.The Corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $14.8 billion for the third
quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.0 billion from 2016. Income tax expense
increased by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. The
effective income tax rate was 33 percent compared to 20 percent in the prior
year period reflecting the effect of one-time tax items and a higher share of
earnings in high tax jurisdictions. Sales-based taxes
and all other taxes and duties increased by $0.8 billion to $13.3 billion as a
result of higher sales realizations.Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $42.6 billion for the first
nine months of 2017, an increase of $4.8 billion from 2016. Income tax expense
increased by $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. The
effective income tax rate was 34 percent compared to 26 percent in the prior
year period due a higher share of earnings in high tax jurisdictions. Sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties increased by
$1.6 billion to $38.4 billion as a result of higher sales realizations.In the United States, the
Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. Unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a materially adverse
effect on the Corporation’s net income or liquidity.

Capital and exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2017
were $6 billion, including the Jurong aromatics plant acquisition.Capital and
exploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2017
were $14.1 billion, down 3 percent from the first nine months of 2016 due
primarily to lower upstream major project spending partially offset by the
Jurong aromatics plant acquisition. The Corporation anticipates an investment
level of $22 billion in 2017. Actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. In 2014,
the European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian
energy sector. ExxonMobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the Russian Federation.
See Part II. Other Information, Item 1. Legal Proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the Corporation is contesting.




RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. “Sales and Other Operating
Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the Corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings. The Corporation
expects to adopt the standard using the Modified Retrospective method, under
which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on
the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. The Corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to
have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.In January 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued an updated standard, Financial
Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard requires investments
in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value
recognized through net income. Companies can elect a modified approach for
equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. ExxonMobil
is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2018. In March 2017, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update, Compensation –
Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic
Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The update
requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the
same line of the income statement as other compensation costs and the other
components of net benefit costs (non-service costs) to be presented separately
from the service cost component. Additionally, only the service cost component
of net benefit costs will be eligible for capitalization. The update is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. The Corporation expects to
add a new line “Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense” to its
Consolidated Statement of Income. This line would reflect the non-service costs
that were previously included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and
“Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The update is not expected to
have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial statements. Beginning
January 1, 2018, the Corporation expects to include all of the
non-service costs in its Corporate and financing segment.In February 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard
and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it
in 2019.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
 
As part of its annual
planning and budgeting cycle which is completed in the fourth quarter each
year, the Corporation develops crude and natural gas price outlooks as well as
estimates of future costs and other factors necessary to complete its plan. Management’s
price outlook and other factors, including factors such as operating costs,
resource productivity, and capital efficiency, are re-assessed when facts and
circumstances warrant but no less often than annually. To the extent any
impairment testing may be required, management uses assumptions that are
reasonable in relation to these factors in developing estimates of future cash
flows. An asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows
were less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Development of
future undiscounted cash flow estimates requires significant management
judgment, particularly in cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend
decades into the future, and an important component of the estimate is
management’s outlook on prices and other factors as noted above.
 
The Corporation has
identified emerging trends such as increasing estimates of available natural
gas supplies and ongoing reductions in costs of supply for natural gas. In the
fourth quarter of 2017, the Corporation will incorporate the impacts of these
trends and the resulting lower price outlook in its annual planning and
budgeting cycle. Once complete, the Corporation expects to perform an
impairment assessment for its North American natural gas asset groups utilizing
the information developed as part of the planning and budgeting process. It is
not practicable at this time to estimate the impact these trends would have on
the undiscounted cash flows for individual asset groups or any resulting
impairment charges. However these trends are likely to place the Corporation’s
North American natural gas asset groups at risk for potential impairment. The
Corporation will complete its analysis of relevant factors as discussed above
and perform any necessary impairment testing in connection with the preparation
of the Corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2017
Form 10-K.
 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Future results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; efficiency gains; capital and exploration expenditures; production
rates; resource recoveries; the impact of new technologies; potential
impairment charges; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to
factors including: changes in oil, gas or petrochemical prices or other market
or economic conditions affecting the oil, gas or petrochemical industries,
including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome of
exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government regulation,
including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms and outcome of commercial negotiations; the results of
research programs; changes in technical or operating conditions; actions of
competitors; and other factors discussed under the heading “Factors Affecting
Future Results” in the “Investors” section of our website and in Item 1A of
ExxonMobil's 2016 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements
as of any future date.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Information about
market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, does not differ
materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for 2016.

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2017.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no
changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting.

PART
II.  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings

As last reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter
of 2016, in a matter related to the discharge of crude oil from the Pegasus
Pipeline in Mayflower, Faulkner County, Arkansas, the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) on October 1, 2015, issued a Final
Order arising from a November 2013 Notice of Probable Violation alleging that
ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (EMPCo) violated multiple federal Pipeline Safety
Regulations. The Final Order imposed a penalty of $2,630,400, which EMPCo paid
on April 21, 2016. On June 27, 2016, EMPCo filed an appeal with the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, contesting PHMSA’s regulatory findings and
compliance order directives and seeking a refund of the penalty paid. On August
14, 2017, the Fifth Circuit dismissed five of the six violations EMPCo
challenged from PHMSA’s final administrative order, and vacated $1,634,100 in
associated penalties, which PHMSA must now refund to EMPCo. The Fifth Circuit
also remanded the remaining violation back to PHMSA for re-calculation of the
civil penalty previously imposed. As reported in the
Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2017, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a revised judgment on
April 26, 2017, in a citizen suit captioned Environment Texas Citizen Lobby,
Inc. et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, awarding approximately $20 million
in civil penalties, payable to the United States Treasury. In the suit filed in
December 2010, Environment Texas Citizen Lobby, Inc. and the Sierra Club, Lone
Star Chapter, filed a citizen suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,
penalties, attorney fees and litigation costs associated with alleged
violations of Title V of the Clean Air Act. Plaintiffs alleged that ExxonMobil
repeatedly violated, and will continue to violate, its air operating permits,
the Texas State Implementation Plan and the Clean Air Act by emitting air
pollutants into the atmosphere from the Baytown complex in excess of applicable
emission limitations or otherwise without authorization at the Baytown, Texas,
refinery, chemical plant and olefins plant. ExxonMobil filed its appeal of the
judgment in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on August 25, 2017.As reported in the
Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, the company has been in
discussions with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to resolve claims of non-compliance with
the Clean Air Act related to flaring at its eight U.S. chemical facilities with
flares. The EPA has alleged the sites failed to properly operate and monitor
flares. ExxonMobil Chemical Company has reached a settlement agreement with the
DOJ, the EPA and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to resolve
these claims. The complaint and the consent decree are expected to be filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The company has agreed
to pay a penalty of $2,500,000, and to pay $2,572,000 to fund supplemental
environmental projects. The company has also agreed to make investments in new
equipment at the facilities.As reported in the
Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2017, on July 20, 2017, the
United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
assessed a civil penalty against Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil
Development Company and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for violating the
Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 589. The assessed civil
penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have been
and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any
violation has occurred. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have filed a complaint in
the United States Federal District Court, Northern District of Texas seeking
judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the Administrative
Procedures Act and the United States Constitution, including on the basis that
it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by OFAC and a violation of the
Company’s due process rights.Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further
information on legal proceedings.

(See Note 1)

During the third
quarter, the Corporation did not purchase any shares of its common stock for
the treasury.Note 1 - On August 1,
2000, the Corporation announced its intention to resume purchases of shares of
its common stock for the treasury both to offset shares issued in conjunction with
company benefit plans and programs and to gradually reduce the number of shares
outstanding. The announcement did not specify an amount or expiration date. The
Corporation has continued to purchase shares since this announcement and to
report purchased volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its earnings
release dated February 2, 2016, the Corporation stated it will continue to
acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with benefit plans and
programs, but had suspended making purchases to reduce shares outstanding
effective beginning the first quarter of 2016.

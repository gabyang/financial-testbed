EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Basis of Financial Statement Preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis. The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.2.Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Standard, Leases (Topic 842), as amended. The standard requires all leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability. The Corporation used a transition method that applies the new lease standard at January 1, 2019. The Corporation applied a policy election to exclude short-term leases from balance sheet recognition and also elected certain practical expedients at adoption. As permitted, the Corporation did not reassess whether existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for any existing leases, initial direct costs for any existing lease and whether existing land easements and rights of way, which were not previously accounted for as leases, are or contain a lease. At adoption on January 1, 2019, an operating lease liability of $3.3 billion was recorded and the operating lease right of use asset was $4.3 billion, including $1.0 billion of previously recorded prepaid leases. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment.  Effective January 1, 2020, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s update, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset’s contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and expectations of the future. The Corporation is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.3.Litigation and Other Contingencies Litigation A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. Other Contingencies The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2019, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.In accordance with a Venezuelan nationalization decree issued in February 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project. ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project.ExxonMobil collected awards of $908 million in an arbitration against PdVSA under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce in respect of an indemnity related to the Cerro Negro Project and $260 million in an arbitration for compensation due for the La Ceiba Project and for export curtailments at the Cerro Negro Project under rules of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An ICSID arbitration award relating to the Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) was annulled based on a determination that a prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap on damages in the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil filed a new claim seeking to restore the original award of damages for the Cerro Negro Project with ICSID on September 26, 2018.The net impact of this matter on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition.

Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue.” The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, or results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.


At June 30, 2019, the net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments was (20) million barrels for crude oil, (44) million barrels for products, and (140) million MMBtus of natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments was (19) million barrels for crude oil and (9) million barrels for products.Realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on derivative instruments that were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income are included in the following lines on a before-tax basis:

9. Leases

The Corporation and its consolidated affiliates generally purchase the property, plant and equipment used in operations, but there are situations where assets are leased, primarily for drilling equipment, tankers, office buildings, railcars, and other moveable equipment. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are established on the balance sheet for leases with an expected term greater than one year, by discounting the amounts fixed in the lease agreement for the duration of the lease which is reasonably certain, considering the probability of exercising any early termination and extension options. The portion of the fixed payment related to service costs for drilling equipment and tankers is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally assets are leased only for a portion of their useful lives, and are accounted for as operating leases. In limited situations assets are leased for nearly all of their useful lives, and are accounted for as finance leases.Variable payments under these lease agreements are not significant. Residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants related to leases, and transactions with related parties are also not significant. In general, leases are capitalized using the incremental borrowing rate of the leasing affiliate. The Corporation’s activities as a lessor are not significant.At adoption of the lease accounting change (see Note 2), on January 1, 2019, an operating lease liability of $3.3 billion was recorded and the operating lease right of use asset was $4.3 billion, including $1.0 billion of previously recorded prepaid leases. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment.

In addition to the lease liabilities in the table immediately above, at June 30, 2019, undiscounted commitments for leases not yet commenced totaled $0.8 billion for operating leases and $3.4 billion for finance leases. The finance leases relate to floating production storage and offloading vessels and a long-term hydrogen purchase agreement. The underlying assets for these finance leases were primarily designed by, and are being constructed by, the lessors.

Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW OF SECOND QUARTER 2019 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s second quarter 2019 earnings were $3.1 billion, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared with $4.0 billion a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of lower Upstream realizations, weaker Downstream and Chemical margins, higher scheduled maintenance activity, and increased expenses. These impacts were partly offset by volume growth and favorable one-time items.Earnings of $5.5 billion for the first six months of 2019 were down 36 percent from $8.6 billion in 2018.Earnings per share assuming dilution were $1.28.Capital and exploration expenditures were $15.0 billion, up 30 percent from 2018.Oil-equivalent production was 3.9 million barrels per day, up 5 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was also up 5 percent.The Corporation distributed $7.2 billion in dividends to shareholders.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2019 was $6.0 billion, including asset sales of $33 million, a decrease of $2.1 billion from the comparable 2018 period primarily reflecting lower earnings and asset sale proceeds.Cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.3 billion for the first six months of 2019, $2.0 billion lower than 2018. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $5.8 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $9.2 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $0.1 billion from 2018. Changes in operational working capital contributed $1.0 billion, compared to a decrease of $1.0 billion in the prior year period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2019 versus a reduction of $0.5 billion in 2018. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details. Investing activities for the first six months of 2019 used net cash of $12.7 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $11.4 billion was $3.1 billion higher than 2018. Proceeds from asset sales of $0.1 billion decreased $1.6 billion. Investments and advances increased $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion.Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2019 was $14.4 billion, including asset sales of $0.1 billion, a decrease of $3.6 billion from the comparable 2018 period primarily reflecting lower earnings and asset sale proceeds.Net cash used by financing activities was $0.5 billion in the first six months of 2019, a decrease of $8.5 billion from 2018. The net addition to short-term debt was $7.3 billion compared to a net reduction of $1.4 billion in 2018. During the first six months of 2019, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 5 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.4 billion. These purchases were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding decreased from 4,237 million at year-end to 4,231 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019. Purchases may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.The Corporation distributed a total of $7.2 billion to shareholders in the first six months of 2019 through dividends. Total cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2019 compared to $3.0 billion at year-end 2018.Total debt at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $45.2 billion compared to $37.8 billion at year-end 2018. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 18.5 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2019 compared to 16.0 percent at year-end 2018.

The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.



TAXES                                  Second Quarter  First Six Months      2019  2018  2019  2018     (millions of dollars)                 Income taxes  1,241  2,526  3,124  4,983  Effective income tax rate  34% 44% 44% 42%Total other taxes and duties (1)  8,366  9,003  16,453  17,818   Total  9,607  11,529  19,577  22,801

(1) Includes “Other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses.”

Total taxes were $9.6 billion for the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of $1.9 billion from 2018. Income tax expense decreased by $1.3 billion to $1.2 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 34 percent compared to 44 percent in the prior year period due to favorable one-time tax items. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $0.6 billion to $8.4 billion.Total taxes were $19.6 billion for the first six months of 2019, a decrease of $3.2 billion from 2018. Income tax expense decreased by $1.9 billion to $3.1 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 44 percent compared to 42 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $1.4 billion to $16.5 billion.In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court with respect to the positions at issue for those years. The trial for those tax issues was completed at the end of June and the Corporation is awaiting a decision. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation’s net income or liquidity.

The Corporation anticipates an investment level of approximately $30 billion in 2019. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.




RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective January 1, 2020, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s update, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset’s contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and expectations of the future. The Corporation is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements related to outlooks, projections, goals, targets, descriptions of strategic plans and objectives, and other statements of future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including business and project plans, capacities, costs, and timing; resource recoveries and production rates; and the impact of new technologies, including to increase capital efficiency and production and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could differ materially due to a number of factors. These include global or regional changes in supply and demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals and other market conditions that impact prices and differentials; reservoir performance; the outcome of exploration projects and timely completion of development and construction projects; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms and the outcome of commercial negotiations or acquisitions; changes in law, taxes, or regulation including environmental regulations, and timely granting of governmental permits; war, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies between business lines; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; unexpected technological developments; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis, including large-scale hydraulic fracturing projects; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; the results of research programs; and other factors discussed under the heading Factors Affecting Future Results on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil’s 2018 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Information about market risks for the six months ended June 30, 2019, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018, on January 25, 2018, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (EMOC) received a letter setting forth a potential settlement of a previously issued notice of violation from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) regarding EMOC’s formerly owned Torrance Refinery in California. The SCAQMD contended that the refinery failed to adequately identify and meet the requirements concerning pumps, sumps and other equipment subject to SCAQMD leak detection, repair and reporting requirements over an extended period of time prior to EMOC’s sale of the refinery, in violation of SCAQMD rules and the California Health and Safety Code provisions dealing with air quality. On May 6, 2019, SCAQMD and EMOC agreed on a penalty of $165,000 to resolve the matter, and EMOC has paid the penalty.As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019, on March 20, 2019, the State of California Air Resources Board (CARB) informed EMOC of its intention to attempt to settle an enforcement matter involving the formerly owned Torrance Refinery in California under the California Health and Safety Code. Specifically, CARB contended that the refinery failed to timely calibrate and inspect a greenhouse gas reporting meter as required by the applicable regulations and to accurately report greenhouse gas emissions from refinery operations in 2014 and 2015 in a manner consistent with applicable regulations. The alleged violations have been corrected. On or about June 7, 2019, CARB and EMOC agreed on a penalty of $493,500 to resolve the matter. The settlement agreement has been executed by EMOC, and the company is awaiting execution by CARB.In a matter last reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for first quarter of 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed a complaint and proposed consent decree on March 6, 2019, to settle a pending enforcement action with EMOC regarding alleged violations at EMOC’s Beaumont Refinery in Texas under the Clean Air Act and various sections of the EPA’s Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The DOJ and EPA had contended that EMOC failed to identify hazards, failed to design and maintain a safe facility, and failed to mitigate the consequences of a claimed accidental release related to a flash fire that occurred on April 17, 2013. Additionally, based on an on-site inspection in 2013, the DOJ and EPA claim that EMOC failed to include all covered processes in its risk management program and failed to inspect certain process equipment in a timely fashion. On May 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division, accepted and entered final judgment upon a Consent Decree whereby the parties agreed to a civil penalty of $616,000, payment of $730,000 to a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP), and additional corrective actions to resolve the matter. Payment of the penalty was made on or about May 13, 2019, and completion of the SEP is planned for the second quarter of 2020.As most recently reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019, the DOJ contacted ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (EMPCo) concerning possible civil charges under the Clean Water Act arising in connection with the July 1, 2011, discharge of crude oil into the Yellowstone River from EMPCo’s Silvertip Pipeline near Laurel, Montana. In March 2019, EMPCo reached an agreement with the DOJ on a Consent Decree to resolve the matter. On June 4, 2019, the Consent Decree was entered by the U.S. District Court in the District of Montana, and on or about July 2, 2019, EMPCo paid a civil penalty to the United States in the amount of $1.05 million.As last reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019, on July 20, 2017, the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) assessed a civil penalty against Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil Development Company and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for violating the Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 589. The assessed civil penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have been and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any violation has occurred. ExxonMobil and its affiliates filed a complaint on July 20, 2017, in the United States Federal District Court, Northern District of Texas seeking judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the Administrative Procedures Act and the United States Constitution, including on the basis that it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by OFAC and a violation of the Company’s due process rights.Refer to the relevant portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on legal proceedings.

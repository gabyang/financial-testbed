EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis.The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.



2. Miscellaneous Financial Information
Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost, generally determined under the last-in first-out method (LIFO). The Corporation's results for the first quarter of 2020 included a before-tax charge of $2,777 million, included in "Crude oil and product purchases" on the Statement of Income, from writing down the book value of inventories to their market value at the end of the period. This adjustment, together with a market adjustment to inventory for equity companies included in "Income from equity affiliates," resulted in a $2,096 million after-tax charge to earnings (excluding noncontrolling interests) in the first quarter of 2020. These charges were adjusted throughout 2020 to reflect the current market price of the inventory at the end of each reporting period.In the first quarter of 2020, mainly as a result of declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products and a significant decline in the Corporation's market capitalization at the end of the first quarter, before-tax goodwill impairment charges of $611 million and other impairment charges of $299 million were recognized. The charges related to goodwill impairment were included in “Depreciation and depletion” on the Statement of Income while the charges related to other impairments were largely included in “Income from equity affiliates.”

3. Litigation and Other Contingencies
Litigation. A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.Other Contingencies. The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at March 31, 2021, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.In accordance with a Venezuelan nationalization decree issued in February 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project. ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project.ExxonMobil collected awards of $908 million in an arbitration against PdVSA under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce in respect of an indemnity related to the Cerro Negro Project and $260 million in an arbitration for compensation due for the La Ceiba Project and for export curtailments at the Cerro Negro Project under rules of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An ICSID arbitration award relating to the Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) was annulled based on a determination that a prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap on damages in the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil filed a new claim seeking to restore the original award of damages for the Cerro Negro Project with ICSID on September 26, 2018.The net impact of this matter on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC moved to dismiss the lawsuit. On September 4, 2019, the SDNY dismissed the Contractors’ petition to recognize and enforce the Erha arbitration award. The Contractors filed a notice of appeal in the Second Circuit on October 2, 2019. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition.

At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, the Corporation had $447 million and $504 million of collateral under master netting arrangements not offset against the derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to initial margin requirements.

The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of March 31, 2021, the Corporation has designated $5.3 billion of its Euro-denominated long-term debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue.” The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, or results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2021, and 2020.Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.



The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, was as follows:

9. Sale of United Kingdom Assets
ExxonMobil signed an agreement with HitecVision, through its wholly-owned portfolio company NEO Energy, for the sale of most of its non-operated upstream assets in the United Kingdom central and northern North Sea for more than $1 billion. The transaction is expected to close near mid-year 2021, subject to standard conditions precedent, including regulatory and third-party approvals. The agreed sales price is subject to interim period adjustments from the effective date of January 1, 2021, to the closing date, and has an additional upside potential of approximately $0.3 billion in contingent payments, based on production level and commodity prices. Estimated total cash flow from the divestment will range from $0.7 billion to $1.2 billion, of which $0.7 billion to $0.8 billion is expected in 2021 and the remainder in future years. The Corporation expects to recognize a gain at closing. Estimated gain and net cash flow could change due to market factors and timing of close.


10. Restructuring Activities
During 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted workforce reductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The programs, which are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021, include both voluntary and involuntary employee separations and reductions in contractors.During the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation recorded before-tax charges of $39 million, consisting primarily of employee separation costs, from workforce reductions in Singapore and Europe associated with the global review of staffing levels. These costs are captured in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Statement of Income. For the full year, the Corporation estimates charges of up to $200 million related to planned workforce reduction programs associated with the global review of staffing levels. This does not include charges related to employee reductions associated with any portfolio changes or other projects.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to the workforce reduction programs associated with the global review of staffing levels, which are recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.”

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


In early 2020, the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and petrochemical products experienced two significant disruptive effects. On the demand side, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of the world resulting in substantial reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.While demand for petroleum and petrochemical products has rebounded, the lingering effects of the weak 2020 business environment continued to have a negative impact on financial results in 2021 when compared to periods prior to the pandemic. Signs of improvement are emerging with stronger prices and margins across all businesses when compared to the fourth quarter 2020. However, Downstream margins remain lower when compared to historical levels over the last decade.

References in this discussion to Corporate earnings (loss) mean net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement. Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings (loss), Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and financing segment earnings (loss), and earnings (loss) per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW OF FIRST QUARTER 2021 RESULTS
ExxonMobil’s first quarter 2021 earnings were $2.7 billion, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $0.6 billion a year earlier. The increase in earnings was primarily the result of the absence of prior year unfavorable non-operational impacts, including an inventory write-down and impairments; higher Upstream realizations and Chemical margins; and lower expenses. These impacts were partly offset by lower Downstream margins, winter storm impacts, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, and lower Upstream volumes.Oil-equivalent production was 3.8 million barrels per day, down 6 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production was down 2 percent from the prior year.The Corporation distributed $3.7 billion in dividends to shareholders.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2021 was $9.6 billion, an increase of $3.2 billion from the comparable 2020 period primarily reflecting higher earnings. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $9.3 billion for the first three months of 2021, $3.0 billion higher than 2020. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $2.8 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion from the prior year period. The adjustments for the noncash provision of $5.0 billion for depreciation and depletion was down $0.8 billion from 2020. Changes in operational working capital were a contribution of $2.0 billion, compared to a reduction of $0.9 billion in the prior year period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2021 versus a reduction of $0.1 billion in 2020. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details.Investing activities for the first three months of 2021 used net cash of $2.4 billion, a decrease of $4.0 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $2.4 billion was $3.5 billion lower than 2020. Proceeds from asset sales of $0.3 billion were $0.2 billion higher than the prior year. Net investments and advances decreased $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion.Net cash used by financing activities was $7.8 billion in the first three months of 2021, including $4.1 billion of debt repayments. This compares to net cash provided by financing activities of $8.8 billion in the prior year, due to a long-term debt issuance in the first quarter of 2020.Total debt at the end of the first quarter of 2021 was $63.3 billion compared to $67.6 billion at year-end 2020. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 27.8 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to 29.2 percent at year-end 2020.The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Commercial paper continues to provide short-term liquidity, and is reflected in "Notes and loans payable" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cash and cash equivalents was $3.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $11.2 billion as of first quarter 2021.The Corporation distributed a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders in the first three months of 2021 through dividends.The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.The termination of certain transportation service agreements in the first quarter reduced commitments previously reported at year-end in Form 10-K under “Take-or-pay and unconditional purchase obligations” by approximately $2.3 billion. The majority of those commitments related to the years 2026 and beyond.Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

TAXES
First Three Months 20212020 (millions of dollars)Income taxes796 512 Effective income tax rate33 %481 %Total other taxes and duties (1)7,283 7,497 Total8,079 8,009

(1)Includes “Other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses.”

Total taxes were $8.1 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $0.1 billion from 2020. Income tax expense was $0.8 billion compared to $0.5 billion in the prior year reflecting higher commodity prices. The effective income tax rate of 33 percent compared to 481 percent in the prior year period primarily due to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and the absence of prior year inventory valuation and impairment impacts. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $0.2 billion to $7.3 billion.In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The Corporation filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in U.S. federal district court (District Court) with respect to the positions at issue for those years. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation received an adverse ruling on this suit. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. On January 13, 2021, the District Court ruled that no penalties apply to the Corporation's positions in this suit. The Corporation filed a notice of appeal regarding the substantive issues to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on April 9, 2021. The government filed a notice of appeal regarding the penalty issue to the same court on April 19, 2021. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.




RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
During 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted workforce reductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The programs, which are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2021, include both voluntary and involuntary employee separations and reductions in contractors. In the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation recorded before-tax charges of $39 million ($31 million after tax), consisting primarily of employee separation costs, from workforce reduction programs in Singapore and Europe associated with the global review of staffing levels. These costs are captured in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Statement of Income. Before-tax cash outflows in first quarter of 2021 associated with these activities were $130 million. The Corporation estimates total charges of up to $200 million in 2021 related to planned workforce reduction programs with cash outflows ranging between $400 million and $600 million. This does not include charges related to employee reductions associated with any portfolio changes or other projects. Before-tax workforce reduction savings, including employees and contractors, are estimated to range between $1 billion and $2 billion per year after program completion when compared to 2019 levels.

Capital and exploration expenditures in the first quarter of 2021 were $3.1 billion, down 56 percent from the first quarter of 2020. The Corporation expects 2021 capital spending to be in the range of $16 billion to $19 billion. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. If market conditions continue above the Corporation's planning basis, additional cash will not be used to increase capital investment above this range, but will instead be used to accelerate deleveraging.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Information about market risks for the three months ended March 31, 2021, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020.


Item 4. Controls and Procedures

As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
ExxonMobil has elected to use a $1 million threshold for disclosing environmental proceedings.On April 13, 2021, the United States filed a proposed Fourth Consent Decree Amendment (the “Proposed Amendment”) with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Proposed Amendment reflects an agreed settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the State of Illinois to resolve alleged violations at ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s Joliet Refinery in Illinois of (i) certain New Source Performance Standards and other requirements for refineries as further described in a 2013 Notice of Violation/Finding of Violation and (ii) certain requirements in the original Consent Decree entered into with the EPA in December 2005 (in each case, as previously reported on the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2013 and, with respect to the original 2005 Consent Decree, for the third quarter of 2005). Under the Proposed Amendment, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation has agreed to pay approximately $1.5 million in penalties, including $1,086,640 to the United States Treasury and $428,823 to the State of Illinois, and to implement various measures to reduce emissions at the Joliet Refinery including completion of approximately $10 million in capital improvements. The Proposed Amendment will also replace, supersede, and terminate the original 2005 Consent Decree as it pertains to ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s Joliet Refinery. Once the Proposed Amendment is published in the Federal Register, it will be open to public comment for 30 days before the U.S. District Court may approve it.As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2020, ExxonMobil appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered on April 26, 2017, in a citizen suit captioned Environment Texas Citizen Lobby, Inc. et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corporation. The U.S. District Court had awarded approximately $20 million in civil penalties, payable to the United States Treasury. In the suit filed in December 2010, Environment Texas Citizen Lobby, Inc. and the Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, penalties, attorney fees and litigation costs associated with alleged violations of Title V of the Clean Air Act. Plaintiffs alleged that ExxonMobil repeatedly violated, and will continue to violate, its air operating permits, the Texas State Implementation Plan and the Clean Air Act by emitting air pollutants into the atmosphere from the Baytown complex in excess of applicable emission limitations or otherwise without authorization at the Baytown, Texas, refinery, chemical plant and olefins plant. On July 29, 2020, the Fifth Circuit vacated the U.S. District Court’s penalty award and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. On March 2, 2021, the U.S. District Court awarded $14.25 million in civil penalties, payable to the United States Treasury. ExxonMobil filed its appeal of the judgment in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on April 12, 2021.Refer to the relevant portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on legal proceedings.

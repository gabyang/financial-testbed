EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Basis of Financial Statement Preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis. The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.2.Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Standard, Leases (Topic 842), as amended. The standard requires all leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability. The Corporation used a transition method that applies the new lease standard at January 1, 2019. The Corporation applied a policy election to exclude short-term leases from balance sheet recognition and also elected certain practical expedients at adoption. As permitted, the Corporation did not reassess whether existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for any existing leases, initial direct costs for any existing lease and whether existing land easements and rights of way, which were not previously accounted for as leases, are or contain a lease. At adoption on January 1, 2019, an operating lease liability of $3.3 billion was recorded and the operating lease right of use asset was $4.3 billion, including $1.0 billion of previously recorded prepaid leases. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment.  Effective January 1, 2020, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s update, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset’s contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and expectations of the future. The Corporation does not expect a material change in the credit allowance for trade receivables and continues to evaluate the impact on other financial assets in scope of the standard. 3.Litigation and Other Contingencies Litigation A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. Other Contingencies The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at September 30, 2019, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.In accordance with a Venezuelan nationalization decree issued in February 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project. ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project.ExxonMobil collected awards of $908 million in an arbitration against PdVSA under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce in respect of an indemnity related to the Cerro Negro Project and $260 million in an arbitration for compensation due for the La Ceiba Project and for export curtailments at the Cerro Negro Project under rules of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An ICSID arbitration award relating to the Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) was annulled based on a determination that a prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap on damages in the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil filed a new claim seeking to restore the original award of damages for the Cerro Negro Project with ICSID on September 26, 2018.The net impact of this matter on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC moved to dismiss the lawsuit. On September 4, 2019, the SDNY dismissed the Contractors’ petition to recognize and enforce the Erha arbitration award. The Contractors filed a notice of appeal in the Second Circuit on October 2, 2019. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition.

The fair value is calculated by discounting the remaining obligations by a rate consistent with the credit quality and industry of the equity company.

13


The increase in the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $7.0 billion of long-term debt in the third quarter of 2019. The $7.0 billion of long-term debt is comprised of $750 million of floating-rate notes due in 2022, $750 million of 1.902% notes due in 2022, $1,000 million of 2.019% notes due in 2024, $1,000 million of 2.275% notes due in 2026, $1,250 million of 2.440% notes due in 2029, $750 million of 2.995% notes due in 2039, and $1,500 million of 3.095% notes due in 2049. Additionally, the Corporation replaced a $5.0 billion short-term committed line of credit with a $7.5 billion short-term committed line of credit in the third quarter of 2019.

Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue.” The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, or results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.


At September 30, 2019, the net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments was 12 million barrels for crude oil, (50) million barrels for products, and (146) million MMBtus of natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments was (19) million barrels for crude oil and (9) million barrels for products. Realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on derivative instruments that were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income are included in the following lines on a before-tax basis:

9.Leases
The Corporation and its consolidated affiliates generally purchase the property, plant and equipment used in operations, but there are situations where assets are leased, primarily for drilling equipment, tankers, office buildings, railcars, and other moveable equipment. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are established on the balance sheet for leases with an expected term greater than one year, by discounting the amounts fixed in the lease agreement for the duration of the lease which is reasonably certain, considering the probability of exercising any early termination and extension options. The portion of the fixed payment related to service costs for drilling equipment and tankers is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally assets are leased only for a portion of their useful lives, and are accounted for as operating leases. In limited situations assets are leased for nearly all of their useful lives, and are accounted for as finance leases.Variable payments under these lease agreements are not significant. Residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants related to leases, and transactions with related parties are also not significant. In general, leases are capitalized using the incremental borrowing rate of the leasing affiliate. The Corporation’s activities as a lessor are not significant.At adoption of the lease accounting change (see Note 2), on January 1, 2019, an operating lease liability of $3.3 billion was recorded and the operating lease right of use asset was $4.3 billion, including $1.0 billion of previously recorded prepaid leases. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment.

For the category of exploratory well costs at year-end 2018 that were suspended more than one year, a total of $18 million was expensed in the first nine months of 2019.

11. Sale of Norway Assets
ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Vår Energi AS (Vår) for the sale of its non-operated upstream assets in Norway for $4.5 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to standard conditions precedent, including customary approvals from regulatory authorities. The agreed sales price of $4.5 billion is subject to interim period adjustments from the effective date of January 1, 2019, to the closing date, and obligations for income taxes from the effective date will transfer to Vår. Estimated total cash flow from the divestment is around $3.5 billion after closing adjustments, with expected 2019 cash proceeds of around $2.6 billion and estimated cash flow in future periods associated with deferred consideration of $0.3 billion and an estimated refund of income tax payments of $0.6 billion. The Corporation expects to recognize a gain of approximately $3.5 billion at closing. Estimated gain and net cash flow could change significantly due to market factors and timing of close.

References in this discussion to Corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement. Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW OF THIRD QUARTER 2019 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s third quarter 2019 earnings were $3.2 billion, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared with $6.2 billion a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of lower Upstream realizations, weaker Downstream and Chemical margins, increased expenses, less favorable one-time tax items, and higher scheduled maintenance activity. These impacts were partly offset by Upstream volume growth.Earnings of $8.7 billion for the first nine months of 2019 were down 42 percent from $14.8 billion in 2018.Earnings per share assuming dilution were $2.03.Capital and exploration expenditures were $22.7 billion, up 25 percent from 2018.Oil-equivalent production was 3.9 million barrels per day, up 4 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was also up 4 percent.The Corporation distributed $10.9 billion in dividends to shareholders.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2019 was $9.5 billion, including asset sales of $0.5 billion, a decrease of $3.1 billion from the comparable 2018 period primarily reflecting lower earnings and asset sale proceeds.Cash provided by operating activities totaled $23.4 billion for the first nine months of 2019, $4.0 billion lower than 2018. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $9.0 billion, a decrease of $6.2 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $14.1 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $0.4 billion from 2018. Changes in operational working capital contributed $2.6 billion, compared to a decrease of $25 million in the prior year period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $2.3 billion in 2019 versus a reduction of $1.5 billion in 2018. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details. Investing activities for the first nine months of 2019 used net cash of $18.8 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $17.7 billion was $4.2 billion higher than 2018. Proceeds from asset sales of $0.6 billion decreased $2.6 billion. Investments and advances increased $1.4 billion to $2.5 billion.Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2019 was $24.0 billion, including asset sales of $0.6 billion, a decrease of $6.7 billion from the comparable 2018 period primarily reflecting lower earnings and asset sale proceeds.During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation issued $7.0 billion of long-term debt and used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. Net cash used by financing activities was $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2019, $11.8 billion lower than 2018 reflecting the 2019 debt issuance.Total debt at the end of the third quarter of 2019 was $47.1 billion compared to $37.8 billion at year-end 2018. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 19.3 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2019 compared to 16.0 percent at year-end 2018.The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required. The Corporation replaced a $5.0 billion short-term committed line of credit with a $7.5 billion short-term committed line of credit in the third quarter of 2019.

During the first nine months of 2019, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 5 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.4 billion. These purchases were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding decreased from 4,237 million at year-end 2018 to 4,231 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Purchases may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.The Corporation distributed a total of $10.9 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2019 through dividends. Total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2019 compared to $3.0 billion at year-end 2018.The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

(1) Includes “Other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses.”

Total taxes were $9.8 billion for the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $1.8 billion from 2018. Income tax expense decreased by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 37 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $0.6 billion to $8.3 billion.Total taxes were $29.4 billion for the first nine months of 2019, a decrease of $5.0 billion from 2018. Income tax expense decreased by $3.0 billion to $4.6 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 41 percent compared to 39 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $2.0 billion to $24.8 billion.In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court with respect to the positions at issue for those years. The trial for those tax issues was completed at the end of June 2019 and the Corporation is awaiting a decision, which may be appealed by either side. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation’s net income or liquidity.

The Corporation anticipates an investment level of approximately $30 billion in 2019. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.



RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective January 1, 2020, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s update, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset’s contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and expectations of the future. The Corporation does not expect a material change in the credit allowance for trade receivables and continues to evaluate the impact on other financial assets in scope of the standard.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements related to outlooks, projections, goals, targets, descriptions of strategic plans and objectives, and other statements of future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including business and project plans, capacities, costs, and timing; resource recoveries and production rates; and the impact of new technologies, including to increase capital efficiency and production and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could differ materially due to a number of factors. These include global or regional changes in supply and demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals and other market conditions that impact prices and differentials; reservoir performance; the outcome of exploration projects and timely completion of development and construction projects; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms and the outcome of commercial negotiations or acquisitions; changes in law, taxes, or regulation including environmental regulations, and timely granting of governmental permits; war, trade relations, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; opportunities for and regulatory approval of potential investments or divestments; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies between business lines; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; unexpected technological developments; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis, including large-scale hydraulic fracturing projects; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; the results of research programs; and other factors discussed under the heading Factors Affecting Future Results on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil’s 2018 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

On August 5, 2019, the State of Texas, acting by and through its Attorney General, on behalf of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (State), filed a lawsuit against the Corporation due to an alleged fire that occurred on July 31, 2019, at the Baytown Olefins Plant in Texas. The State alleges that ExxonMobil violated, and continues to violate, the Texas Water Code, the Texas Clean Air Act, ExxonMobil’s permits and promulgated regulations for alleged unauthorized air pollution, unauthorized outdoor burning, nuisance, unauthorized visible emissions, and unauthorized discharge of firefighting wastewater at the plant. The State is seeking civil penalties in an undisclosed amount but likely in excess of $100,000 and injunctive relief against ExxonMobil. The State is also seeking to recover its fees and costs of litigation.As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2019, on March 20, 2019, the State of California Air Resources Board (CARB) informed ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (EMOC) of its intention to attempt to settle an enforcement matter involving the formerly owned Torrance Refinery in California under the California Health and Safety Code. Specifically, CARB contended that the refinery failed to timely calibrate and inspect a greenhouse gas reporting meter as required by the applicable regulations and to accurately report greenhouse gas emissions from refinery operations in 2014 and 2015 in a manner consistent with applicable regulations. The alleged violations have been corrected. On or about June 7, 2019, CARB and EMOC agreed on a penalty of $493,500 to resolve the matter. The settlement agreement was fully executed by all parties on July 15, 2019, and the final settlement payment to CARB pursuant to the settlement agreement was paid on or about August 6, 2019.As last reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2019, on July 20, 2017, the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) assessed a civil penalty against Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil Development Company and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for violating the Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 589. The assessed civil penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have been and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any violation has occurred. ExxonMobil and its affiliates filed a complaint on July 20, 2017, in the United States Federal District Court, Northern District of Texas seeking judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the Administrative Procedures Act and the United States Constitution, including on the basis that it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by OFAC and a violation of the Company’s due process rights.Refer to the relevant portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on legal proceedings.

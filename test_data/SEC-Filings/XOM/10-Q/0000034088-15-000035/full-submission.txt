EXXON MOBIL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.      Basis of Financial Statement PreparationThese unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein
reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a
normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to
conform to the current presentation basis.The Corporation's
exploration and production activities are accounted for under the
"successful efforts" method.2.     Recently Issued Accounting StandardIn
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is expected
to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard
and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements. 3.      Litigation and Other ContingenciesLitigationA variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for
accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation
accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence
of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of
amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better
estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30,
2015, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the
Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase
commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to
be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition. The Corporation's outstanding unconditional
purchase obligations at June 30, 2015, were similar to those at the prior
year-end period. Unconditional purchase obligations as defined by accounting
standards are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable
only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure
financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. 
 
The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as
forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports;
price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of
property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the
Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.  
 
In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May
1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed
the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro
Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its
affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if
ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.
 
On September 6, 2007,
affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued
a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9,
2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the
ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of
expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded
annually until the date of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of
the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double
recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of an earlier award of $908
million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and
a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). 
 
On June 12, 2015, the
Tribunal rejected in its entirety Venezuela’s October 23, 2014, application to
revise the ICSID award. The Tribunal also lifted the associated stay of
enforcement that had been entered upon the filing of the application to revise.

 
Still pending is
Venezuela’s February 2, 2015, application to ICSID seeking annulment of the
ICSID award. That application alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award, the
Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the ICSID award
was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. A separate stay
of the ICSID award was entered following the filing of the annulment
application. On July 7, 2015, the ICSID Committee considering the annulment
application heard arguments from the parties on whether to lift the stay of the
award associated with that application. On July 28, 2015, the Committee issued
an order that would lift the stay of enforcement unless, within 30 days,
Venezuela delivers a commitment to pay the award if the application to annul is
denied. In that event, the ICSID Committee would require, as a condition to the
lifting of the stay, that the ExxonMobil affiliates give a commitment within 15
days that any attempt to enforce the ICSID award will take full account of the
requirement in the award to avoid double recovery of amounts received under the
ICC award.  
 
The United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgment on the
ICSID award on October 10, 2014. Motions filed by Venezuela to vacate that
judgment on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by reducing the rate
of interest to be paid on the ICSID award from the entry of the court’s
judgment, until the date of payment, were denied on February 13, 2015, and
March 4, 2015, respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a notice of
appeal of the court’s actions on the two motions. 
 
The District Court’s
judgment on the ICSID award is currently stayed until such time as ICSID’s stay
of the award entered following Venezuela’s filing of its application to annul
has been lifted. The net impact of these matters on the Corporation’s consolidated
financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation
does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition.

An
affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering
the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's
affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under
the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of
crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In
accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in
Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On
October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award
upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding
damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion
plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian
federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court
to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award.
The Contractors have appealed that judgment. In June 2013, the Contractors
filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to
preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if
necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. At
this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated
financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the
outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the
proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or
financial condition.

7.     Financial
InstrumentsThe fair value of
financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and
other valuation techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial
instruments where the difference between fair value and recorded book value is
notable is long-term debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding
capitalized lease obligations, was $19,001 million at June 30, 2015, and
$11,660 million at December 31, 2014, as compared to recorded book values
of $18,857 million at June 30, 2015, and $11,278 million at December 31,
2014. The increase in the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt
reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $8.0 billion of long-term debt in the
first quarter of 2015. The $8.0 billion of long-term debt is comprised of $500
million of floating-rate notes due in 2018, $500 million of floating-rate notes
due in 2022, $1,600 million of 1.305% notes due in 2018, $1,500 million of
1.912% notes due in 2020, $1,150 million of 2.397% notes due in 2022, $1,750
million of 2.709% notes due in 2025, and $1,000 million of 3.567% notes due in
2045.The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at June 30, 2015, is: Level 1 $18,577 million;
Level 2 $362 million; and Level 3 $62 million. Level 1 represents
quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is
based upon a publicly available index. Level 3 involves using internal data
augmented by relevant market indicators if available.8.     Disclosures

references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and
Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW
OF SECOND QUARTER 2015 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s
second quarter 2015 earnings were $4.2 billion, or
$1 per diluted share, compared with $8.8 billion a year earlier.
Higher Downstream and Chemical earnings were more than offset by the impact of
weaker Upstream realizations and lower asset management gains.ExxonMobil
is delivering on its investment and operating commitments across the integrated
portfolio. Quarterly results reflect the disparate impacts of the current
commodity price environment, but also demonstrate the strength of our sound
operations, superior project execution capabilities, as well as continued
discipline in capital and expense management.ExxonMobil
produced 4 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day, an increase of
139,000 barrels per day, or 3.6 percent. Liquids volumes of
2.3 million barrels per day increased 11.9 percent, benefiting from
new developments in Angola, Canada, Indonesia and the United States.  Earnings
in the first six months of 2015 were $9.1 billion, down $8.8 billion
or 49 percent from 2014.Earnings
per share, assuming dilution, decreased 48 percent to $2.17.Capital
and exploration expenditures were $16 billion, down 12 percent from
2014.Oil
equivalent production increased 3 percent from 2014, with liquids up
8.9 percent and natural gas down 3.6 percent.The
corporation distributed $8 billion to shareholders in the first half of
2015 through $6 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.

earnings were $2,031 million in the second quarter of 2015, down
$5,850 million from the second quarter of 2014. Lower liquids and gas
realizations decreased earnings by $4.5 billion, while volume effects
increased earnings by $330 million driven by new developments. All other
items decreased earnings by $1.7 billion, including the one‑time
$260 million deferred income tax impact related to the tax rate increase in
Alberta, Canada, and the absence of prior year asset management gains.On
an oil‑equivalent basis, production increased 3.6 percent from the
second quarter of 2014. Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per
day, up 243,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was
10.1 billion cubic feet per day, down 622 million cubic feet per day
from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. Project volumes
and entitlement effects offset field decline.The
U.S. Upstream operations recorded a loss of $47 million, down
$1,240 million from the second quarter of 2014. Non‑U.S. Upstream
earnings were $2,078 million, down $4,610 million from the prior
year.Upstream
earnings for the first six months of 2015 were $4,886 million, down
$10,778 million from 2014. Lower realizations decreased earnings by
$10 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$570 million. All other items, primarily the absence of prior year asset
management gains, decreased earnings by $1.4 billion.On
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day
was up 3 percent compared to the same period in 2014. Liquids production
of 2.3 million barrels per day increased 186,000 barrels per day,
with project ramp‑up and entitlement effects partly offset by field
decline. Natural gas production of 11 billion cubic feet per day decreased
407 million cubic feet per day from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in
the Netherlands. Project ramp‑up and entitlement effects exceeded field
decline.The
U.S. Upstream operations recorded a loss of $99 million, down
$2,536 million from 2014. Non‑U.S. earnings were
$4,985 million, down $8,242 million from the prior year.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net
Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of
net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price,
Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover
its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in
ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in
ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2015 was $9.4 billion,
including asset sales of $0.6 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the
comparable 2014 period due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from asset
sales.Cash provided by operating
activities totaled $16.8 billion for the first six months of 2015, $8.5 billion
lower than 2014. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $9.3 billion, a decrease of $9.2 billion from the prior year
period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.8 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.3 billion. Changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $1.5 billion in 2015. All other items
net increased cash by $0.2 billion in 2015 and decreased cash by $1.7 billion
in 2014. For additional details, see the Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows on page 6. Investing activities
for the first six months of 2015 used net cash of $12.8 billion, an increase of
$2.4 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $14 billion was $1.9 billion lower than 2014. Proceeds
from asset sales of $1.1 billion decreased $2.6 billion. Additional investment
and advances decreased $0.3 billion to $0.4 billion. Other investing activities
– net decreased $2 billion to $0.4 billion.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2015 was $17.9 billion, including
asset sales of $1.1 billion, and decreased $11.1 billion from the comparable
2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from asset
sales.During the first
quarter of 2015, the Corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used
part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. Net cash used in financing
activities of $4.0 billion in the first six months of 2015 was $9.4 billion lower
than 2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of ExxonMobil stock in 2015.During the second
quarter of 2015, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 12 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.0 billion. These purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding decreased
from 4,181 million at the end of first quarter to 4,169 million at the end of
the second quarter 2015. Purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.






19



The Corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $4.1
billion in the second quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.Total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015 compared
to $6.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2014.Total debt of $33.8
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. The Corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 15.9 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.The Corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.The Corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s
common stock, or both.Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

quarter of 2015, a decrease of $6.0 billion from 2014. Income tax expense
decreased by $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The
effective income tax rate was 45 percent compared to 41 percent in the prior year period due primarily to
unfavorable tax rate change impacts. Sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $3.6 billion to $13.6 billion
as a result of lower sales realizations.Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $30.6 billion for the first
six months of 2015, a decrease of $13.7 billion from 2014. Income tax expense
decreased by $6.6 billion to $4.3 billion as a result of lower earnings and a
lower effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate was 39 percent compared
to 43 percent in the prior year due primarily to a lower share of earnings in
higher tax jurisdictions. Sales-based and all other taxes decreased by $7.1
billion to $26.4 billion as a result of lower sales
realizations.

Capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2015
were $8.3 billion, down 16 percent from the second quarter of 2014, in line
with plan.Capital
and exploration expenditures in the first six months of 2015 were $16.0
billion, down 12 percent from the first six months of 2014 due primarily
to lower major project spending. The Corporation anticipates an average
investment profile of about $34 billion per year for
the next few years. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions.In 2014,
the European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian
energy sector. ExxonMobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the Russian Federation.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
expected to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. ExxonMobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors
Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in
Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2014 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.


Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Information about
market risks for the six months ended June 30, 2015, does not differ materially
from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form
10-K for 2014.

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2015.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no
changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER
INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings

ExxonMobil Oil
Corporation (EMOC) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) have reached agreement with respect to the revised Notice of Intent to
file a Civil Administrative Complaint (NOI) issued by the USEPA concerning
alleged violations of release reporting requirements under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act at EMOC’s Joliet Refinery previously
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2013.
Pursuant to the settlement, EMOC paid a penalty of $425,000 on July 15, 2015.  As reported in the
Corporation’s 2014 Form 10-K, on January 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of
Transportation Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
issued a $1.05 million penalty assessment against ExxonMobil Pipeline Company
(EMPCo) for alleged violations of the federal Pipeline Safety Regulations in
connection with the July 1, 2011, discharge of crude oil into the Yellowstone
River from EMPCo’s Silvertip Pipeline near Laurel, Montana. On June 12, 2015,
PHMSA denied EMPCo’s petition for reconsideration of PHMSA’s order. EMPCo has
paid the $1.05 million penalty.  Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis.The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.



2. Russia
In early March, in response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced that it plans to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. In light of this, and given the considerable uncertainties surrounding the ongoing operation and future cash-flow generating capability of Sakhalin, an impairment assessment was required, and management determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Corporation’s first quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $3.4 billion largely representing the impairment of its operations related to Sakhalin. On a before-tax basis, the charges amounted to $4.6 billion, substantially all of which is reflected in the line captioned “Depreciation and depletion (including impairments)” on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation's exit from the project would result in quantities estimated at 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves, which represented less than one percent of the Corporation's 18.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved reserves at year-end 2021.The assessment of fair value required the use of Level 3 inputs and assumptions that are based on the views of a likely market participant. As of March 31, the pool of market participants for Russia-based upstream assets was assessed as extremely limited. In arriving at a fair value for its interest in Sakhalin, the Corporation considered, among other things, the current state of sanctions, the regulatory environment within Russia, the statements and actions of potential market participants, and the range and risks of future cash flows that a market participant might consider. Given these significant uncertainties, the likelihood of a third-party market participant agreeing to engage in a transaction for the Corporation’s interest in Sakhalin, as of March 31, was judged to be remote.

3. Litigation and Other Contingencies
Litigation. A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.Other Contingencies. The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at March 31, 2022, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.

The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of March 31, 2022, the Corporation has designated $5.0 billion of its Euro-denominated long-term debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $10.7 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $0.6 billion as of first quarter 2022.Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue.” The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, or results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was as follows:

9. Divestment Activities
In February 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Seplat Energy Offshore Limited for the sale of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited. The agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent and government approvals. If these are attained, the transaction would be expected to close no earlier than mid-year 2022. The agreed sales price is subject to interim period adjustments from January 1, 2021 to the closing date, and has potential for further adjustments based on commodity prices and production levels. Assuming a mid-2022 closing date and based on currently available information, the Corporation expects to recognize a loss of approximately $500 million when and if the potential divestment ultimately meets held-for-sale criteria under ASC 360, following the resolution of certain conditions precedent noted above.Following the end of the first quarter, the Corporation executed an agreement for the sale of ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Romania, consisting of certain unproved Upstream assets, to Romgaz S.A. The transaction is anticipated to close mid-year 2022, and the Corporation expects to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $300 million.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


During the COVID-19 pandemic, industry investment to maintain and increase production capacity was restrained to preserve capital, resulting in underinvestment and supply tightness as demand for petroleum and petrochemical products recovered. Across late 2021 and early 2022, this dynamic, along with supply chain constraints, and a continuation of demand recovery led to a steady increase in oil and natural gas prices. In the first quarter of 2022, tightness in the oil and natural gas markets was further exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions imposed upon business and other activities in Russia. The price of Brent crude oil and certain regional natural gas indicators increased to levels not seen for several years. Additionally, by the end of the first quarter, refining margins improved to levels above the 10-year range, and the tight supply and demand balance is expected to persist. In early March, in response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced that it plans to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. The Corporation remains focused on protecting the safety of employees, operations, and the environment. The Corporation is complying with all applicable laws and sanctions and is currently engaged in transitioning Sakhalin-1 operating activities to another party.The Corporation’s first quarter results include after-tax charges of $3.4 billion largely representing the impairment of its operations related to Sakhalin (see Note 2 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Efforts to transition operatorship to a third party and exit the venture is expected to result in limited hydrocarbon sales and cash flows for the Corporation’s account during the second quarter of 2022, and none following that period. For reference, excluding the impact of impairments and other charges, after-tax earnings related to the Corporation’s interest in Sakhalin in the first quarter were approximately $0.2 billion, and combined oil and gas production was approximately 65 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day. The Corporation's exit from the project would result in quantities estimated at 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves, which represented less than one percent of the Corporation's 18.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved reserves at year-end 2021.
FUNCTIONAL EARNINGS SUMMARY
Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items, are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings (loss), and earnings (loss) per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW OF FIRST QUARTER 2022 RESULTS
ExxonMobil’s first quarter 2022 earnings were $5.5 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $2.7 billion a year earlier. The increase in earnings was driven by higher Upstream realizations and Downstream margins partly offset by charges related to the company's Russia Sakhalin-1 operation.Oil-equivalent production was 3.7 million barrels per day, down 3 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production was down 2 percent from the prior year.The Corporation distributed $3.8 billion in dividends to shareholders and bought back $2.1 billion of common stock.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production. Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Other comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2022 was $15.1 billion, an increase of $5.5 billion from the comparable 2021 period primarily reflecting higher earnings. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.8 billion for the first three months of 2022, $5.5 billion higher than 2021. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $5.8 billion, an increase of $3.0 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.9 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $3.9 billion from 2021. Changes in operational working capital were a contribution of $1.1 billion, compared to a contribution of $2.0 billion in the prior year period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $0.9 billion in 2022 versus a reduction of $0.5 billion in 2021. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details.Investing activities for the first three months of 2022 used net cash of $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.9 billion was $1.5 billion higher than 2021. Proceeds from asset sales of $0.3 billion were essentially flat with the prior year. Net investments and advances increased $0.1 billion to $0.3 billion.Net cash used in financing activities was $6.7 billion in the first three months of 2022, including $2.1 billion for the purchase of 26.2 million shares of ExxonMobil stock, as the Corporation initiated its previously announced buyback program in the quarter. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $7.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting long-term debt repayments of $4.1 billion during the first three months of 2021. On April 29, 2022, the company announced that it is increasing its share repurchase program from up to $10 billion to a total of up to $30 billion through 2023. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be discontinued or resumed at any time. The timing and amount of shares actually repurchased in the future will depend on market, business, and other factors.Total debt at the end of the first quarter of 2022 was $47.5 billion compared to $47.7 billion at year-end 2021. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 21.2 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2022 compared to 21.4 percent at year-end 2021. The net debt to capital ratio was 17.1 percent at the end of the first quarter, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points from year-end 2021. The Corporation's capital allocation priorities continue to be investing in advantaged projects, strengthening the balance sheet and paying a reliable dividend. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. In addition to cash balances, commercial paper continues to provide short-term liquidity, and is reflected in "Notes and loans payable" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cash and cash equivalents was $11.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2022. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $10.7 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $0.6 billion as of first quarter 2022.The Corporation distributed a total of $3.8 billion to shareholders in the first three months of 2022 through dividends.The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

TAXES

(1)Includes “Other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses”.

Total taxes were $11.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $3.2 billion from 2021. Income tax expense was $2.8 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year reflecting higher commodity prices. The effective income tax rate of 40 percent compared to 33 percent in the prior year period primarily due to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. Total other taxes and duties increased by $1.2 billion to $8.4 billion.In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The Corporation filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in U.S. federal district court (District Court) with respect to the positions at issue for those years. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation received an adverse ruling on this suit. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. On January 13, 2021, the District Court ruled that no penalties apply to the Corporation's positions in this suit. The Corporation and the government have appealed the District Court's rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit). Proceedings in the Fifth Circuit are continuing. On March 4, 2022, the Corporation also filed a refund suit for tax years 2010-2011 in District Court with respect to the positions at issue for those years. The Corporation has not recognized asserted penalties for 2010-2011 as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

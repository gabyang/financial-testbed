EXXON
MOBIL CORPORATION
 
NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1.      Basis of Financial Statement Preparation
 
These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion
of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known
accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current
presentation basis.
 
The Corporation's exploration and
production activities are accounted for under the "successful
efforts" method.



2.      Accounting Changes
 
Effective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), as amended. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry and
transaction specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The
standard was adopted using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior
year results are not restated, but supplemental information is provided for any
material impacts of the standard on 2018 results. The adoption of the standard
did not have a material impact on any of the lines reported in the
Corporation’s financial statements. The cumulative effect of adoption of the
standard was de minimis. The Corporation did not elect any practical expedients
that require disclosure. See Note 9.
 
Effective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s Update, Financial Instruments  –  Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.
The standard requires investments in equity securities other than consolidated
subsidiaries and equity method investments to be measured at fair value with
changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The Corporation
elected a modified approach for equity securities that do not have a readily
determinable fair value. This modified approach measures investments at cost
minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of
the same issuer. The cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of
this standard increased equity $47 million. The portion of unrealized gains and
losses recognized during the reporting period on equity securities still held
at June 30, 2018 and the carrying value of equity securities without readily
determinable fair values at June 30, 2018 were not significant to the
Corporation. The standard also expanded disclosures related to financial
instruments. See Note 7.
 
Effective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil
adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Update, Compensation – Retirement
Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost
and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The update requires separate
presentation of the service cost component from other components of net benefit
costs. The other components are reported in a new line on the Corporation’s
Statement of Income, “Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense.”
The Corporation elected to use the practical expedient which uses the amounts
disclosed in the pension and other postretirement benefit plan note for the
prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the
retrospective presentation requirements, as it is impracticable to determine
the amounts capitalized in those periods. Beginning in 2018, the other
components of net benefit costs are included in the Corporate and financing segment.
The estimated after-tax impact from the change in segmentation is
an increase in Corporate and financing expenses of about $100 million for the
second quarter and $200 million for the first six months of 2018. The increase
in the Corporate and financing expenses is offset by lower expenses across the
operating segments. Additionally,
only the service cost component of net benefit costs is eligible for
capitalization in situations where it is otherwise appropriate to capitalize
employee costs in connection with the construction or production of an asset.

change on ExxonMobil's Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months
and six months ended June 30, 2017, is shown below.

Effective January 1, 2019, ExxonMobil will
adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Leases (Topic
842), as amended. The standard requires all leases with an initial term
greater than one year to be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use
asset and a lease liability. The Corporation acquired lease accounting software
to facilitate implementation, and is currently installing, configuring and
testing the software. Based on leases outstanding at the end of 2017, the
Corporation estimates the operating lease right of use asset and lease
liability would have been in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion at that time. The
effect on the Corporation’s balance sheet as a result of implementing the
standard on January 1, 2019, could differ considerably depending on operating
leases commenced in 2018 as well as interest rates and other factors such as
the expiry or renewal of leases during the year.3.      Litigation and Other ContingenciesLitigationA variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at
June 30, 2018, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance
under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other
similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s
estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably
likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the
Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase
commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to
be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition.
 
The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying
degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced
divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price
controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property;
cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the
likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation
vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.
In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007,
by May 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company
(PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This
Project had been operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67
percent ownership interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion
of the Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s
or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the
stipulation that if ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of
the mixed enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would
“directly assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil
refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27,
2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the
Cerro Negro Project.
 
On September 6,
2007, affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID
Tribunal issued a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had
jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral
Investment Treaty. On October 9, 2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final
award finding in favor of the ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion
as of the date of expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that
date at 3.25 percent compounded annually until the date of payment in full. The
Tribunal also noted that one of the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a
mechanism to prevent double recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of
an earlier award of $908 million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro,
Ltd., against PdVSA and a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under
the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.
 
On February 2,
2015, Venezuela filed a Request for Annulment of the ICSID award. On March 9,
2017, the ICSID Committee hearing the Request for Annulment issued a decision
partially annulling the award of the Tribunal issued on October 9, 2014.
The Committee affirmed the compensation due for the La Ceiba Project and for
export curtailments at the Cerro Negro Project, but annulled the portion of the
award relating to the Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) based
on its determination that the prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why
the cap on damages in the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the
amount owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. As a result,
ExxonMobil retained an award for $260 million (including accrued interest). In
accordance with an agreement between ExxonMobil and Venezuela the $260 million
has been fully paid. The agreement does not impact ExxonMobil’s ability to
re-arbitrate the issue that was the basis for the annulment in a new ICSID
arbitration proceeding.
 
The net impact of
these matters on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be
reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the
resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition.
 
An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors
under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of
Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25
percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC
regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the
terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors
initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal
issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects
and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately
$1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned
a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the
same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set
aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal,
Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the
decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21,
2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In
June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability
to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal
by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June
2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC
has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. At this time, the net impact of this matter
on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably
estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the
Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
Corporation's operations or financial condition.

Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic
diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical
businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in
interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. In addition, the
Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage
commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Credit risk associated with the
Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including
the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial
limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation believes that there
are no material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position,
results of operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives. The
Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization,
reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. Derivative instruments are
currently not subject to a master netting agreement, and the Corporation has
not offset collateral against the carrying value. The carrying value of
derivative instruments, none of which are designated as hedging instruments, is
as follows:

(1) Revenue is determined by primary country
of operations. Excludes certain sales and other operating revenues in Non‑U.S.
operations where attribution to a specific country is not practicable.9.     Additional Information on Revenue RecognitionAccounting Policy for Revenue RecognitionThe Corporation
generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products
under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g.,
natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic
price adjustments to reflect market conditions. Revenue is recognized at the
amount the Corporation expects to receive when the customer has taken control,
which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks
and rewards of ownership. The prices of certain sales are based on price
indexes that are sometimes not available until the next period. In such cases,
estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are
finalized when the price is available. Such adjustments to revenue from
performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant.
Payment for revenue transactions is typically due within 30 days. Future volume
delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected
to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases. These performance
obligations are based on market prices at the time of the transaction and are
fully constrained due to market price volatility.“Sales and other
operating revenue” and “Notes and accounts receivable” primarily arise from
contracts with customers. Long-term receivables are primarily from
non-customers. Contract assets are mainly from marketing assistance programs
and are not significant. Contract liabilities are mainly customer prepayments
and accruals of expected volume discounts and are not significant.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.Entitlements - Net
Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of
net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Entitlements - Price,
Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover
its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.Quotas are changes in
ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.Divestments are reductions in
ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2018 was $8.1 billion,
including asset sales of $0.3 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily reflecting higher earnings.Cash provided by
operating activities totaled $16.3 billion for the first six months of 2018, $1.2
billion higher than 2017. The major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $8.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion from the
prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $9.1 billion for
depreciation and depletion was down $0.1 billion from 2017. Changes in
operational working capital reduced cash flows by $1.0 billion, compared to a
decrease of $0.2 billion in the prior year period. All other items net decreased
cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2018 versus a reduction of $1.2 billion in 2017. See
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details. Investing activities
for the first six months of 2018 used net cash of $7.0 billion, an increase of
$0.3 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $8.3 billion was $2.3 billion higher than 2017. Proceeds
from asset sales of $1.7 billion increased $0.9 billion. Investments and
advances decreased $1.1 billion, principally reflecting the absence of the
deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration payable
as a result of the acquisition of InterOil Corporation in 2017. This was partly
offset by cash outflows in 2018 related to the acquisition of a Downstream
business in Indonesia.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2018 was $18.0 billion,
including asset sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily reflecting higher earnings and increased asset
sale proceeds.Net cash used by
financing activities was $9.0 billion in the first six months of 2018, an
increase of $0.7 billion from 2017. The net reduction in short and long term
debt was $1.4 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. During the first six
months of 2018, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 5 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.4 billion. These purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding decreased
from 4,239 million at year-end to 4,234 million at the end of the second
quarter of 2018. Purchases may be made both in the open market and through
negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any
time without prior notice.The Corporation
distributed a total of $6.8 billion to shareholders in the first six months of
2018 through dividends.

Total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion at the
end of the second quarter of 2018 compared to $3.2 billion at year-end 2017.Total debt at the end
of the second quarter of 2018 was $41.2 billion compared to $42.3 billion at
year-end 2017. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 17.6 percent
at the end of the second quarter of 2018 compared to 17.9 percent at year-end
2017.The Corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.The Corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
Corporation’s common stock, or both.Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

2018, an increase of $2.7 billion from 2017. Income tax expense increased by $1.6
billion to $2.5 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. The effective income
tax rate was 44 percent compared to 31 percent in the prior year period. This
increase mainly reflects the absence of favorable one-time tax items and a
higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Total other taxes and
duties increased by $1.0 billion to $9.0 billion.Total taxes were $22.8 billion for the first six months of
2018, an increase of $4.5 billion from 2017. Income tax expense increased by $2.3
billion to $5.0 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. The effective income
tax rate was 42 percent compared to 35 percent in the prior year period due to
a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Total other taxes and
duties increased by $2.2 billion to $17.8 billion.During the first six months of 2018, there were no
significant changes to the Corporation’s reasonable estimates of the income tax
effects reflected in 2017 for the changes in tax law and tax rate from the
enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and following guidance outlined in
the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. The impact of tax law changes
on the Corporation’s financial statements could differ from its estimates due
to further analysis of the new law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections
legislation, guidance under U.S. GAAP, or other considerations. If significant
changes occur, the Corporation will provide updated information in connection
with future regulatory filings.In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing
U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has filed a refund
suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court with respect to
the positions at issue for those years. Unfavorable resolution of all positions
at issue with the IRS would not have a materially adverse effect on the
Corporation’s net income or liquidity.

Capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2018
were $6.6 billion, up 69 percent from the second quarter of 2017.Capital and
exploration expenditures in the first six months of
2018 were $11.5 billion, up 42 percent from the first six months of 2017 due
primarily to increased U.S. drilling activity. The Corporation anticipates an
investment level of $24 billion in 2018. Actual spending could vary depending
on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. In 2013
and 2014, the Corporation and Rosneft established various entities to conduct
exploration and research activities. In 2014, the European Union and United
States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian energy sector. ExxonMobil
continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to
its affiliates’ investments in the Russian Federation. See Part II. Other
Information, Item 1. Legal Proceedings in this report for information
concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which the
Corporation is contesting. The Corporation withdrew from the aforementioned
joint ventures with Rosneft, effective April 30, 2018.The
Groningen field is operated by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), a
Netherlands company owned 50 percent by affiliates of the Corporation. NAM has
a 60 percent interest in the Groningen field. On March 29, 2018, the Dutch
Cabinet notified Parliament of its intention to further reduce previously
legislated Groningen gas extraction in response to seismic events over the last
several years. Affiliates of the Corporation and their partners have actively
been in discussions with the government on the associated implementation
measures which resulted in a signed Heads of Agreement (HoA – agreement on
principles) on June 25, 2018. The HoA stipulates that additional agreements
must be negotiated which will define further details, and the parties will
endeavor to execute them by the end of September. In anticipation of a lower
production outlook, the Corporation has reduced its estimate of proved reserves
by 0.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. In addition, the seismic activity has
yielded various claims. Where losses are probable and reasonably estimable,
liabilities have been recorded. The Corporation does not expect these matters
to have a material effect on the Corporation’s operations or financial
condition. While the future production profile and other considerations related
to the Groningen field could vary depending on a wide variety of factors,
reduced gas extraction in the future is expected to result in lower reported
production, earnings and cash flows than in recent years for the Corporation’s
share of NAM.





RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective January 1, 2019, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Leases (Topic 842), as amended.
The standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year to
be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability.
The Corporation acquired lease accounting software to facilitate
implementation, and is currently installing, configuring and testing the
software. Based on leases outstanding at the end of 2017, the Corporation
estimates the operating lease right of use asset and lease liability would have
been in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion at that time. The effect on the
Corporation’s balance sheet as a result of implementing the standard on January
1, 2019, could differ considerably depending on operating leases commenced in
2018 as well as interest rates and other factors such as the expiry or renewal
of leases during the year.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans and objectives, projections, events or conditions are
forward-looking statements. Future results, including project plans, costs,
timing, and capacities; business growth; integration benefits; resource
recoveries; the impact of new technologies; and share purchase levels, could
differ materially due to a number of factors. These include changes in supply
and demand for oil, gas or petrochemicals or other market conditions affecting
the oil, gas and petrochemical industries; reservoir performance; timely
completion of new projects; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms and the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in law, taxes, or government
regulation and timely granting of governmental permits; war and other political
or security disturbances; the actions of competitors; unforeseen technical or
operating difficulties; unexpected technological developments; general economic
conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; the
results of research programs; and other factors discussed under the heading Factors
Affecting Future Results on the Investors page of our website at
www.exxonmobil.com and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2017 Form 10-K. We
assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.


Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Information about
market risks for the six months ended June 30, 2018, does not differ
materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for 2017.

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2018.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and
communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified

Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) notified XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) concerning alleged violations of
the Clean Air Act and the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation Federal
Implementation Plan regarding the alleged failure of vapor control systems to
properly route tank vapors to control devices at well pads and tank farms on
the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. In January 2018, XTO, the DOJ and the EPA
agreed to the terms of a Consent Decree concerning those alleged violations.
XTO has agreed to pay a penalty of $320,000, install automatic tank gauging on
30 well sites, and monitor and report emissions for three years. The executed
Consent Decree was approved by the United States Federal District Court for the
District of North Dakota – Western Division, in Bismarck, North Dakota, on July
10, 2018.As last reported in
the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2017, the company agreed
with the DOJ and the EPA to resolve claims of non-compliance with the Clean Air
Act related to flaring at its eight U.S. chemical facilities with flares. The
EPA alleged the sites failed to properly operate and monitor flares. The company
reached a settlement agreement with the DOJ, the EPA and the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality to resolve these claims. The complaint and
the consent decree were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Texas on October 31, 2017, and became effective June 6, 2018. The
company paid a total penalty of $2,500,000, and agreed to pay $2,572,000 to
fund supplemental environmental projects. The company has also agreed to make
investments in new equipment at the facilities.On May 24, 2018, the
State of Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil & Gas
Resources Management (ODNR) notified XTO of its interest in settling possible
enforcement of alleged violations by XTO of the Ohio Revised Code, Ohio
Administrative Code, and implementing regulations arising out of the Schnegg
well incident in Belmont County, Ohio, in early 2018. The ODNR alleges the
following violations by XTO: (1) causing brine to be discharged and contact the
ground and/or surface water; (2) failure to place cement in the casing string
per Ohio codes; (3) allowing a well to flow gas uncontrolled; (4) failure to
construct, drill and operate a well in the manner as permitted and planned; and
(5) failure to notify ODNR upon discovery the well had sustained annular
pressure above the prescribed pressure. The ODNR is seeking a civil penalty in
excess of $100,000 as well as injunctive relief, and XTO is working with the
state to resolve the matter.Also relating to the
Schnegg well incident, on May 25, 2018, the State of Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (OEPA) notified XTO of its interest in settling possible
enforcement of alleged violations by XTO of the Ohio Revised Code and
implementing regulations, including but not limited to: (1) failure to maintain
and operate its facility in a manner using good pollution control practices;
(2) failure to provide a malfunction report; (3) failure to complete and
properly report quarterly inspections; and (4) failure to submit site-specific
work practice plans within applicable time limits. The OEPA is seeking a civil
penalty in excess of $100,000 as well as injunctive relief, and XTO is working
with the state to resolve the matter.As last reported in
the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018, on July 20, 2017,
the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) assessed a civil penalty against Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil
Development Company and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for violating the
Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 589. The assessed civil
penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have been
and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any
violation has occurred. ExxonMobil and its affiliates filed a complaint on July 20,
2017, in the United States Federal District Court, Northern District of Texas
seeking judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the
Administrative Procedures Act and the United States Constitution, including on
the basis that it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by OFAC and a
violation of the Company’s due process rights.Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further

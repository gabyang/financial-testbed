EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Basis of Financial
Statement PreparationThese unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all
known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results
for the periods reported herein.  All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature.  Prior year’s data has been reclassified in certain cases to
conform to the 2013 presentation basis.The
Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the
"successful efforts" method.2.     Litigation and Other
ContingenciesLitigationA variety of
claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated
subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation
reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the
need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The
Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the
incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If
a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range
is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that
the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably
estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or
remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible
and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the
contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes
of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well
as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will
continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration
of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the
ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have
a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial
condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2013, for
guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and
its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their
various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no
adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
The Corporation's outstanding unconditional purchase obligations at June 30,
2013, were similar to those at the prior year-end period. Unconditional
purchase obligations as defined by accounting standards are those long-term
commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions,
and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that
will provide the contracted goods or services. 
 
The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its
affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected
from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and
regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production,
imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims;
expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental
regulations.  Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect
upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not
predictable.
 
In accordance
with a nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007,
by May 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA)
assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had
been operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent
ownership interest in the Project.  The decree also required conversion of the
Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one
of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that
if ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture.  ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.  ExxonMobil’s remaining net book investment in Cerro Negro producing
assets is about $750 million.
 
On September
6, 2007, affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) invoking
ICSID jurisdiction under Venezuela’s Investment Law and the
Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. The ICSID Tribunal issued a
decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. The ICSID arbitration
proceeding is continuing and a hearing on the merits was held in February
2012.  At this time, the net impact of these matters on the Corporation’s
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the
Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the
Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
 
An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under
a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of
Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25
percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC
regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the
terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors
initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued
an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and
awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8
billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a
Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the
same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside
the award.  The Contractors have appealed that judgment. In June 2013, the
Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in
order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if
necessary. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However,
regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not
expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's
operations or financial condition.

net pension enhancement and curtailment/settlement cost for the three months and
six months ended June 30, 2012, includes $1,420 million (on a consolidated‑company,
before‑tax basis) of accumulated other comprehensive income for the
postretirement benefit reserves adjustment that was recycled into earnings and
included in the Japan restructuring gain reported in “Other income”.6.     Financial
InstrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments is determined
by reference to observable market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate.  The only category of financial instruments where the difference
between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term debt.  The
estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease
obligations, was $7,454 million at June 30, 2013, and $8,027 million
at December 31, 2012, as compared to recorded book values of $7,098 million
at June 30, 2013, and $7,497 million at December 31, 2012.  The fair value of long-term debt by hierarchy level at
June 30, 2013, is: Level 1 $6,043 million; Level 2 $1,347 million;
and Level 3 $64 million.  Level 1 represents quoted prices in active
markets.  Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is based upon a publicly
available index.  Level 3 involves using internal data augmented by relevant
market indicators if available.

References in
this discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement.  Unless
otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and
Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's
share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW OF SECOND QUARTER 2013 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s results for the
second quarter of 2013 reflect continued strong operational performance and
investments to meet growing demand for oil, natural gas and chemical products
in the years ahead.Second quarter
earnings were $6.9 billion, down 57 percent from the second quarter of 2012. 
Excluding the prior year net gain of $7.5 billion associated with divestments
and tax-related items, earnings were down 19 percent.  Weaker refining margins
and volumes associated with planned refinery turnaround and maintenance
activities negatively impacted Downstream earnings.In the second
quarter, capital and exploration expenditures were $10.2 billion, in line with
anticipated spending plans. The
Corporation distributed $6.8 billion to shareholders in the second quarter
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.Earnings in the first six months
of 2013 of $16,360 million decreased $9,000 million from 2012.Earnings per
share – assuming dilution for the first six months of 2013 decreased 32 percent
to $3.67.

Upstream earnings were
$6,305 million in the second quarter of 2013, down $2,053 million
from the second quarter of 2012.  Higher natural gas realizations, partially
offset by lower liquids realizations, increased earnings by $90 million,
while lower volumes reduced earnings by $70 million.  All other items reduced
earnings by about $2.1 billion, primarily reflecting the absence of a prior
year gain in Angola and higher operating expenses, including reimbursement of
past exploratory costs to Rosneft for the Black Sea and Kara Sea Joint
Ventures.On an oil-equivalent
basis, production decreased 1.9 percent from the second quarter of 2012. 
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was essentially flat.Liquids
production totaled 2,182 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 26 kbd
from the second quarter of 2012.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was flat, as field
decline was offset by project ramp-up and lower downtime.Second quarter
natural gas production was 11,354 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day),
down 307 mcfd from 2012.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and
divestments, natural gas production was flat, as field decline was offset by
higher demand, lower downtime and project ramp-up.Earnings from
U.S. Upstream operations were $1,096 million, $418 million higher
than the second quarter of 2012.  Non‑U.S. Upstream earnings were $5,209
million, down $2,471 million from the prior year.Upstream earnings in the first six
months of 2013 were $13,342 million, down $2,818 million from 2012.  Lower
liquids realizations, partially offset by higher gas realizations, reduced
earnings by $140 million.  Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $340
million.  All other items, including lower net gains on asset sales, mainly in
Angola, and higher expenses, reduced earnings by $2.3 billion. On an
oil-equivalent basis, production was down 2.7 percent compared to the same
period in 2012.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota
effects and divestments, production was down 0.9 percent.Liquids
production of 2,188 kbd decreased 23 kbd compared with 2012.  Excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids
production was down 0.9 percent, as field decline was partly offset by project
ramp‑up and lower downtime. Natural gas
production of 12,278 mcfd decreased 571 mcfd from 2012.  Excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was
down 0.9 percent, with field decline partly offset by higher demand, lower
downtime and project ramp-up.Earnings in the
first six months of 2013 from U.S. Upstream operations were
$1,955 million, up $267 million from 2012.  Earnings outside the U.S.
were $11,387 million, down $3,085 million from the prior year.

Listed below are descriptions of
ExxonMobil’s entitlement volume effects.  These descriptions are provided to
facilitate understanding of the terms.Production
Sharing Contract (PSC) Net Interest Reductions are contractual reductions
in ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes covered by PSCs. These reductions
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve thresholds as specified in the PSCs. Once a net interest reduction has
occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower
crude oil prices.Price and
Spend Impacts on Volumes are fluctuations in ExxonMobil’s share of
production volumes caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels
from one period to another.  For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. According to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to ExxonMobil. These effects generally vary from period to period
with field spending patterns or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.

Second quarter 2013 Downstream
earnings were $396 million, down $6,250 million from the second
quarter of 2012, due primarily to the absence of the $5.3 billion gain
associated with the Japan restructuring.  Weaker margins, mainly in refining,
decreased earnings by $510 million.  Volume and mix effects decreased earnings
by $370 million, due primarily to higher planned maintenance.  All other items,
primarily higher expenses, decreased earnings by $70 million.  Petroleum
product sales of 5,765 kbd were 406 kbd lower than last year's second
quarter reflecting the Japan restructuring and other divestment-related
impacts. Earnings from
the U.S. Downstream were $248 million, down $586 million from the
second quarter of 2012.  Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $148 million were
$5,664 million lower than last year.  Downstream earnings in the first
six months of 2013 of $1,941 million decreased $6,291 million from 2012
driven by the absence of the $5.3 billion gain associated with the Japan
restructuring.  Higher margins increased earnings by $230 million, while volume
and mix effects decreased earnings by $640 million.  All other items, including
higher operating expenses and lower divestments, decreased earnings by $580
million.  Petroleum product sales of 5,760 kbd decreased 483 kbd from
2012.U.S.
Downstream earnings in the first six months of 2013 were $1,287 million,
down $150 million from 2012.  Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings were $654

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash
flow from operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2013 of $8.0
billion, including asset sales of $0.3 billion, decreased $6.0 billion from the
comparable 2012 period.  Lower proceeds from asset sales, driven by the 2012
Japan restructuring, and the timing of tax payments accounted for the majority
of the cash flow decrease.  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $21.3
billion for the first six months of 2013, $8.2 billion lower than 2012. The
major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of
$16.7 billion, a decrease of $10.7 billion from the prior year period.  The
adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.5 billion for depreciation and
depletion increased by $0.8 billion.  Changes in operational working capital decreased
cash flows by $3.0 billion in 2013, primarily due to an increase in inventory. 
Changes in operational working capital increased cash flows by $3.4 billion in
2012 primarily due to changes in payable and receivable balances.  Net gain on
asset sales was $0.4 billion in 2013 and $11.1 billion in 2012.  All other
items net in 2013 decreased cash by $0.7 billion versus an increase of $2.0
billion in 2012.  For additional details, see the Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows on page 6. Investing activities for the first six months of 2013
used net cash of $18.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to the
prior year.  Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $16.1
billion was flat with 2012.  Proceeds from asset sales of $0.7 billion decreased
$5.6 billion.  Additional investment and advances increased $3.2 billion to
$3.5 billion reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Celtic Exploration Ltd.Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first
six months of 2013 of $21.9 billion, including asset sales of $0.7 billion,
decreased $13.8 billion.  This reflects the change in cash flows from operating
activities described above and the lower proceeds from asset sales, driven by
the 2012 Japan restructuring.  Net cash used in financing activities of $7.4 billion
in the first six months of 2013 was $7.9 billion lower than 2012, reflecting short-term
debt issuance in 2013.  During the second quarter of 2013, Exxon Mobil
Corporation purchased 45 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at
a gross cost of $4.0 billion.  These purchases were to reduce the number of
shares outstanding.  Shares outstanding decreased from 4,446 million at the end
of first quarter to 4,402 million at the end of the second quarter 2013.  Purchases
may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.






-18-





The
Corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $6.8 billion in the second
quarter of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding.Total cash and
cash equivalents of $5.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2013
compared to $18.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2012.Total debt of
$19.4 billion compared to $11.6 billion at year-end 2012.  The Corporation's
debt to total capital ratio was 10.1 percent at the end of the second quarter
of 2013 compared to 6.3 percent at year-end 2012.  Although the Corporation issues long-term debt from time to time, the
Corporation currently expects to cover its near-term financial requirements
predominantly with internally generated funds, supplemented by its revolving
commercial paper program.The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  Because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  Additionally, the
Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business
portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such
transactions from time to time.  Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. 
Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock,
or both.  Litigation and
other contingencies are discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Income, sales-based and all other
taxes and duties totaled $22.3 billion for the second quarter of 2013, a
decrease of $4.3 billion from 2012.  Income tax expense decreased by $2.7
billion to $5.8 billion with the impact of lower earnings partially offset by
the higher effective tax rate.  The effective income tax rate was 51 percent
compared to 36 percent in the prior year period, due
to the absence of the lower effective tax rate on divestments.  Sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $1.5 billion to $16.5 billion
reflecting the Japan restructuring.Income, sales-based and all other

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements.  Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting
Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in Item 1A
of ExxonMobil's 2012 Form 10-K.  We assume no duty to update these statements
as of any future date.The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a
variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning
as in any government payment transparency reports.



Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Information about market risks for
the six months ended June 30, 2013, does not differ materially from that
discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2012.

Item
4.  Controls and Procedures

As
indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s
Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer
have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June
30, 2013.  Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that
such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms.  There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On June 24, 2013, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued a revised Notice of
Intent to file a Civil Administrative Complaint (NOI) to the Joliet Refinery.
The revised NOI superseded a May 17, 2013, NOI initially issued. The revised
NOI alleged violations of release reporting requirements under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. USEPA asserts that the Complaint
will allege that the Refinery failed to immediately report two sulfur dioxide
releases on December 17, 2008, and July 20, 2009, to the State Emergency
Response Commission and the Local Emergency Planning Committee, as well as
releases of hazardous wastes on October 31, 2009, and November 1, 2009, to the
National Response Center.  USEPA indicated that it plans to seek a penalty of
$1,326,460 for the violations alleged in the revised NOI; ExxonMobil and USEPA
are discussing the issues at this time.In April 2013,
the California South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) initiated
discussions with ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (EMOC) to settle six outstanding
Notices of Violation (NOV) (five issued to the Torrance Refinery and one issued
to the Vernon Terminal), covering operating years 2010 through 2012 related to
a number of AQMD regulations and applicable Title V permit conditions.  The NOV
issued to the Vernon Terminal was dismissed. The parties entered into a
settlement agreement effective July 3, 2013, and EMOC paid a penalty of $139,000,
in full settlement of the NOVs issued to the Torrance Refinery.In May 2013,
the final agreement was signed between EMOC and California Air Resources Board,
and payment of a $120,000 penalty was made by EMOC, to settle the matter
concerning EMOC’s 2011 California Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Report as reported
in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2013.With regard to
the discharge of oil from the Pegasus Pipeline in Mayflower, Faulkner County,
Arkansas, on March 29, 2013, reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the
first quarter of 2013, on June 13, 2013, the United States, on behalf of the
USEPA, and the State of Arkansas, on behalf of the Arkansas Department of
Environmental Quality (ADEQ), filed an enforcement action against ExxonMobil
Pipeline Company (EMPCo).  The USEPA and ADEQ allege that the discharge
contaminated land, waterways, air and habitat resulting in violations of the
Clean Water Act and various Arkansas environmental statutes and regulations. 
Total penalties are expected to exceed $100,000.Regarding the
matter involving EMPCo’s pipeline integrity management program previously
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2012, on July
2, 2013, EMPCo received a Final Order of the U.S. Department of Transportation
Pipeline & Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) which assessed
a civil penalty of $112,300, reduced from the $151,100 proposed in the original
Notice of Probable Violation.  The penalty included 1) $102,300 for operating
19 pipeline segments without documented hydro-pressure tests and 2) $10,000 for
inappropriately establishing a “Discovery” date for a pipeline condition
requiring repair on one pipeline segment. (A second, similar allegation was
withdrawn.) An additional proposed penalty of $20,800 was withdrawn based upon
a finding that EMPCo had complied with the PHMSA regulations regarding
evaluation and repair of “immediate repair conditions”.  The Final Order
contains a Compliance Order requiring EMPCo to hydro-pressure test certain of
its line segments within one year and further requiring EMPCo to amend its
Integrity Management Procedures in accordance with the order.   On July 22,
2013, EMPCo filed a Petition for Reconsideration with PHMSA asking that the
Agency withdraw the finding of violation with respect to 16 of the 19 pipeline
segments, reduce the proposed penalty and modify the Compliance Order insofar
as it requires hydro-pressure tests of the 16 pipeline segments.  Regarding
the discharge of crude oil into the Yellowstone River from EMPCo’s Silvertip
Pipeline near Laurel, Montana, as reported in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the
first quarter of 2013, the PHMSA is proposing to assess a $1.7 million civil
penalty in connection with this matter and to require additional training of
certain EMPCo personnel. EMPCo requested an administrative hearing to contest
the allegations and the proposed penalty. PHMSA conducted a hearing on July 17,
2013.The Agreed
Final Judgment between the Corporation and Harris County, Texas and the State
of Texas resolving alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at the Corporation’s
Baytown Olefins Plant and Baytown Refinery reported in the Corporation’s Form
10-Q for the first quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2011 was entered by
the 129th Judicial District Court in Houston, Texas on June 11, 2013. Under the Agreed Final
Judgment, the Corporation paid a penalty of $277,500 and $150,000 in
reimbursement of attorney fees incurred by Harris County and the State of
Texas.

Regarding
the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDOH) air enforcement matter previously
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2013, on June
27, 2013, the NDDOH and XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) agreed to a settlement of air
permitting and emission controls issues for listed well sites historically
owned and operated by XTO.   The settlement requires that XTO pay a civil
penalty of $74,400, install appropriate emission controls and revise air
permits to reflect current equipment and operations.  The settlement also
requires that, within 90 days of execution, XTO update the list of well sites
in the settlement to include newly acquired assets with permitting or air
emissions control compliance issues.  It is anticipated that the updated
listing will compel an additional penalty assessment in the future.  
 
Regarding a
matter previously reported in the Corporation’s 2010 Form 10-K and its Form
10-Q for the third quarter of 2012, involving the issuance of a Notice of Violation
(NOV) and likely enforcement action by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) and the United States Department of Justice
(DOJ) relating to the discharge of fluids at XTO’s Marquardt Well Site in Penn
Township, Pennsylvania, on July 18, 2013, the DOJ, on behalf of the USEPA,
filed a complaint and consent decree reflecting a settlement with XTO for
alleged violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The settlement
requires that XTO pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and implement work plans for
well pad spill containment measures, water recycling and periodic reporting of
spills and consent decree compliance to resolve the alleged violations of the
federal Water Pollution Control Act.   Additional enforcement actions by the
state to resolve the issue raised in the DEP NOV are anticipated, but to date,
have not yet been filed.

relevant portions of Note 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further

EXXON MOBIL
CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.      Basis of Financial Statement PreparationThese unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein
reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a
normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to
conform to the current presentation basis.The Corporation's exploration and production activities are
accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.2.      Litigation and Other ContingenciesLitigationA variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at September
30, 2014, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts.
Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the
Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase
commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to
be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition. The Corporation's outstanding unconditional
purchase obligations at September 30, 2014, were similar to those at the prior
year-end period. Unconditional purchase obligations as defined by accounting
standards are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable
only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure
financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. 
 
The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced
divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price
controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property;
cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the
likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation
vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.  
 
In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May
1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed
the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro
Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its
affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if
ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project. ExxonMobil’s remaining net book investment in Cerro Negro producing
assets is about $750 million.
 
On September 6, 2007,
affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) invoking ICSID
jurisdiction under Venezuela’s Investment Law and the Netherlands-Venezuela
Bilateral Investment Treaty. The ICSID Tribunal issued a decision on June 10,
2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of the
Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9, 2014, the
ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the ExxonMobil
affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of expropriation, June 27,
2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded annually until the date
of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of the Cerro Negro Project
agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double recovery between the ICISD
award and all or part of an earlier award of $908 million to an ExxonMobil
affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA
CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC). Judgment was entered on the ICSID award by the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York on October 10, 2014. A motion to
vacate that judgment on procedural grounds was filed by the Republic of
Venezuela on October 14, 2014, and is pending before the court. On October 23,
2014, the Republic of Venezuela filed with ICSID an application to revise the
ICSID award such that it requires repayment of the value of the ICC award to
PdVSA at the same time as payment is made to the ExxonMobil affiliates for the
ICSID award and that provision be made for interest on the amount to be repaid.
Thereafter, pursuant to ICSID arbitration rules, the ICSID award was stayed
pending further action of the Tribunal. On October 27, 2014, ExxonMobil filed a
response with ICSID that contests the application for revision of that award on
both factual and jurisdictional grounds. The ICSID award has yet to be
satisfied and proceedings concerning the award remain pending and so the net
impact of these matters on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results
cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the
resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition.
 
An
affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering
the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's
affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under
the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of
crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In
accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in
Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On
October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award
upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding
damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion
plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian
federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court
to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award.
The Contractors have appealed that judgment. In June 2013, the Contractors
filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to
preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if
necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. At
this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated
financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the
outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the
proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or
financial condition.

6.     Financial
InstrumentsThe fair value of
financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and
other valuation techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial
instruments where the difference between fair value and recorded book value is
notable is long-term debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding
capitalized lease obligations, was $11,568  million at September 30, 2014,
and $6,787  million at December 31, 2013, as compared to recorded
book values of $11,238  million at September 30, 2014, and $6,516  million
at December 31, 2013. The increase in the estimated fair value and book
value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $5,500 million
of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2014. The $5,500 million of long-term
debt is comprised of $750 million of floating-rate notes due in 2017, $500
million of floating-rate notes due in 2019, $1,500 million of 0.921% notes due
in 2017, $1,750 million of 1.819% notes due in 2019, and $1,000 million of
3.176% notes due in 2024. The fair value of
long-term debt by hierarchy level at September 30, 2014, is: Level 1
$10,868 million; Level 2 $637 million; and Level 3 $63 million. Level
1 represents quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 includes debt whose
fair value is based upon a publicly available index.  Level 3 involves using
internal data augmented by relevant market indicators if available.7.     Disclosures

References in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil
(U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement.  Unless otherwise
indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate
and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share
after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.


REVIEW
OF THIRD QUARTER 2014 RESULTS

Earnings
in the period rose 3 percent from the third quarter of 2013, driven by higher
margins and improved operations in the Downstream and Chemical businesses,
partially offset by the impact of lower Upstream realizations. ExxonMobil’s quarterly results
demonstrate the strength of our integrated business model. Integration across
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical gives us competitive advantages in scale,
efficiency, technical and commercial capabilities, regardless of market
fluctuations over the business cycle.Earnings
of $25,950 million in the first nine months of 2014 increased $1,720 million
from 2013.  Earnings per share – assuming
dilution for the first nine months of 2014 increased 11 percent to $6.04. 
Capital and exploration
expenditures for the first nine months of 2014 were $28.1 billion, down
14 percent from 2013.Through the first nine months of
2014, the Corporation distributed $17.6 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

Upstream
earnings were $6,416 million in the third quarter of 2014, down
$297 million from the third quarter of 2013. Lower realizations decreased
earnings by $670 million. Favorable volume mix effects increased earnings
by $340 million. All other items increased earnings by $30 million.On an oil‑equivalent basis,
production decreased 4.7 percent from the third quarter of 2013. Excluding
the impact of the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession, production
decreased 1 percent, with liquids up 0.6 percent and gas down
2.9 percent.Liquids production totaled
2,065 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 134 kbd from the third
quarter of 2013. The Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry reduced volumes by
148 kbd. Excluding this impact, liquids production was up slightly as
project ramp‑up and work programs more than offset field decline,
divestment impacts and higher downtime.Third quarter natural gas
production was 10,595 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), down
319 mcfd from 2013. Field decline and lower entitlement volumes were
partly offset by new production from Papua New Guinea and work programs.Earnings from U.S. Upstream
operations were $1,257 million, $207 million higher than the third
quarter of 2013. Non‑U.S. Upstream earnings were $5,159 million,
down $504 million from the prior year.Upstream
earnings in the first nine months of 2014 were $22,080 million, up
$2,025 million from 2013. Lower prices and volumes were more than offset
by favorable mix effects, increasing earnings by a net $470 million. All
other items, primarily asset sales, increased earnings by $1.6 billion.On an oil‑equivalent basis,
production was down 5.3 percent compared to the same period in 2013.
Excluding the impact of the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession,
production decreased 2 percent.Liquids production of
2,087 kbd decreased 105 kbd compared to 2013.  The Abu Dhabi onshore
concession expiry reduced volumes by 137 kbd. Excluding this impact,
liquids production was up 1.5 percent, driven by project ramp‑up and
work programs.Natural gas production of
11,115 mcfd decreased 703 mcfd from 2013, as expected U.S. field
decline and lower European demand were partially offset by project ramp‑up
and work programs.Earnings from U.S. Upstream
operations were $3,694 million, up $689 million from 2013. Non‑U.S.
Upstream earnings were $18,386 million, up $1,336 million from the
prior year.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s entitlement
volume effects.  These descriptions are provided to facilitate understanding of
the terms.Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) Net Interest Reductions are contractual reductions in ExxonMobil’s share of production
volumes covered by PSCs. These reductions typically occur when cumulative
investment returns or production volumes achieve thresholds as specified in the
PSCs. Once a net interest reduction has occurred, it typically will not be
reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.Price and Spend
Impacts on Volumes are fluctuations in ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes
caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to
another.  For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for
ExxonMobil to recover its costs. According to the terms of contractual
arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can
increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil.
These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns
or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.

Third quarter 2014 Chemical
earnings of $1,200 million were $175 million higher than the third
quarter of 2013. Margins increased earnings by $210 million, with improved
commodities realizations partly offset by weaker specialties. Volume and mix
effects increased earnings by $10 million. All other items decreased
earnings by $40 million. Third quarter prime product sales of 6,249 kt
(thousands of metric tons) were essentially flat with last year's third quarter.Chemical
earnings of $3,088 million in the first nine months of 2014 were
$170 million higher than 2013. Higher margins increased earnings by
$20 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$140 million. All other items increased earnings by $10 million.
Prime product sales of 18,516 kt were up 530 kt from 2013, driven by
increased Singapore production.

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2014 was $12.5 billion,
including asset sales of $0.1 billion, and decreased $1.1 billion from the
comparable 2013 period primarily due to working capital changes.Cash provided by operating
activities totaled $37.7 billion for the first nine months of 2014, $3.0
billion higher than 2013. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $26.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion from the prior year
period.  The adjustment for the noncash provision of $12.8 billion for
depreciation and depletion was flat with 2013.  Changes in operational working
capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2014 primarily due to increase
in inventory offset by payable balances.  Changes in operational working
capital decreased cash flows by $2.7 billion in 2013, primarily due to an
increase in inventory.  All other items net decreased cash by $1.5 billion in
2014 and by $0.2 billion in 2013.  For additional details, see the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 6. Investing activities
for the first nine months of 2014 used net cash of $18.1 billion, a decrease of
$9.4 billion compared to the prior year.  Spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $24.1 billion was $1.2 billion lower than 2013.  Proceeds
from asset sales of $3.8 billion increased $2.9 billion.  Additional investment
and advances decreased $2.4 billion to $1.3 billion reflecting the absence of
the 2013 acquisition of Celtic Exploration Ltd.  Other investing activities –
net increased $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion primarily reflecting the collection
of advances.Cash flow from
operations and asset sales for the first nine months of 2014 was $41.5 billion,
including asset sales of $3.8 billion, and increased $5.9 billion from the
comparable 2013 period due to higher proceeds from asset sales and the absence
of unfavorable 2013 working capital impacts.  During the first
quarter of 2014, the Corporation issued $5.5 billion of long-term debt and used
the proceeds to reduce short-term debt.  Net cash used in financing activities
of $19.1 billion in the first nine months of 2014 was $7.8 billion higher than
2013 reflecting total debt reduction in 2014 and short-term debt issuance in
2013, partially offset by a lower level of purchases of shares of ExxonMobil
stock in 2014.  During the third
quarter of 2014, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 30 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $3.0 billion.  These purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding.  Shares outstanding decreased
from 4,265 million at the end of the second quarter to 4,235 million at the end
of the third quarter 2014.  Purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.

The Corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $5.9
billion in the third quarter of 2014 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.Total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2014 compared to
$5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2013.Total debt of $21.8
billion compared to $22.7 billion at year-end 2013.  The Corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 10.4 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2014
compared to 11.2 percent at year-end 2013.  While the Corporation issues long-term debt from time to time, the
Corporation currently expects to cover its near-term financial requirements
predominantly with internally generated funds, supplemented by its revolving
commercial paper program.  The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  Because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  Additionally, the
Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business
portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such
transactions from time to time.  Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. 
Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock,
or both.  Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

Capital and exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2014
were $9.8 billion, down 7 percent from the third quarter of 2013.Capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of
2014 were $28.1 billion, down 14 percent from the first nine months of 2013 due
primarily to the absence of the $3.1 billion Celtic Exploration Ltd.
acquisition. The Corporation anticipates an average investment profile of about
$37 billion per year for the next several years. Actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.As noted
in Item 1A of ExxonMobil’s Form 10-K for 2013, the Corporation’s results can be
adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our
operations. These include restrictions on doing business in certain countries,
or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. As noted in
ExxonMobil’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, both the European
Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.) have imposed sanctions against Russia
relating to the situation in the Ukraine. On September 12, 2014, the EU and
U.S. imposed additional sanctions relating to the Russian energy sector. In
compliance with the sanctions and all general and specific licenses, prohibited
activities involving offshore Russia in the Black Sea, Arctic regions, and
onshore West Siberia have been wound down.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2017. ExxonMobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors
Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in
Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2013 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.


Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Information about
market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, does not differ
materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for 2013.

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2014.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no
changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER
INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings

ExxonMobil Refining &
Supply Company, a division of the Corporation, entered into a Consent Agreement
and Final Order, effective August 19, 2014, resolving two alleged violations
relating to a purported failure to annually certify operating procedures for
two processes and an alleged failure to fully train contract employees on
practices associated with opening process equipment during two incidents at the
Baton Rouge Refinery in early 2012. These alleged violations were
identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during a
July 2012 inspection of the refinery. The settlement terms, agreed to by
the EPA and the Corporation, require the Corporation to pay a civil penalty in
the amount of $120,000.As reported in the Corporation’s
Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2014, on May 20, 2014, the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a Notice of Enforcement and Proposed
Agreed Order alleging that record reviews and inspections at ExxonMobil Oil
Corporation’s (EMOC) Beaumont, Texas, refinery in 2013 and 2014, identified
deficiencies in the refinery’s cooling tower monitoring activities and one air
emission event, which allegedly violated provisions of the Texas Health and
Safety Code, the Texas Water Code, and the Code of Federal Regulations.
Additionally, TCEQ identified deficiencies in a refinery continuous emissions
monitoring system relative accuracy test audit procedure. The parties have
agreed upon full settlement of the enforcement action which imposes a $200,859
penalty on EMOC. To date, $100,429 has been paid to TCEQ. The balance will be
paid to a Supplemental Environmental Project upon endorsement by TCEQ.Regarding the civil
enforcement investigation related to the April 28, 2012, discharge of crude oil
from the ExxonMobil Pipeline Company’s (EMPCo) North Line Pipeline near Torbert
in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, previously reported in the Corporation’s
Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2013, EMPCo entered into a Consent Decree
with U.S. Department of Justice and the EPA, which was filed in federal court
on August 26, 2014, and approved by the Court on October 17, 2014. EMPCo agreed
to a penalty of $1.437 million which resolved the Clean Water Act allegation.
The allegations raised by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
remain unresolved at this time. Regarding the U.S.
Department of Transportation Pipeline & Hazardous Material Safety
Administration (PHMSA) enforcement action with respect to EMPCo’s pipeline
integrity management program previously reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q
for the first quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2013, on July 15, 2014,
PHMSA issued its decision on EMPCo’s Petition for Reconsideration and reduced
the civil penalty imposed on EMPCo from $112,300 to $101,500 and reduced the
number of pipeline segments required to be hydro-pressure tested from 16 to 7
segments. EMPCo paid the penalty assessed on August 4, 2014.Regarding the
enforcement matter brought by TCEQ concerning alleged exceedances of volatile
organic compound emissions from Tank 22 at the Corporation’s King Ranch Gas
Plant previously reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-K for 2013, the parties
have agreed upon a settlement of the matter, which was approved by the TCEQ
Commissioners on August 20, 2014. The settlement requires the Corporation to
comply with the applicable new source review permit, remove Tank 22 from
service, and pay a penalty of $225,450 consisting of a $90,180 civil penalty
and a $90,180 payment to a TCEQ-approved Supplemental Environmental Project
fund. The remaining $45,090 of the penalty will be deferred and removed if all
of the terms of the settlement agreement are achieved by August 20, 2015.   As reported in the
Corporation’s Forms 10-Q for the first quarter of 2012 and the first and second
quarters of 2014, the EPA issued administrative orders to XTO Energy Inc. (XTO)
for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act at three XTO locations in West
Virginia. In addition, XTO voluntarily disclosed six additional West Virginia
sites to the EPA. One of these voluntarily reported sites has been resolved
with no enforcement action taken. Negotiations continue on a Consent Decree for
the remaining eight sites to resolve outstanding penalty and compliance issues.
It is expected that the EPA will seek penalties from XTO in excess of $100,000
to resolve the matters at all of the remaining sites.Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further
information on legal proceedings.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Basis of Financial
Statement PreparationThese unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects
all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the
results for the periods reported herein.  All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature.  Prior year’s data has been reclassified in certain cases to
conform to the 2013 presentation basis.The
Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the
"successful efforts" method.2.     Litigation and Other
ContingenciesLitigationA variety of
claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated
subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation
reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the
need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The
Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the
incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If
a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range
is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that
the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably
estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or
remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible
and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the
contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes
of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well
as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will
continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration
of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the
ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have
a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial
condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.Other ContingenciesThe Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at March 31, 2013, for
guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Additionally, the Corporation and
its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their
various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no
adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial
condition. The Corporation's outstanding unconditional purchase obligations at
March 31, 2013, were similar to those at the prior year-end period.
Unconditional purchase obligations as defined by accounting standards are those
long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain
conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities
that will provide the contracted goods or services. 
 
The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its
affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected
from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and
regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production,
imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims;
expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental
regulations.  Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect
upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not
predictable.
 
In accordance
with a nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007,
by May 1, 2007 a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA)
assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had
been operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent
ownership interest in the Project.  The decree also required conversion of the
Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one
of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that
if ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture.  ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government
expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project. 
ExxonMobil’s remaining net book investment in Cerro Negro producing assets is
about $750 million.
 
On September
6, 2007, affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) invoking
ICSID jurisdiction under Venezuela’s Investment Law and the
Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. The ICSID Tribunal issued a
decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. The ICSID
arbitration proceeding is continuing and a hearing on the merits was held in
February 2012.  At this time, the net impact of these matters on the
Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material
effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
 
An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under
a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of
Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25
percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC
regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the
terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors
initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal
issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects
and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately
$1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned
a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the
same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside
the award.  The Contractors have appealed that judgment. At this time, the net
impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results
cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of
enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to
have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial
condition.

6.     Financial
InstrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments is determined
by reference to observable market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate.  The only category of financial instruments where the difference
between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term debt.  The
estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease
obligations, was $7,523 million at March 31, 2013, and $8,027 million
at December 31, 2012, as compared to recorded book values of $7,061 million
at March 31, 2013, and $7,497 million at December 31, 2012.  The fair value of long-term debt by hierarchy level at
March 31, 2013, is: Level 1 $6,154 million; Level 2 $1,303 million;
and Level 3 $66 million.  Level 1 represents quoted prices in active
markets.  Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is based upon a publicly
available index.  Level 3 involves using internal data augmented by relevant
market indicators if available.

REVIEW OF FIRST QUARTER 2013 RESULTS

ExxonMobil achieved strong results
during the first quarter of 2013, while investing significantly to develop new
energy supplies.  ExxonMobil’s financial performance enables continued investment
to deliver the energy needed to help meet growing demand, support economic
growth, and raise living standards around the world.First quarter
2013 earnings were $9.5 billion, up 1 percent from the first quarter of 2012.Capital and
exploration expenditures for the first quarter were $11.8 billion, including
$3.1 billion for the acquisition of Celtic Exploration Ltd. The
Corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the first quarter
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

Upstream earnings for the first
three months were $7,037 million, down $765 million from the first quarter of
2012.  Lower liquids realizations, partially offset by improved natural gas
realizations, decreased earnings by $230 million.  Production volume and
mix effects reduced earnings by $280 million.  All other items, including
higher operating expenses, decreased earnings by $250 million.






-14-




On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 3.5
percent from the first quarter of 2012.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement
volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production decreased 1.2 percent.Liquids
production totaled 2,193 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 21 kbd
from the first quarter of 2012 as field decline was partially offset by project
ramp-up in West Africa.  The net impact of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota
effects, and divestments was negligible.First quarter
natural gas production was 13,213 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day),
down 823 mcfd from 2012.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and
divestments, natural gas production was down 1.5 percent, as field decline was
partially offset by lower downtime and higher demand.Earnings from
U.S. Upstream operations were $859 million, $151 million lower than
the first quarter of 2012.  Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6,178 million, down $614 million
from the prior year.

Stronger margins, mainly in refining, increased earnings by $780 million. 
Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $290 million.  All other items,
including lower gains on asset sales, higher expenses, and foreign exchange
effects, decreased earnings by $530 million.  Petroleum product sales of 5,755
kbd were 561 kbd lower than last year's first quarter reflecting the Japan
restructuring and other divestment related impacts.Earnings from
the U.S. Downstream were $1,039 million, up $436 million from the first quarter
of 2012.  Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $506 million were $477 million lower
than last year.

Because of the ongoing nature of
our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for
investors to consider asset sales proceeds together with cash provided by
operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the
business and financing activities.Total cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 billion at the
end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to $19.1 billion at the end of the first
quarter of 2012.Cash provided by operating activities totaled $13.6
billion for the first three months of 2013, $5.7 billion lower than 2012. The
major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $9.8
billion which was flat with the prior year period.  The adjustment for the
noncash provision of $4.1 billion for depreciation and depletion increased by
$0.3 billion.  Changes in operational working capital added to cash flows in
both periods.  All other items net in 2013 decreased cash by $2.6 billion.  For
additional details, see the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on
page 6. Investing activities for the first three months of
2013 used net cash of $10.1 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to
the prior year.  Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment decreased
$0.3 billion to $7.5 billion.  Proceeds from asset sales of $0.4 billion, decreased
$2.2 billion.  Additional investment and advances increased $2.9 billion to
$3.0 billion reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Celtic Exploration Ltd.Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first
quarter of 2013 of $14.0 billion, including asset sales of $0.4 billion,
decreased $7.8 billion from the comparable 2012 period.  Net cash used in financing activities of $6.7 billion
in the first three months of 2013 was $1.4 lower than 2012, reflecting short-term
debt issuance in 2013.  During the first quarter of 2013, Exxon Mobil
Corporation purchased 63 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at
a gross cost of $5.6 billion.  These purchases included $5 billion to reduce
the number of shares outstanding with the balance used to acquire shares in
conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs.  Shares outstanding
decreased from 4,502 million at year-end 2012 to 4,446 million at the end of
the first quarter 2013.  Purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued
at any time without prior notice.






-16-





The
Corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $7.6 billion in the first
quarter of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding.Total debt of
$13.4 billion compared to $11.6 billion at year-end 2012.  The Corporation's
debt to total capital ratio was 7.2 percent at the end of the first quarter of
2013 compared to 6.3 percent at year-end 2012.  Although the Corporation issues long-term debt from time to time and
maintains a revolving commercial paper program, internally generated funds are
expected to cover the majority of its net near-term financial requirements. The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  Because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  Additionally, the
Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio
through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions
from time to time.  Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential
for future growth and attractive current valuations.  Acquisitions may be made
with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.  Litigation and
other contingencies are discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements.  Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors
Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in
Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2012 Form 10-K.  We assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.The term “project” as used in this report does not
necessarily have the same meaning as under SEC Rule 13q-1 relating to government
payment reporting.  For example, a single project for purposes of the rule may
encompass numerous properties, agreements, investments, developments, phases,
work efforts, activities, and components, each of which we may also informally
describe as a “project”.



Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Information about market risks for
the three months ended March 31, 2013, does not differ materially from that
discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2012.

Item
4.  Controls and Procedures

As
indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s
Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer
have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March
31, 2013.  Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that
such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms.  There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

With regard to a matter previously
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2011, in April
2013, the Corporation, without admitting liability, signed an Agreed Final
Judgment with Harris County, Texas, which, upon entry by the court, and without
constituting an adjudication of a violation by ExxonMobil, will resolve alleged
violations of the Clean Air Act at the Corporation’s Baytown Olefins Plant and
Baytown Refinery in Texas in 2011. Under the Agreed Judgment, the Corporation would
pay a penalty of $277,500 and $150,000 in reimbursement of attorney fees
incurred by Harris County and the State of Texas.On March 25,
2013, ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (EMPCo) received from the U. S. Department of
Transportation Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(PHMSA), a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty and Proposed
Compliance Order alleging violations of the federal Pipeline Safety Regulations
in connection with the July 1, 2011, discharge of crude oil into the
Yellowstone River from EMPCo’s Silvertip Pipeline near Laurel, Montana. PHMSA
is proposing to assess a $1.7 million civil penalty in connection with this
matter and to require additional training of certain EMPCo personnel. EMPCo is
contesting the allegations and the proposed penalty and compliance order and
has requested a hearing on this matter. On January 24,
2013, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) announced that it was seeking
civil penalties in excess of $100,000 against ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (EMOC)
to resolve alleged reporting violations in connection with EMOC’s Torrance
Refinery’s receipt of an “adverse verification” on its 2011 California
Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Report.   EMOC has agreed to settlement terms with
CARB which, upon the execution of a final agreement, would require EMOC to pay
a penalty of $120,000 and submit to CARB an updated Greenhouse Gas Monitoring
Plan complying with California law. Execution of a final agreement is currently
anticipated by May 2013. On January 30,
2013, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a Notice of
Enforcement and Proposed Agreed Order alleging that during three emission
events in May and June 2012, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s (EMOC) Beaumont
Refinery violated provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code and the Texas
Water Code.  TCEQ has proposed a penalty of $188,125.  EMOC is in discussions
with TCEQ in an attempt to resolve the matter.In March 2013,
the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDOH) contacted XTO Energy Inc. (XTO)
concerning alleged violations of the North Dakota Air Pollution Control Act and
implementing regulations in connection with air permitting and emissions
controls for XTO’s oil and gas facilities and flares located in the Bakken Pool
in North Dakota.  NDDOH is seeking a civil penalty in excess of $100,000 along
with various corrective actions.  XTO is negotiating with NDDOH to resolve the
open issues. On March 29,
2013, a breach in the Pegasus Pipeline, owned and operated by affiliates of the
Corporation, resulted in a release of oil in Mayflower, Arkansas. The Arkansas
Attorney General has initiated an investigation. ExxonMobil Pipeline Company is
cooperating fully with all federal, state and local authorities and continues
active response operations.Refer to the
relevant portions of Note 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further
information on legal proceedings.

Note
1 - On August 1, 2000, the Corporation announced its intention to resume
purchases of shares of its common stock for the treasury both to offset shares
issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to gradually
reduce the number of shares outstanding.  The announcement did not specify an
amount or expiration date.  The Corporation has continued to purchase shares
since this announcement and to report purchased volumes in its quarterly
earnings releases.  In its most recent earnings release dated April 25, 2013,
the Corporation stated that second quarter 2013 share purchases to reduce
shares outstanding are anticipated to equal $4 billion.  Purchases may be made
in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and purchases may
be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

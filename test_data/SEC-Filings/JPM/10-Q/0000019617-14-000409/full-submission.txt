(a)Basel III Transitional rules became effective on January 1, 2014; all prior period data is based on Basel I rules. As of June 30, 2014, the ratios presented are calculated under the Basel III Advanced Transitional Approach. CET1 capital under Basel III replaced Tier 1 common capital under Basel I. Prior to Basel III becoming effective on January 1, 2014, Tier 1 common capital under Basel I was a non-GAAP financial measure. See Regulatory capital on pages 74–78 for additional information on Basel III and non-GAAP financial measures of regulatory capital.Business OverviewJPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter 2014 net income of $6.0 billion, or $1.46 per share, on net revenue of $24.5 billion. Net income decreased by $511 million, compared with net income of $6.5 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the second quarter of 2013. Return on equity for the quarter was 11%, compared with 13% for the prior-year quarter.The Firm’s results reflected strong underlying performance, notwithstanding industry-wide headwinds in Markets and Mortgage.The decrease in net income from the second quarter of 2013 was driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $24.5 billion, down 3% compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.7 billion, down 6% compared with the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in principal transactions and lower mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by an increase in other income. Net interest income was $10.8 billion, up 1% compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of higher yields on securities, lower yields on long-term debt and deposits, and higher average loan balances, largely offset by lower yields on loans and lower average interest-earning trading asset balances.The provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 increased from the prior year, reflecting an increase in the consumer provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in the wholesale provision for credit losses. The increase in the consumer provision for credit losses was the result of a lower benefit from reductions in the consumer allowance for loan losses, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The current-quarter consumer allowance release was primarily due to the continued improvement in home prices and  delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio. The current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $354 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses, compared to a $1.5 billion reduction in the prior year. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates, excluding PCI loans, of 1.34% and 1.66%, respectively. The wholesale provision reflected a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $156 million, compared to a provision of $76 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $44 million, compared with net recoveries of $67 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rate of 0.06% and 0.09%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding PCI loans, was 1.69%, compared with 2.06% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.0 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $9.5 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $435 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower expense in mortgage production and servicing and lower performance-related compensation in the Corporate & Investment Bank, predominantly offset by higher control costs.CBB average deposits were up 9% and Business Banking loan originations, a record, were up 46%. Client investment assets were a record $205.2 billion, up 19%, and credit card sales volume was $118.0 billion, up 12% from the prior year. CIB maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, and assets under custody were up 14% compared with the prior year. CB period-end loan balances were up 9%, and gross investment banking revenue with CB clients was up 25%. AM reported positive net long-term product flows for the twenty-first consecutive quarter, total client assets of $2.5 trillion and record period-end loan balances of $100.9 billion.The Firm maintained its fortress balance sheet, ending the second quarter with estimated Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-in CET1 capital of $161 billion and a CET1 capital ratio of 9.8%. (Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In measures are non-GAAP financial measures which the Firm uses, along with the other capital measures, to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the CET1 capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 74–78.) The Firm’s supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) was 5.4% and the Firm had $576 billion of high quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) as of June 30, 2014.JPMorgan Chase continued to support clients, consumers, companies and communities around the globe. The Firm provided credit and raised capital of over $1.0 trillion for commercial and consumer clients during the six months ended June 30, 2014. This included $10 billion of credit provided for U.S. small businesses and $296 billion of credit provided for corporations. The Firm raised more than $611 billion of capital for clients. In addition, more than $33 billion of credit was provided to, and capital was raised for, nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities.Consumer & Community Banking net income was $2.4 billion, a decrease of $646 million, or 21%, compared with the prior year, due to higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $11.4 billion, a decrease of $584 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.0 billion, down $131 million, or 2%, driven by spread compression and lower mortgage warehouse balances, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.5 billion, a decrease of $453 million, or 9%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income. The provision for credit losses was $852 million, compared with a benefit of $19 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $357 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.2 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $1.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.5 billion. Noninterest expense was $6.5 billion, a decrease of $408 million, or 6%, from the prior year, driven by lower Mortgage Banking expense, partially offset by higher Credit Card expense. Return on equity for the second quarter of 2014 was 19% on $51.0 billion of average allocated capital.Corporate & Investment Bank net income was $2.0 billion, down 31% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting lower revenue, as well as higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $9.0 billion compared with $9.9 billion in the prior year. Excluding the impact of a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) gain of $355 million in the prior year, net revenue was down 6% from $9.5 billion in the prior year, and net income was down 25% from $2.6 billion in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $6.1 billion, up 6% from the prior year, driven by higher  noncompensation expense, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Return on equity for the second quarter of 2014 was 13% on $61.0 billion of average allocated capital.Commercial Banking net income was $658 million, up 6% compared with the prior year, reflecting a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue. Net revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $27 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $53 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, reflecting spread compression and lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments, partially offset by higher loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $577 million, an increase of $26 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher investment banking revenue. Noninterest expense was $675 million, up 4% compared with the prior year, largely reflecting higher investments in controls. Return on equity for the second quarter of 2014 was 19% on $14.0 billion of average allocated capital.Asset Management net income was $552 million, an increase of $52 million, or 10%, from the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $3.0 billion, an increase of $231 million, or 8%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.4 billion, up $224 million, or 10%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows and the effect of higher market levels. Net interest income was $576 million, up $7 million, or 1% from the prior year, due to higher loan and deposit balances, largely offset by spread compression. Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, an increase of $170 million, or 9%, from the prior year, primarily due to continued investment in controls and growth. Return on equity was 25% on $9.0 billion of average allocated capital and pretax margin was 30% for the second quarter of 2014.Corporate/Private Equity net income was $369 million, compared with a net loss of $552 million in the prior year.Private Equity reported net income of $7 million, compared with net income of $212 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $36 million, compared with $410 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower net valuation gains on privately held investments.Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million, compared with a net loss of $429 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $87 million, compared with a loss of $648 million in the prior year. Current-quarter net interest income was a loss of $10 million, compared with a loss of $558 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefit of higher interest rates and reinvestment opportunities.Other Corporate reported net income of $408 million, compared with a net loss of $335 million in the prior year. The current quarter included $227 million of legal expense, compared with $604 million of legal expense in the prior year. The current quarter included an after-tax benefit of over $200 million for tax adjustments.2014 Business outlookJPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the third quarter and remainder of 2014 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, including the strength of consumers and businesses, U.S. housing prices, the unemployment rate, implied market interest rates, financial market levels and activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business, although each of these factors will affect each of the lines of business to a different degree.Set forth below is a table summarizing management’s current expectations with respect to certain specific revenue, expense and credit items, as well as the related drivers, for the third quarter and the remainder of 2014. These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management, are made only as of the date hereof, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firm’s actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 89 of this Form 10-Q and Risk Factors on pages 9-18 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that  business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, see pages 86–88 of this Form 10-Q and pages 174–178 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

(a)Included operating lease income of $422 million and $363 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $820 million and $712 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Total net revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2014, decreased by $757 million compared with the three months ended June 30, 2013. The decrease was predominantly due to lower principal transactions revenue and lower mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by higher other income. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, total net revenue decreased by $2.9 billion from the same period of the prior year. The decrease was predominantly due to lower mortgage fees and related income, principal transactions revenue, and securities gains, partially offset by higher asset management, administration and commissions income.Investment banking fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, increased slightly compared with the prior year, due to higher advisory and equity underwriting fees, largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees. The increase in advisory fees was related to stronger wallet share of completed transactions. The increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by stronger industry-wide issuance. The decrease in debt underwriting fees was primarily related to lower loan syndication fees on lower industry-wide wallet levels. For additional information on investment banking fees, see CIB segment results on pages 34–39 and Note 6.Principal transactions revenue decreased compared with the stronger results of the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, reflecting, in CIB, lower fixed income markets revenue on historically low levels of volatility and lower client activity across products, as well as lower equity markets revenue on lower derivatives revenue. Private equity gains in the three months ended June 30, 2014 decreased from the prior year as a result of lower net valuation gains on privately held investments. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, private equity gains increased due to higher net valuation gains on publicly held  investments and gains on sales. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see CIB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on pages 34–39 and pages 47–49, respectively, and Note 6.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased compared with the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, reflecting higher net client inflows and the effect of higher market levels in AM and CCB. The increase was offset partially by lower revenue in CCB related to the exit of a non-core product in the second half of 2013. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for CCB on pages 20–33, AM on pages 43–46, and Note 6.Securities gains in the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, decreased compared with the prior periods, reflecting the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. For additional information, see the Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 47–49, and Note 11.Mortgage fees and related income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, decreased compared with the prior periods. For both periods, the decrease was predominantly related to lower net production revenue, driven by lower volumes. The decrease from the three months of the prior year was offset partially by higher mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) risk management results, driven by approximately $220 million of positive model assumption updates on slower prepayments, compared with $79 million in the prior year. MSR risk management results for the six months ended June 30, 2014, were flat compared with the prior year. For additional information, see pages 28–30, and Note 16.Other income increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 compared with the prior year, reflecting a benefit from a franchise tax settlement, the absence of a modest loss on the redemption of trust preferred securities recorded in the second quarter of 2013, and higher auto operating lease income in CCB, resulting from growth in lease volume. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2014, was partially offset by lower valuations of seed capital investments in AM.Net interest income increased in the three months ended June 30, 2014, compared with the prior year; for the six months ended June 30, 2014, net interest income decreased compared with the prior year. The increase from the three months ended June 30, 2013, primarily reflected the impact of higher yields on securities, lower yields on long-term debt and deposits, and higher average loan balances, largely offset by lower yields on loans (due to the  run-off of higher-yielding loans and new originations of lower-yielding loans), and lower average interest-earning trading asset balances. The decrease from the six months ended June 30, 2013, primarily reflected the impact of lower yields on loans (due to the run-off of higher yielding loans and new originations of lower yielding loans), and lower average interest-earning trading asset balances, largely offset by higher yields on securities and lower yields on long-term debt and deposits. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.0 trillion for the three months ended June 30, 2014, and the net interest yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.19%, a decrease of 1 basis point from the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.0 trillion, and the net interest yield on those assets, on a FTE basis, was 2.20%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the prior year.

The provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 increased from the prior year, reflecting an increase in the consumer provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in the wholesale provision for credit losses. The increase in the consumer provision for credit losses was the result of a lower benefit from reductions in the consumer allowance for loan losses, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The consumer allowance release was primarily due to the continued  improvement in home prices and delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio. The wholesale provision reflected a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends. For a more detailed discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see the segment discussions for CCB on pages 20–33, CIB on pages 34–39 and CB on pages 40–42, and the Allowance for credit losses section on pages 66–68.

(a)Included firmwide legal expense of $669 million and $678 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $707 million and $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(b)Included FDIC-related expense of $266 million and $392 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $559 million and $771 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Total noninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2014, decreased by $435 million compared with the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, total noninterest expense decreased by $1.2 billion from the prior year. For both periods, the decrease was driven by lower compensation and other expense.Compensation expense decreased compared with the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, predominantly driven by lower performance-based compensation expense in CIB, lower headcount-related expense in MB, and lower postretirement benefit costs. The decrease in compensation expense was partially offset by higher headcount related to the Firm’s investments in controls. Noncompensation expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, decreased compared with the prior year. The decrease from the three months of the prior year was largely due to lower other expense, in particular, lower FDIC-related assessments, and lower production and servicing-related expense in Mortgage Banking. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the decrease from the prior year was largely due to the aforementioned items, as well as lower legal-related expense in Corporate/Private Equity, and lower foreclosed asset expense. The decrease in both periods was offset partially by investments in controls, and the costs related to business simplification initiatives in CIB. For a further discussion of legal expense, see Note 23.

Income tax expense       (in millions, except rate)Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 ChangeIncome before income tax expense$8,331 $9,298 (10)% $15,838 $18,380 (14)%Income tax expense2,346 2,802 (16) 4,579 5,355 (14)Effective tax rate28.2% 30.1%   28.9% 29.1%
The decrease in the effective tax rate compared with the prior year was largely attributable to lower reported pre-tax income in combination with changes in the mix of income and expense items subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, and the impact of tax-exempt income and business tax credits. The current-year second quarter included tax benefits associated with the settlement of tax audits. In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, the  decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the write-down of deferred tax assets as a result of tax law changes enacted in New York State and lower tax benefits associated with prior year tax adjustments and the settlement of tax audits. For additional information on income taxes, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 86–88.

Consolidated Balance Sheets overview
JPMorgan Chase’s total assets increased by $104.6 billion, and total liabilities increased by $88.5 billion from December 31, 2013. The following is a discussion of the significant changes in the specific line item captions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31, 2013.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banksThe net increase was attributable to a higher level of excess funds, which the Firm placed with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve Banks.Trading assets and liabilities–debt and equity instrumentsThe increase in trading assets was related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB, which resulted in a higher level of debt securities, and to a lesser extent, equity securities.The increase in trading liabilities was related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB, which resulted in a higher level of short positions in debt securities. For additional information, refer to Note 3.Trading assets and liabilities–derivative receivables and payablesThe decrease in both receivables and payables was due to client-driven market-making activity in equity derivatives, and maturities of foreign exchange derivatives. For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on pages 64–65, and Notes 3 and 5.SecuritiesThe increase was largely due to higher levels of U.S. mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, partially offset by a lower level of non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities. For additional information related to securities, refer to the discussion in the Corporate/Private Equity segment on pages 47–49, and Notes 3 and 11.Loans and allowance for loan lossesThe increase in loans was attributable to net originations of wholesale loans, which continued to experience a favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trend. The increase in wholesale loans was partially offset by lower consumer loans, predominantly reflecting seasonality in the credit card portfolio.The decrease in allowance for loan losses was driven by a reduction in the consumer allowance, predominantly as a result of continued improvement in home prices and delinquency trends in the residential real estate portfolio, a reduction in the credit card asset-specific allowance due to increased granularity of impairment estimates for loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), as well as run-off in the student loan portfolio. The wholesale allowance was relatively unchanged, reflecting a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trend. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 51–68, and Notes 3, 4, 13 and 14.


13



Accrued interest and accounts receivableThe increase was due to higher receivables from security sales that did not settle, and higher client receivables, reflecting client-driven market-making activity in CIB.Mortgage servicing rightsThe decrease was predominantly due to the impact of total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 16.DepositsThe increase was attributable to higher consumer and wholesale deposits. The increase in consumer deposits reflected a continuing positive growth trend, which was the result of strong customer retention, maturing of recent branch builds, and net new business. The increase in wholesale deposits was related to strong client deposit inflows toward the end of June 2014. For more information on consumer deposits, refer to the CCB segment discussion on pages 20–33; the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 81–85; and Notes 3 and 17. For more information on wholesale client deposits, refer to the AM, CB and CIB segment discussions on pages 43–46, pages 40–42 and pages 34–39, respectively.Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreementsThe increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements was predominantly due to higher financing of the Firm’s trading assets-debt and equity instruments as well as investment securities portfolio, and a change in the mix of the Firm’s funding sources. For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, see pages 81–85.Accounts payable and other liabilitiesThe increase was attributable to higher client short positions and higher payables from security purchases that did not settle, both in CIB; and higher payables to merchants pending settlement of sales transactions in Card. The increase was partially offset by a decline in other liabilities in Corporate, largely reflecting the settlement of previously disclosed legal and regulatory matters.Stockholders’ equityThe increase was due to net income, preferred stock issuances, and higher accumulated other comprehensive income. The increase was partially offset by the declaration of cash dividends on common and preferred stock, and repurchases of common stock. For additional information on accumulated other comprehensive income, see Note 19; for the Firm’s capital actions, see Capital actions on pages 79-80.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
JPMorgan Chase is involved with several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of variable interest entity (“VIE”), and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). For further discussion, see Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Cash Obligations on pages 77–79 and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

Special-purpose entities
The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, including the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees. For further information on the types of SPEs, see Note 15 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 1 and Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.
Implications of a credit rating downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., could be required to provide funding if its short-term credit rating were downgraded below specific levels, primarily “P-1,” “A-1” and “F1” for Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, respectively. These liquidity commitments support the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by Firm-administered consolidated SPEs. In the event of a short-term credit rating downgrade, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., absent other solutions, would be required to provide funding to the SPE, if the commercial paper could not be reissued as it matured. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding held by third parties as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was $9.7 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding could increase in future periods should clients of the Firm-administered consolidated SPEs draw down on certain unfunded lending-related commitments. These unfunded lending-related commitments were $9.2 billion at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The Firm could facilitate the refinancing of some of the clients’ assets in order to reduce the funding obligation.




Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments, and the Firm’s accounting for them, see Lending-related commitments on page 64 and Note 21 (including the table that presents the related amounts by contractual maturity as of June 30, 2014). For a discussion of loan repurchase liabilities, see Note 21.

Operating activities
Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities, and market conditions. The Firm believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and its ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Firm’s operating liquidity needs.Cash provided by operating activities predominantly resulted from net income after noncash operating adjustments; a decrease in other assets driven by lower cash margin balances placed with exchanges and clearing houses; and higher net proceeds from loan sales activities. Cash provided during 2013 predominantly resulted from lower trading assets from client-driven market-making activities in CIB, and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities predominantly due to higher brokerage payables; partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables due to higher brokerage receivables and margin loan balances from client-driven activities predominantly in CIB; and the timing of merchant receivables payments related to CCB’s Card Services business.

Investing activitiesCash used in investing activities during 2014 and 2013 predominantly resulted from increases in deposits with banks reflecting the placement of the Firm’s excess funds with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve banks; and, in 2014, net purchases of investment securities. Additionally in 2014, loans increased due to net originations of wholesale loans, which continued to experience a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends. Partially offsetting cash outflows in 2013 was a decline in securities purchased under resale agreements due to a shift in the deployment of the Firm’s excess cash by Treasury; and a decline in available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities from proceeds of net maturities and sales.Financing activitiesCash provided by financing activities in 2014 predominantly resulted from higher consumer and wholesale deposits — the increase in consumer deposits reflected a continuing positive growth trend, which was the result of strong customer retention, maturing of recent branch builds, and net new business; an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements due to higher financing of the Firm’s trading assets-debt and equity instruments as well as investment securities portfolio, and a change in the mix of the Firm’s funding sources; and proceeds from preferred stock issuances. Further, issuances of long-term borrowings were offset by maturities and redemptions. Cash provided in 2013 was predominantly driven by net proceeds from long-term borrowings; an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements predominantly due to higher secured financing of the Firm’s assets and higher client financing activity; and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. Partially offsetting these cash inflows in 2014 and 2013 were repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends on common and preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”); these financial statements appear on pages 90–94. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in  the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the business-segment level, because it believes these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the business segment with the performance of its competitors. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.


The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a)Predominantly recognized in CIB and CB business segments and Corporate/Private Equity.Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a  percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.

(a)Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in non-taxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE.Additionally, certain capital ratios disclosed by the Firm are non-GAAP measures. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 74–78.Core net interest incomeIn addition to reviewing net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews core net interest income to assess the performance of its core lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. Core net interest income excludes the impact of  CIB’s market-based activities. Because of the exclusion of CIB’s market-based net interest income and the related assets, the core data presented below are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this data provides investors and analysts a more meaningful measure by which to analyze the non-market-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on core lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable.(c)For a reconciliation of net interest income on a reported and managed basis, see reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis on page 17.Quarterly and year-to-date resultsCore net interest income increased by $488 million to $10.0 billion and by $662 million to $19.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared with the prior year periods. Core average interest-earning assets increased by $53.7 billion to $1.5 trillion, and by $82.2 billion to $1.5 trillion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared with the prior year periods. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher yields on securities, lower yields on long-term debt and  deposits, partially offset by lower yields on loans due to run-off of higher yielding loans and originations of lower yielding loans. The increase in average interest-earning assets primarily reflected the impact of higher average balance of deposits with banks. These changes in net interest income and interest-earning assets resulted in the core net interest yield increasing by 4 basis points to 2.64% for the three months ended June 30, 2014, and decreasing by 6 basis points to 2.65% for the six months ended June 30, 2014.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, on pages 17–18.Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results allocates income and expense using market-based methodologies. The Firm continues to  assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.For a further discussion of those methodologies, see Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 84–85 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Business segment capital allocation changesEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In) and economic risk measures. The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm revised the capital allocated to certain businesses. For further information about these capital changes, see Line of business equity on page 79.

Quarterly resultsConsumer & Community Banking net income was $2.4 billion, a decrease of $646 million, or 21%, compared with the prior year, due to higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.Net revenue was $11.4 billion, a decrease of $584 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.0 billion, down $131 million, or 2%, driven by spread compression and lower mortgage warehouse balances, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.5 billion, a decrease of $453 million, or 9%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income.The provision for credit losses was $852 million, compared with a benefit of $19 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $357 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.2 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $1.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.5 billion. For more information, including net charge-off amounts and rates, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–59. Noninterest expense was $6.5 billion, a decrease of $408 million, or 6%, from the prior year, driven by lower Mortgage Banking expense, partially offset by higher Credit Card expense.Year-to-date resultsConsumer & Community Banking net income was $4.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 23%, compared with the prior year, due to lower net revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.Net revenue was $21.9 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion, or 7%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $14.0 billion, down $314 million, or 2%, driven by spread compression in Credit Card, Auto and Consumer & Business Banking and by lower mortgage warehouse balances, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $7.9 billion, a decrease of $1.4 billion, or 15%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income.The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, compared with $530 million in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $807 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $2.5 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $2.7 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $3.2 billion. For more information, including net charge-off amounts and rates, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–59. Noninterest expense was $12.9 billion, a decrease of $761 million, or 6%, from the prior year, driven by lower Mortgage Banking expense, partially offset by higher Credit Card expense.

(a)Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rates excluded $48 million and $109 million of write-offs in the PCI portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. For further information, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–129 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.(b)The 30+ day delinquency rate for PCI loans was 14.08% and 17.92% at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(c)Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as they are all performing.Mortgage servicing-related mattersThe financial crisis resulted in unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of 1-4 family residential real estate loans. Such loans required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. Foreclosure is usually a last resort, and accordingly, the Firm has made, and continues to make, significant efforts to help borrowers remain in their homes.The Firm has entered into various Consent Orders and settlements with federal and state governmental agencies and private parties related to mortgage servicing, origination, and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. The requirements of these Consent Orders and settlements vary, but in the aggregate, include cash compensatory payments (in addition to fines) and/or “borrower relief”, that may include principal reductions, refinancing, short sale assistance, and other specified types of borrower relief. Other obligations required under certain Consent Orders and settlements, as well as under new  regulatory requirements, include enhanced mortgage servicing and foreclosure standards and processes. The Firm has satisfied or is committed to satisfying these obligations within the mandated timeframes.The mortgage servicing Consent Orders and settlements are subject to ongoing oversight by the Mortgage Compliance Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors. In addition, certain of the Consent Orders and settlements are the subject of ongoing reporting to various regulators and independent overseers.The Firm’s compliance with the Global Settlement and the RMBS Settlement are detailed in periodic reports published by the independent overseers.For further information on these settlements and Consent Orders, see Note 2 and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

Quarterly resultsCard, Merchant Services & Auto net income was $840 million, a decrease of $409 million, or 33%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher provision for credit losses, higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue.Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down $117 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, down $162 million compared with the prior year, driven by spread compression. Noninterest revenue was $1.4 billion, up $45 million from the prior year, driven by higher net interchange income, largely offset by higher amortization of new account origination costs.The provision for credit losses was $974 million, compared with $564 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a $53 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses, primarily in Student. The prior year provision reflected a $550 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses.Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, up $136 million, or 7% from the prior year, largely driven by investments in controls, timing of marketing investment in Credit Card and higher legal expense. Year-to-date resultsCard, Merchant Services & Auto net income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $599 million, or 24%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue.Net revenue was $9.1 billion, down $326 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $6.4 billion, down $364 million compared with the prior year, driven by spread compression. Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion, up $38 million compared with the prior year, driven by higher net interchange income and auto lease income, predominately offset by higher amortization of new account origination costs and lower revenue from an exited non-core product.The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflects lower net charge-offs and a $303 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The reduction in the allowance for loan losses is primarily related to a decrease in the asset-specific allowance resulting from increased granularity of the impairment estimates related to credit card loans modified in TDRs and run-off in the student loan portfolio. The prior-year provision included a $1.1 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Noninterest expense was $4.1 billion, up $162 million, or 4% from the prior year primarily driven by investments in controls, higher operating lease depreciation and higher legal expense, partially offset by a regulatory charge in the prior year.

Note: Prior to January 1, 2014, CIB provided several non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of implementing the funding valuation adjustment (“FVA”) framework (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on: net revenue, net income, overhead ratio, compensation ratio and return on equity. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the Firm did not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business performance; however, the Firm continues to present these non-GAAP measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB in those prior periods.

(a)Consists primarily of credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed by the credit portfolio group, and FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on OTC derivatives and structured notes. Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.Quarterly resultsNet income was $2.0 billion, down 31% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior year. These results primarily reflected lower revenue, as well as higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $9.0 billion compared with $9.9 billion in the prior year. Excluding the impact of a DVA gain of $355 million in the prior year, net revenue was down 6% from $9.5 billion, and net income was down 25% from $2.6 billion.Banking revenue was $3.1 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.8 billion, up 3% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher advisory fees of $397 million, up 31% from the prior year on stronger wallet share of completed transactions, as well as higher equity underwriting fees of $477 million, up 4% from the prior year on stronger industry-wide issuance. These were partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees of $899 million, down 6% from the prior year, primarily related to lower loan syndication fees on lower industry-wide wallet levels. Treasury Services revenue was $1.0 billion, down 4% compared with the prior year driven by lower trade finance revenue as well as the impact of business simplification initiatives. Lending revenue was $297 million, down from $373 million in the prior year primarily due to lower net interest income.Markets & Investor Services revenue was $5.9 billion, down 12% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $3.5 billion was down 15% from the prior year on historically low levels of volatility and lower client activity across products.

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. The Firm employs a holistic approach to risk management that is intended to ensure the broad spectrum of risk types inherent in the Firm’s business activities are considered in managing its business activities.The Firm believes effective risk management requires:•Personal responsibility for risk management, including identification and escalation of risk issues by all individuals within the Firm;•Ownership of risk management within each line of business; and•Firmwide structures for risk governance and oversight.Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) and Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) develop and set the risk management framework and governance structure for the Firm, which is intended to provide comprehensive controls and ongoing management of the

major risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities. The Firm’s risk management framework is designed to create a culture of risk transparency and awareness and personal responsibility throughout the Firm where collaboration, discussion, escalation and sharing of information are encouraged. The CEO, CFO, CRO and COO are ultimately responsible and accountable to the Firm’s Board of Directors.Employees are expected to operate with the highest standards of integrity and identify, escalate, and actively manage risk issues. The Firm’s risk culture strives for continual improvement through ongoing employee training and development, as well as talent retention. The Firm also approaches its incentive compensation arrangements through an integrated risk, compensation and financial management framework to encourage a culture of risk awareness and personal accountability. The Firm’s overall objective in managing risk is to protect the safety and soundness of the Firm, and avoid excessive risk taking.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, business banking loans, and student loans. The Firm’s focus is on serving the prime segment of the consumer credit market. For further information on consumer loans, see Note 13 of this Form 10-Q and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–129 and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to benefit from the improvement in the economy and home prices. Early-stage residential real estate delinquencies (30–89 days delinquent), excluding government guaranteed loans, declined during the first half of the year. Late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) continued to decline but remain elevated. The elevated level of the late-stage delinquent loans is due to loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Losses related to these loans continue to be recognized in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off practices, but some delinquent loans that would otherwise have been foreclosed upon remain in the mortgage and home equity loan portfolios. The Credit Card 30+ day delinquency rate is at a historic low and continues to improve.The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the credit portfolio held by CCB as well as for prime mortgage loans held in the Asset Management and the Corporate/Private Equity segments for the dates indicated.

See Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–129 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report for further details.(i)Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $710 million and $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and $683 million and $4 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off rates.

Consumer, excluding credit cardPortfolio analysisConsumer loan balances were relatively flat during the six months ended June 30, 2014, as prime mortgage, business banking and auto originations were offset by paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Credit performance has improved across most portfolios but delinquent residential real estate loans and home equity charge-offs remain elevated compared with pre-recessionary levels.In the following discussion of loan and lending-related categories, PCI loans are excluded from individual loan product discussions and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm’s consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from year-end primarily reflecting loan paydowns and charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies showed improvement from December 31, 2013. Late stage-delinquencies were flat to December 31, 2013 and continue to be elevated as improvement in the number of loans becoming severely delinquent was offset by higher average carrying values on these delinquent loans, reflecting improving collateral values. Both senior and junior lien nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2013. Net charge-offs for both senior and junior lien home equity loans declined when compared with the same period of the prior year as a result of improvement in home prices and delinquencies.Approximately 15% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consists of home equity loans (“HELOANs”) and the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”). Approximately half of the HELOANs are senior liens and the remainder are junior liens. For further information on the Firm’s home equity portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–129 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The unpaid principal balance of non-PCI HELOCs outstanding was $48 billion at June 30, 2014. Of this balance, approximately $29 billion have recently recast or are scheduled to recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments over the next several years, with $4 billion recasting in 2014 and $7 billion per year scheduled to recast in 2015, 2016, and 2017. However, of the total $29 billion, $2 billion have already recast in 2014 and $11 billion are expected to recast. The remaining $16 billion represents loans to borrowers who are expected either to pre-pay (including borrowers who appear to have the ability to refinance based on the borrower’s LTV ratio and FICO risk score) or charge-off. The Firm has considered this payment recast risk in its allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated amount of payment shock (i.e., the excess of the fully-amortizing payment over the interest-only payment in effect prior to recast) expected to occur at the payment recast date, along with the corresponding estimated

probability of default and loss severity assumptions. Certain factors, such as future developments in both unemployment rates and home prices, could have a significant impact on the performance of these loans.The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile or when the collateral does not support the loan amount. The Firm will continue to evaluate both the near-term and longer-term repricing and recast risks inherent in its HELOC portfolio to ensure that changes in the Firm’s estimate of incurred losses are appropriately considered in the allowance for loan losses and that the Firm’s account management practices are appropriate given the portfolio’s risk profile.High-risk second liens are loans where the borrower has a first mortgage loan that is either delinquent or has been modified. At June 30, 2014, the Firm estimated that its home equity portfolio contained approximately $1.9 billion of current junior lien loans that were considered high risk seconds, compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2013. Such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than junior lien loans for which the senior lien is neither delinquent nor modified. The Firm estimates the balance of its total exposure to high-risk seconds on a quarterly basis using internal data and loan level credit bureau data (which typically provides the delinquency status of the senior lien). The estimated balance of these high-risk seconds may vary from quarter to quarter for reasons such as the movement of related senior liens into and out of the 30+ day delinquency bucket.
Current high risk junior liens(in billions) June 30, 2014December 31, 2013Junior liens subordinate to:     Modified current senior lien  $0.7 $0.9Senior lien 30 – 89 days delinquent  0.6 0.6Senior lien 90 days or more delinquent(a)  0.6 0.8Total current high risk junior liens  $1.9 $2.3
(a)Junior liens subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due are classified as nonaccrual loans. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, excluded approximately $100 million of junior liens that are performing but not current, which were placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with the regulatory guidance.Of the estimated $1.9 billion of high-risk junior liens at June 30, 2014, the Firm owns approximately 10% and services approximately 25% of the related senior lien loans to the same borrowers. The performance of the Firm’s junior lien loans is generally consistent regardless of whether the Firm owns, services or does not own or service the senior lien. The increased probability of default associated with these higher-risk junior lien loans was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.


54



Mortgage: Prime mortgages, including option adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”) and loans held-for-sale, increased as retained originations exceeded paydowns, the run-off of option ARM loans and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Excluding loans insured by U.S. government agencies, both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies showed improvement from December 31, 2013. Nonaccrual loans decreased from the prior year but remain elevated primarily as a result of loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Net charge-offs continued to improve, resulting in a net recovery of losses due to improvement in home prices and delinquencies.At both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm’s prime mortgage portfolio included $14.3 billion of mortgage loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, of which $9.6 billion were, at each such date, 30 days or more past due (of which $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, were 90 days or more past due). The Firm has entered into a settlement regarding loans insured under federal mortgage insurance programs overseen by the FHA, HUD, and VA; the Firm will continue to monitor exposure on future claim payments for government insured loans, but any financial impact related to exposure on future claims is not expected to be significant and was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses. For further discussion of the settlement, see Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm’s prime mortgage portfolio included $15.9 billion and $15.6 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans, which represented 17% and 18%, respectively, of the prime mortgage portfolio. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. To date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader prime mortgage portfolio and the Firm’s expectations. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans.Subprime mortgages continued to decrease due to portfolio runoff. Early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have improved from December 31, 2013, but remain at elevated levels. Net charge-offs continued to improve as a result of improvement in home prices and delinquencies.Auto: Auto loans increased slightly during the first half of the year due to new originations, largely offset by paydowns and payoffs. Delinquent and nonaccrual loans improved compared with December 31, 2013. Net charge-offs

increased compared with the same period of the prior year, but are consistent with expectations. The auto loan portfolio reflects a high concentration of prime-quality credits.Business banking: Business banking loans increased compared with December 31, 2013 due to an increase in loan originations. Nonaccrual loans improved compared with December 31, 2013. Net charge-offs increased slightly from the prior year but are consistent with expectations.Student and other: Student and other loans decreased from year end due primarily to the run-off of the student loan portfolio. Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction decreased as the portfolio continues to run off.As of June 30, 2014, approximately 17% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 56% of the portfolio have been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. Substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans are subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment. The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses.

The remaining nonaccretable difference for principal losses was $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(b)Life-to-date (“LTD”) liquidation losses represent both realization of loss upon loan resolution and any principal forgiven upon modification. LTD liquidation losses included $162 million and $53 million of write-offs of prime mortgages at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.

Current estimated LTVs of residential real estate loans
The current estimated average LTV ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, was 72% at June 30, 2014, compared with 75% at December 31, 2013. The following table presents the current estimated LTV ratios for PCI loans, as well as the ratios of the carrying value of the underlying loans to the current estimated collateral value. Because such loans were initially measured at fair value, the ratios of the carrying value to the current estimated collateral value will be lower than the current estimated LTV ratios, which are based on the unpaid principal balances. The estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Current property values are estimated at least quarterly based on home valuation models that utilize nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates; such models incorporate actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available.(b)Represents current estimated combined LTV for junior home equity liens, which considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(c)Net carrying value includes the effect of fair value adjustments that were applied to the consumer PCI portfolio at the date of acquisition and is also net of the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013 of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion for prime mortgage, respectively, $194 million and $494 million for option ARMs, respectively, and $1.8 billion for home equity and $180 million for subprime mortgage for both periods.The current estimated average LTV ratios were 80% and 94% for California and Florida PCI loans, respectively, at June 30, 2014, compared with 85% and 103%, respectively, at December 31, 2013. Average LTV ratios have declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices. Although home prices have improved, home prices in most areas of California and Florida are still lower than at  the peak of the housing market; this continues to negatively contribute to current estimated average LTV ratios and the ratio of net carrying value to current estimated collateral value for loans in the PCI portfolio. For further information on current estimated LTVs of residential real estate loans, see Note 13.

Geographic composition of residential real estate loansFor information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s residential real estate loans, see Note 13.Loan modification activities – residential real estate loansFor both the Firm’s on–balance sheet loans and loans serviced for others, approximately 1.6 million mortgage modifications have been offered to borrowers and more than 763,000 have been approved since the beginning of 2009. Of these, approximately 759,000 have achieved permanent modification as of June 30, 2014. Of the remaining modifications offered, 18% are in a trial period or still being reviewed for a modification, while 82% have dropped out of the modification program or otherwise were deemed not eligible for final modification.The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted-average redefault rates of 18% for senior lien home equity, 20% for junior lien home equity, 15% for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 27% for subprime mortgages. The cumulative performance metrics for modifications to the PCI residential real estate portfolio seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 19% for home equity, 16% for prime mortgages, 14% for option ARMs and 30% for subprime mortgages. The favorable performance of the PCI option ARM modifications is the result of a targeted proactive program which fixes the borrower’s payment at the current level. The cumulative redefault rates reflect the performance of modifications completed under both the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”) and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs from October 1, 2009, through June 30, 2014.Certain loans that were modified under HAMP and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs (primarily the Firm’s modification program that was modeled after HAMP) have interest rate reset provisions (“step-rate modifications”). Interest rates on these loans will generally increase beginning in 2014 by 1% per year until the rate reaches a specified cap, typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate loan as of the modification date. The carrying value of non-PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications was $5 billion at June 30, 2014, with $1 billion per year scheduled to experience the initial interest rate increase in 2015 and 2016. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications was $11 billion at June 30, 2014, with $2 billion and $3 billion scheduled to experience the initial interest rate increase in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The impact of these potential interest rate increases is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. The Firm will continue to monitor this risk exposure to ensure that it is appropriately considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses.

The following table presents information as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. For additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae, see Note 15.(c)Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans.(d)As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, nonaccrual loans included $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, see Note 13.

Nonperforming assets
The following table presents information as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.
Nonperforming assets(a)   (in millions)June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Nonaccrual loans(b)   Residential real estate$6,471 $6,864Other consumer599 632Total nonaccrual loans7,070 7,496Assets acquired in loan satisfactions   Real estate owned515 614Other37 41Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions552 655Total nonperforming assets$7,622 $8,151
(a)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, nonperforming assets excluded: (1) mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due; (2) real estate owned insured by U.S. government agencies of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively; and (3) student loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP of $316 million and $428 million, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.(b)Excludes PCI loans that were acquired as part of the Washington Mutual transaction, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. Because the Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are all considered to be performing.Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio totaled $6.5 billion at June 30, 2014, of which 33% were greater than 150 days past due, compared with nonaccrual residential real estate loans of $6.9 billion at December 31, 2013, of which 34% were greater than 150 days past due. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 51% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. Loss mitigation activities and the elongated foreclosure processing timelines are expected to continue to result in elevated levels of nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolios.

Active and suspended foreclosure: At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, not included in real estate owned (“REO”), that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. The Firm also had PCI residential real estate loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, with an unpaid principal balance of $3.8 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

Credit CardTotal credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2013 due to seasonality. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 1.41% at June 30, 2014, from 1.67% at December 31, 2013. For the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the net charge-off rates were 2.88% and 3.31%, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the net charge-off rates were 2.90% and 3.43%, respectively. Charge-offs have improved compared with a year ago as a result of improvement in delinquent loans. The credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned, largely rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S. geographic diversification. For information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s credit card loans, see Note 13. Modifications of credit card loansAt June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had $2.5 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. The decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from December 31, 2013, was attributable to a reduction in new modifications as well as ongoing payments and charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans.Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged-off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income.For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–59 and Note 13.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
The wholesale businesses of the Firm are exposed to credit risk through their underwriting, lending and derivatives activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through their operating services activities, such as cash management and clearing activities. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet; the Firm’s syndicated loan business distributes a significant percentage of originations into the market and is an important component of portfolio management.As of June 30, 2014, wholesale credit exposure (primarily CIB, CB, and AM) continued to experience a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends with low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist  of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, increased by 1% to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2014, from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2013.Below are summaries of the top 25 industry exposures as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

Loans
In the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators, see Note 13.The Firm actively manages its wholesale credit exposure. One way of managing credit risk is through secondary market sales of loans and lending-related commitments. During the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Firm sold $14.1 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, of loans and lending-related commitments. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

Lending-related commitments
JPMorgan Chase uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of these contracts.In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s likely actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments, the Firm has established a “loan-equivalent” amount for each commitment; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor. The loan-equivalent amount of the Firm’s lending-related commitments was $221.5 billion and $218.9 billion as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.
Derivative contracts
In the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. Derivatives enable customers to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit exposure. For further discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 5.The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.

Derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $62.4 billion and $65.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. These amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts, after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $13.2 billion and $14.4 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor.In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid  government-agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative transactions move in the Firm’s favor. As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm held $33.3 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively, of this additional collateral. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements, see Note 5.The following table summarizes the ratings profile by derivative counterparty of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of other liquid securities collateral, for the dates indicated.

As noted above, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements – excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity – was 87% as of June 30, 2014, largely unchanged compared with 86% as of December 31, 2013.Credit derivativesThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker; and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. For a detailed description of credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Credit portfolio management activitiesIncluded in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. For further information on derivatives used in credit portfolio

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT EXPOSURE
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. The Firm is a national leader in community development by providing loans, investments and community development services in communities across the United States.At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm’s CRA loan portfolio was approximately $20 billion and $18 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, 47% and 50%, respectively, of the CRA portfolio  were residential mortgage loans; 30% and 26%, respectively, were commercial real estate loans; 15% and 16%, respectively, were business banking loans; and 8%, for both periods, were other loans. CRA nonaccrual loans were 3% of the Firm’s total nonaccrual loans for both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. As a percentage of the Firm’s net charge-offs, net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were 1% for each of the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, and 1% and 2%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.


ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses covers both the consumer (primarily scored) portfolio and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio. The allowance represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s loan portfolio. Management also determines an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments.For a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 86–88 of this Form 10-Q and Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm, and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of June 30, 2014, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The consumer, excluding credit card, allowance for loan losses reflected a reduction from December 31, 2013, due to the continued improvement in home prices and delinquency trends in the residential real estate portfolio and the run-off of the student loan portfolio. For additional information about delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–59 and Note 13.The credit card allowance for loan losses reflected a reduction from December 31, 2013, primarily due to a reduction in the asset-specific allowance due to increased granularity of impairment estimates for loans modified in TDRs. For additional information about delinquencies in the credit card loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–59 and Note 13.The wholesale allowance was relatively unchanged, reflecting a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends.

Provision for credit losses
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the provision for credit losses was $692 million and $1.5 billion respectively, compared with $47 million and $664 million respectively, from the prior year periods. The consumer provision for the six months ended June 30, 2014 reflected an $804 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses,  compared with a $2.7 billion reduction in the prior year period. The decrease in the consumer allowance for loan loss reduction from the prior year was partially offset by lower charge-offs. The wholesale provision for credit losses reflected a generally favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the potential for adverse changes in the value of the Firm’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, implied volatilities or credit spreads. For a discussion of the Firm’s market risk management organization, risk identification and classification, and tools to measure risk, see Market Risk Management on pages 142–148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. For a discussion of the Firm’s risk monitoring and control and market risk limits, see Limits on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Value-at-riskJPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment consistent with the day-to-day risk decisions made by the lines of business.Since VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential losses, and it is not used to estimate the impact of stressed market conditions or to manage any impact from potential stress events. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. In addition to VaR, the Firm considers other measures such as stress testing to capture and manage its market risk positions. In addition, for certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm uses alternative methods to capture and measure those risk parameters that are not otherwise captured in VaR, including economic-value stress testing, nonstatistical measures and risk identification for large exposures. For further information, see Market Risk Management on page 147 of the 2013 Annual Report.The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and other factors. Such changes will also affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Model changes go through a review and approval process by the Model Review Group prior to implementation into the operating environment. For further information, see Model risk on page 153 of the 2013 Annual Report.The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a stable measure of VaR that closely aligns to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business and provides information to respond to risk events on a daily basis. The Firm also calculates a daily Regulatory VaR which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. For further information regarding the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR, see page 146 of the 2013 Annual Report. For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g. VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting), see JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm), and Capital Management on pages 74–80 of this Form 10-Q and pages 160–167 of the 2013 Annual Report.The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

(a)Average portfolio VaR and period-end portfolio VaR were less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.(b)Designated as not meaningful (“NM”), because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, and hence it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio-diversification effect. (c)These amounts have been updated from those included in the June 30, 2014 earnings supplement.As presented in the table above, average Total VaR increased for the three months ended June 30, 2014, when compared with the respective 2013 period. The increase was due to a change in the Mortgage Servicing Rights hedge position in Mortgage Banking in advance of an anticipated update to certain MSR model assumptions. When such updates were implemented late in the second quarter, the MSR VaR decreased to prior levels. MSR model assumptions are continuously evaluated and periodically updated to reflect recent market behavior.The average Total VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2014 decreased from the respective 2013 period. The decrease was primarily driven by the risk reduction of the synthetic credit portfolio and lower volatility in the historical one-year look-back period.The Firm’s average Total VaR diversification benefit was $8 million or 13% of the sum for the three months ended June 30, 2014, compared with $10 million or 18% of the sum for the comparable 2013 period. In general, over the course of the year, VaR exposure can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change. VaR back-testing The Firm evaluates the effectiveness of its VaR methodology by back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses recognized on market-risk related revenue.Effective during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Firm revised its definition of market risk-related gains and losses to be consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: profits and losses on the Firm’s Risk Management positions, excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments (e.g., liquidity and DVA), net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading.The following chart compares the daily market risk-related gains and losses on the Firm’s Risk Management positions during the six months ended June 30, 2014, under the revised definition. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to covered positions. The chart shows that for the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Firm observed no VaR band breaks and posted gains on 89 of the 127 days in this period. The Firm observed no VaR band breaks and posted gains on 42 of the 64 days in the second quarter of 2014.

Earnings-at-riskThe VaR and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt.The Firm conducts simulations of changes in structural interest rate-sensitive revenue under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this revenue, and the corresponding impact to the Firm’s pretax core net interest income, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios highlight exposures to changes in interest rates, pricing sensitivities on deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on current interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors.

(a)Downward 100- and 200-basis-points parallel shocks result in a federal funds target rate of zero and negative three- and six-month treasury rates. The earnings-at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful.The Firm’s benefit to rising rates is largely a result of reinvesting at higher yields and assets re-pricing at a faster pace than deposits.Additionally, another interest rate scenario used by the Firm — involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels — results in a 12-month pretax core net interest income benefit of $530 million. The increase in core net interest income under this scenario reflects the Firm reinvesting at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
Country risk is the risk that a sovereign event or action alters the value or terms of contractual obligations of obligors, counterparties and issuers, or adversely impacts markets related to a country. The Firm has a comprehensive country risk management framework for assessing country risks, determining risk tolerance, and measuring and monitoring direct country exposures in the Firm. The Country Risk Management group is responsible for developing guidelines and policy for managing country risk in both emerging and developed countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios giving rise to country risk with an objective of ensuring the Firm’s country risk exposures are diversified and that exposure levels are appropriate given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.For a discussion of the Firm’s Country Risk Management organization, and country risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control, see pages 149–152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.). The selection of countries is based solely on the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions.

The Firm is also focused on the economic impact of events to Russia’s financial condition, possible potential for contagion effects, including the risk of disruptions in the natural gas markets, and the impact that any potential sovereign downgrades or credit deterioration would have on the Firm’s credit portfolio, the allowance for loan losses and overall risk exposures.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, including human errors, or due to external events that are neither market- nor credit- related. Operational Risk is inherent in each of the Firm’s businesses and Corporate functions, and it can manifest itself in various ways including errors, fraudulent acts, business interruptions, and inappropriate behavior of employees or vendors. These events could result in financial losses, including litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Firm, including reputational harm. To monitor and control operational risk, the Firm maintains an overall framework that includes oversight and governance, risk self-assessment, capital measurement, and reporting and monitoring. Risk management is responsible for prescribing this framework for the lines of business and Corporate functions, whose activities give rise to operational risk, which is intended to enable the Firm to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. For a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Operational Risk Management, see pages 155–157 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.
Operational Risk Capital Measurement
The Firm’s capital methodology incorporates four required elements of the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”): •Internal losses, •External losses, •Scenario analysis, and •Business environment and internal control factors (“BEICF”). The primary component of the operating risk capital estimate is the result of a statistical model, the Loss Data Approach (“LDA”), which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational loss distribution over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level, based on historical internal and external operational loss data in a manner that aligns with the Firm’s LOB structure and the “Basel Event Type” risk categorization. The LDA model incorporates actual operational losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses irrespective of whether the issues or business activity giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced. The LDA is supplemented by both management’s view of plausible tail risk, which is captured as part of the Scenario Analysis process, and evaluation of key LOB internal control metrics (BEICF). The Firm may further supplement such analysis to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its bank regulators.For information related to operational risk RWA, see Regulatory capital on pages 74–78.

CybersecurityThe Firm devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Firm and several other U.S. financial institutions continue to experience significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced unauthorized parties which are intended to disrupt online banking services. The Firm is also regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has also experienced other attempts to breach the security of the Firm’s systems and data which, in certain instances, have resulted in unauthorized access to customer account data. The Firm has established, and continues to establish, defenses on an ongoing basis to mitigate these attacks, and these cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption to the Firm’s operations or material harm to the Firm’s customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on the Firm’s results of operations. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee are regularly apprised regarding the cybersecurity policies and practices of the Firm as well as of significant cybersecurity events.Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients.The Firm is working with appropriate government agencies and other businesses, including the Firm’s third-party service providers, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s capital management highlights developments since December 31, 2013, and should be read in conjunction with the Capital Management section at pages 63-70 and 160–167 of JPMorgan Chase’s first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q and 2013 Annual Report, respectively.A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy and competitive position. The Firm’s capital strategy focuses on long-term stability, which enables the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment.In its capital management, the Firm uses three primary disciplines, which are further described below:

•Regulatory capital
•Economic risk capital
•Line of business equity
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A.The U.S. capital requirements follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Firm and its banking subsidiaries were subject to the capital requirements of Basel I and Basel 2.5. Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm became subject to Basel III which incorporates Basel 2.5.
Basel III overview
Basel III, for U.S. bank holding companies and banks, revises, among other things, the definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1 capital”) requirement; presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), a general (Standardized) approach, which replaces Basel I RWA (“Basel III Standardized”) and an advanced approach, which replaces Basel II RWA(“Basel III Advanced”); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain of the requirements of Basel III are subject to phase-in periods commencing January 1, 2014 through the end of 2018 (“Transitional period”) as described below. For large and internationally active banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, both Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced became effective commencing January 1, 2014.Prior to the implementation of Basel III Advanced, the Firm was required to complete a qualification period (“parallel run”) during which it needed to demonstrate that it met the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of its U.S. banking regulators. On February 21, 2014, the Federal

Reserve and the OCC informed the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries that they had satisfactorily completed the parallel run requirements and were approved to calculate capital under Basel III Advanced, in addition to Basel III Standardized, as of April 1, 2014. In conjunction with its exit from the parallel run, the capital adequacy of the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) which results, for each quarter beginning with the second quarter of 2014, in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”), as required by the Collins Amendment of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).Definition of capitalBasel III revises Basel I and II by narrowing the definition of capital and increasing the capital requirements for specific exposures. Under Basel III, CET1 capital predominantly includes common stockholders’ equity (including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS as well as for defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit (“OPEB”) plans), less certain deductions for goodwill, MSRs and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. The revisions to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in periods commencing January 1, 2014, through the end of 2018, and during that period, CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital represent Basel III Transitional capital.Risk-weighted assets Basel III establishes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA, a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach. Key differences in the calculation of RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches include: (1) for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary only by counterparty type and asset class; and (2) Basel III Advanced includes RWA for operational risk, whereas Basel III Standardized does not. In addition to the RWA calculated under these methodologies, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its bank regulators.Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”)Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate a SLR. For additional information on SLR, see page 78.

Capital ratios
The basis to calculate the Firm’s capital ratios (both risk-based and leverage) under Basel III during the transitional period and when fully phased-in are shown in the table below.
Transitional period Fully Phased-In  2Q14 – 4Q14 2015 – 20172018 2019+        Capital (Numerator) Basel III Transitional Capital(b) Basel III Capital

(a)Beginning in 2015, the Firm will report its SLR to its regulators under an observation period. Beginning in 2018, the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its SLR.(b)Trust preferred securities (“TruPS”) are to be phased out from inclusion in Basel III Capital commencing January 1, 2014, through the end of 2021.(c)Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio and SLR, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, less deductions for disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets, investments in certain subsidiaries, and the total adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments that are subject to deductions from Tier 1 capital.Risk-based capital regulatory minimumsThe Basel III rules include minimum capital ratio requirements that are also subject to phase-in periods and will become fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.In addition to the regulatory minimum capital requirements, global systemically important banks (“GSIBs”) will be required to maintain additional amounts of capital ranging from 1% to 2.5% across all tiers of regulatory capital. In November 2013, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) indicated that certain GSIBs, including the Firm, would be required to hold the additional 2.5% of capital; the requirement will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2016. The Basel Committee has stated that GSIBs could in the future be required to hold 3.5% or more of additional capital if their relative systemic importance were to increase. Currently, no GSIB is required to hold more than the additional 2.5% of capital; however, there is no assurance that the Firm, or one or more of the other GSIBs, will not be required to hold more than the additional 2.5% of capital in the future.Further, certain banking organizations, including the Firm, will be required to hold an additional 2.5% of CET1 capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer.” The capital conservation buffer is intended to be used to absorb potential losses in times of financial or economic stress; if not maintained, the Firm could be limited in the amount of capital that may be distributed, including dividends and common equity repurchases. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2016.Consequently, beginning January 1, 2019, the effective minimum Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirement for the Firm is expected to be 9.5%, comprised of the minimum ratio of 4.5% plus the 2.5% GSIB requirement and the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. Basel III also establishes a minimum 6.5% Tier I common equity standard for the definition of “well capitalized” under the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”). The Tier I common equity standard is effective beginning with the first quarter of 2015.Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-InBasel III capital rules will become fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, at which point the Firm will continue to calculate its capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches, and the Firm will continue to have its capital adequacy evaluated against the approach that results in the lower ratio. The Firm is currently managing each of its lines of business (including line of business equity allocations), as well as its Corporate functions, on a Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In basis.Currently the Firm’s capital, RWA and capital ratios that are presented under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In (and CET1 under Basel I as of December 31, 2013), are non-GAAP financial measures. However, such measures are used by bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the Firm’s capital position and to compare the Firm’s capital to that of other financial services companies.The Firm’s estimates of its Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital, RWA and capital ratios and of the Firm’s, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s, and Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s SLRs reflect management’s current understanding of the U.S. Basel III rules based on the current published rules and on the application of such rules to the Firm’s businesses as currently conducted. The actual impact on the Firm’s capital ratios and SLR as of the effective date of the rules may differ from the Firm’s current estimates depending on changes the Firm may make to its businesses in the future, further implementation guidance from the regulators, and



75


regulatory approval of certain of the Firm’s internal risk models (or, alternatively, regulatory disapproval of the Firm’s internal risk models that have previously been conditionally approved).

For further information on the Firm’s Basel III measures and additional market risk disclosures, see the Firm’s consolidated Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm).
Supplementary leverage ratio
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate a SLR. The SLR, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.The U.S. banking agencies have issued proposed rulemaking relating to the SLR that would require U.S. bank holding companies, including the Firm, to have a minimum SLR of at least 5% and IDIs, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., to have a minimum SLR of at least 6%. The SLR for the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries will become effective beginning on January 1, 2018. On

January 12, 2014, the Basel Committee issued a revised framework for the calculation of the denominator of the SLR. On April 8, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators issued an Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”) for calculating the SLR. The Firm expects the Basel Committee’s revisions to be adopted by the U.S. banking agencies prior to the effective date of the SLR.The Firm estimates, based on its current understanding of the U.S. rules, including the NPR, and the revised Basel framework, that if the rules were in effect at June 30, 2014, the Firm’s SLR would have been approximately 5.4% and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s and Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s SLRs would have been approximately 5.6% and 8.2%, respectively, at that date.Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve uses the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act stress test processes to ensure that large bank holding companies have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each bank holding company’s unique risks to enable them to have the ability to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through the CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each bank holding company’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes, as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases.For the 2014 CCAR process, the Federal Reserve introduced, in addition to the Basel I CET1 capital standards, a Basel III CET1 capital regulatory minimum of 4% for 2014 projections and 4.5% for 2015 projections.On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2014 capital plan. For information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 2014 CCAR results, see Capital Actions on pages 79-80.Regulatory capital outlookThe Firm’s capital targets and minimums are calibrated to the U.S. Basel III requirements. The Firm’s key Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In target ratios are 10%+ for the CET1 capital ratio and 11%+ for the Tier 1 capital ratio, both targeted to be reached by the end of 2014, and a long-term target of 10-10.5% for the CET1 capital ratio. Additionally, management has established a long-term target ratio for the Firm’s SLR of 5.5%+/- and for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s SLR of 6%+. These target levels will enable the Firm to retain market access, continue the Firm’s strategy to invest in and grow its businesses and maintain flexibility to distribute excess capital. The Firm intends to manage its capital so that it achieves the required capital levels and composition in line with, or ahead of, required timetables.


78



Economic risk capital
Economic risk capital is another of the disciplines the Firm uses to assess the capital required to support its businesses. Economic risk capital is a measure of the capital needed to cover JPMorgan Chase’s business activities in the event of unexpected losses. The Firm measures economic risk capital using internal risk-assessment methodologies and models based primarily on four risk factors: credit, market, operational and private equity risk and considers factors, assumptions and inputs that differ from those required to be used for regulatory capital requirements. Accordingly, economic risk capital provides a complementary measure to regulatory capital. As economic risk capital is a separate component of the capital framework for Advanced Approach banking organizations under Basel III, the Firm is in the process of enhancing its economic risk capital framework.

Line of business equity
Equity for a line of business represents the amount the Firm believes the business would require if it were operating independently, considering capital levels for similarly rated peers, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In) and economic risk measures. Capital is also allocated to each line of business for, among other things, goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.

Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm revised the capital allocated to certain businesses and will continue to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments. Further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Capital actionsDividendsThe Firm’s common stock dividend policy reflects JPMorgan Chase’s earnings outlook, desired dividend payout ratio, capital objectives, and alternative investment opportunities.The Firm’s current expectation is to continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 30% of normalized earnings over time. Following the Federal Reserve’s release of the 2014 CCAR results, on May 20, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.40 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July 31, 2014, to stockholders of record on July 3, 2014.At June 30, 2014, the Firm had outstanding 59.8 million warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Firm. The warrants are exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time until October 28, 2018. The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant and the exercise price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the extent regular quarterly cash dividends exceed $0.38 per share. On July 1, 2014, the Firm announced, in accordance with the terms of the warrants, the warrant exercise price was reduced from $42.42 to $42.405 per share effective as of the close of business on July 3, 2014. This adjustment resulted from the aforementioned dividend increase to $0.40 per share on the outstanding shares of the Firm’s common stock. This dividend increase did not result in a change in the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant.For information regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22 and Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Preferred stockDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Firm issued $3.4 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of noncumulative preferred stock. Preferred stock dividends declared were $268 million and $495 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively. Assuming all preferred stock issuances were outstanding for the entire period and quarterly dividends were declared on such issuances, preferred stock dividends would have been $300 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. For additional information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q.Common equityOn March 13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. The amount of equity that


79


may be repurchased by the Firm is also subject to the amount that is set forth in the Firm’s annual capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process. In conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s release of its 2014 CCAR results, the Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized the Firm to repurchase $6.5 billion of common equity between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2014, $5.0 billion (on a trade-date basis) of such repurchase capacity remains. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity-based compensation plans.The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, on a trade-date basis. As of June 30, 2014, $6.8 billion (on a trade-date basis) of authorized capacity remained under the $15.0 billion repurchase program. There were no warrants repurchased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading “black-out periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information.The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities, see Part II, Item 5: Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities on pages 20–21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Form 10-K.



Broker-dealer regulatory capitalJPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“JPMorgan Securities”) and J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. (“JPMorgan Clearing”). JPMorgan Clearing is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Securities and provides clearing and settlement services. JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are each subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are also each registered as futures commission merchants and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing have elected to compute their minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital Rule. At June 30, 2014, JPMorgan Securities’ net capital, as defined by the Net Capital Rule, was $13.6 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $11.4 billion, and JPMorgan Clearing’s net capital was $8.0 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $6.0 billion.In addition to its minimum net capital requirement, JPMorgan Securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in the event that tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion, in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. As of June 30, 2014, JPMorgan Securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and is the Firm’s principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. It has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). Commencing January 1, 2014, J.P. Morgan Securities plc became subject to the U.K. Basel III capital rules. At June 30, 2014, J.P. Morgan Securities plc had estimated total capital of $27.6 billion and its estimated CET1 capital ratio of 8.2% and estimated Total capital ratio of 11.2% both exceeded the minimum standards applicable under European Union (“EU”)/U.K. Basel III capital rules (5.1% and 9.1%, respectively), including all required add-ons applied by the U.K. PRA.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk management is intended to ensure that the Firm has the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity in support of its assets. The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to ensure that the Firm’s core businesses are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent obligations through normal economic cycles, as well as during market stress events, and to maintain debt ratings that enable the Firm to optimize its funding mix and liquidity sources while minimizing costs. The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Liquidity Risk Management should be read in conjunction with pages 168–173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Management considers the Firm’s liquidity position to be strong as of June 30, 2014, and believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.LCR and NSFRIn December 2010, the Basel Committee introduced two new measures of liquidity risk: the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), which is intended to measure the amount of “high-quality liquid assets” (“HQLA”) held by the Firm in relation to estimated net cash outflows within a 30-day period during an acute stress event; and the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), which is intended to measure the “available” amount of stable funding relative to the “required” amount of stable funding over a one-year horizon. The standards require that the LCR be no lower than 100% and the NSFR be greater than 100%.In January 2013, the Basel Committee introduced certain amendments to the formulation of the LCR, and a revised timetable to phase in the standard. The LCR will become effective on January 1, 2015, but the minimum requirement will begin at 60%, increasing in equal annual increments to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. At June 30, 2014, the Firm was compliant with the fully phased-in Basel III LCR standard.On October 24, 2013, the U.S. banking regulators released a proposal to implement a U.S. quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with, but more conservative than, Basel III LCR for large banks and bank holding companies(“U.S. LCR”). The proposal also provides for an accelerated transition period compared with current requirements under the Basel III LCR rules. At June 30, 2014, the Firm was also compliant with the fully phased-in U.S. LCR based on its current understanding of the proposed rules. The Firm’s LCR may fluctuate from period-to-period due to normal flows from client activity.FundingSources of fundsThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding, including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm’s loan portfolio, aggregating approximately $747.0 billion at June 30, 2014, is funded with a portion of the Firm’s deposits aggregating approximately $1,319.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and through securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm’s real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks. Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Capital markets secured financing assets and trading assets are primarily funded by the Firm’s capital markets secured financing liabilities, trading liabilities and a portion of the Firm’s long-term debt and equity.In addition to funding capital markets assets, proceeds from the Firm’s debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans, and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. See the discussion below for additional disclosures relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance.DepositsA key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. The Firm’s loans-to-deposits ratio was 57% at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.As of June 30, 2014, total deposits for the Firm were $1,319.8 billion, compared with $1,287.8 billion at December 31, 2013 (58% of total liabilities at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013). The increase was attributable to both higher consumer and wholesale deposits. For further information, see Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 13–14.The Firm typically experiences higher customer deposit inflows at period-ends. Therefore, the Firm believes average deposit balances are more representative of deposit trends. The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposits balance as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, as well as average deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits (37% and 36% at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively), which are considered more stable as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes or market volatility. Additionally, the majority of the Firm’s wholesale deposits are also considered to be stable sources of funding since they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. For further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of the results for the Firm’s business segments and the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 19–49 and pages 13–14, respectively.The following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, and average balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Short-term fundingA significant portion of the Firm’s total commercial paper liabilities, approximately 71% as of June 30, 2014, are not sourced from wholesale funding markets, but were originated from deposits that customers choose to sweep into commercial paper liabilities as a cash management program offered to customers of the Firm.The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt, agency debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under purchase agreements. The amount of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at June 30, 2014, compared with the balance at December 31, 2013, increased due to higher financing of the Firm’s trading assets-debt and equity instruments as well as investment securities portfolio, and a change in the mix of the Firm’s funding sources. The decrease in average balances for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2014, compared with June 30, 2013, was primarily driven by lower trading assets-debt and equity instruments funding through secured financing activities, and a change in the mix of the Firm’s funding sources. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities; the Firm’s demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors.Long-term funding and issuanceLong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven by expected client activity and the liquidity required to support this activity. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding cost, as well as maintaining a certain level of pre-funding at the parent holding company. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.The majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the parent holding company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. For additional information, see Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and advances from the FHLBs. It may also in the future raise long-term funding through securitization of residential mortgages, auto loans and student loans, which would increase funding and investor diversity.

(a)Other securitizations includes securitizations of residential mortgages and student loans.
Subsequent to June 30, 2014, the Firm securitized $500 million of consumer credit card loans.The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Parent holding company and subsidiary fundingThe parent holding company acts as an important source of funding to its subsidiaries. The Firm’s liquidity management is intended to ensure that liquidity at the parent holding company is maintained at levels sufficient to fund the operations of the parent holding company and its subsidiaries for an extended period of time in a stress environment where access to normal funding sources is disrupted.To effectively monitor the adequacy of liquidity and funding at the parent holding company, the Firm targets pre-funding of the parent holding company to ensure that both contractual and non-contractual obligations can be met for at least 18 months assuming no access to wholesale funding markets. However, due to conservative liquidity management actions taken by the Firm, the current pre-funding of such obligations is greater than target. For further discussion on liquidity at the parent holding company see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 168–173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.HQLAHQLA is the estimated amount of assets that qualify for inclusion in the Basel III LCR. HQLA primarily consists of cash and certain unencumbered high quality liquid assets as defined in the rule.As of June 30, 2014, HQLA was estimated to be approximately $576 billion, compared with $522 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase in HQLA was due to higher cash balances primarily driven by higher deposit balances, increased securities sold under repurchase agreements and preferred stock issuance, partially offset by higher loan balances. HQLA may fluctuate from period-to-period primarily due to normal flows from client activity.

The following table presents the estimated HQLA included in the Basel III LCR broken out by HQLA-eligible cash and HQLA-eligible securities as of June 30, 2014.
(in billions)June 30, 2014HQLA(a) Eligible cash(b)$348Eligible securities(c)228Total HQLA$576
(a)HQLA under the proposed U.S. LCR is estimated to be lower than the total HQLA shown in this table primarily due to exclusions of certain security types, based on the Firm’s understanding of the proposed rule.(b)Primarily cash on deposit at central banks.(c)Primarily includes U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries, sovereign bonds and other government-guaranteed or government-sponsored securities.In addition to HQLA, as of June 30, 2014, the Firm had approximately $262 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. Furthermore, the Firm maintains borrowing capacity at various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. As of June 30, 2014, the Firm’s remaining borrowing capacity at various FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window was approximately $145 billion. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities included in HQLA or other unencumbered securities held at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for which the Firm has not drawn liquidity.
Stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Firm under a variety of adverse scenarios. Results of stress tests are therefore considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. For additional information on liquidity stress tests see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 168–173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.


84


Contingency funding planThe Firm’s contingency funding plan (“CFP”), which is reviewed and approved by the Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”), provides a documented framework for managing both temporary and longer-term unexpected adverse liquidity stress. The CFP incorporates the limits and indicators set by the Liquidity Risk Oversight group. These limits and indicators are reviewed regularly to identify emerging risks or increased vulnerabilities in the Firm’s liquidity position. The CFP is also regularly updated to identify alternative contingent liquidity resources that can be accessed under adverse liquidity circumstances. Credit ratingsThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see Special-purpose entities on page 15, and Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5.The credit ratings of the parent holding company and certain of the Firm’s significant operating subsidiaries as of June 30, 2014, were as follows.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.Chase Bank USA, N.A. J.P.

Downgrades of the Firm’s long-term ratings by one or two notches could result in a downgrade of the Firm’s short-term ratings. If this were to occur, the Firm believes its cost of funds could increase and access to certain funding markets could be reduced. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors (which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics). The Firm believes it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. For example, S&P has announced that it may change its ratings methodology for hybrid capital securities (including preferred stock), and Fitch has announced a review of the ratings differential that it applies between bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely monitors and endeavors to manage factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that its credit ratings will not be changed in the future.


SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
For further information on Supervision and Regulation, see the Supervision and regulation section on pages 1–9 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Form 10-K. DividendsAt June 30, 2014, JPMorgan Chase estimated that its banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $39 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period-to-period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgment.

Allowance for credit losses
JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying values of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. For further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for credit losses on pages 139–141 and Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report; for amounts recorded as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, see Allowance for credit losses on pages 66–68 and Note 14 of this Form 10-Q.As noted in the discussion on pages 174–176 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. For example, deterioration in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled loss estimates as of June 30, 2014, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses:•For PCI loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 1% increase in unemployment from current levels could imply an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1.0 billion.•For the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a

1% increase in unemployment from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual loss estimates of approximately $150 million.•A 50 basis point deterioration in forecasted credit card loss rates could imply an increase to modeled annualized credit card loan loss estimates of approximately $600 million.•A one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled loss estimates of approximately $2.0 billion.The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then current circumstances and conditions.It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions would affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loans and credit card loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit loss is appropriate.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs — including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. For further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, see Note 3.For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s credit-worthiness, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the

level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole.Effective the fourth quarter of 2013, the Firm applies an FVA framework to incorporate the impact of funding into its valuation estimates for OTC derivatives and structured notes, reflecting an industry migration towards incorporating the market cost of unsecured funding in the valuation of such instruments. Implementation of the FVA framework required a number of important management judgments including: (i) determining when the accumulation of market evidence was sufficiently compelling to implement the FVA framework; (ii) estimating the market clearing price for funding in the relevant market; and (iii) determining the interaction between DVA and FVA, given that DVA already reflects credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding spreads that drive FVA. For further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm, including FVA, see Note 3.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3.Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, see Goodwill impairment on pages 177–178 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuation of its Mortgage Banking business in CCB, which continues to have an elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. economic conditions and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes. As of June 30, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Firm’s Mortgage Banking business in CCB did not exceed its carrying value; however, the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to the Mortgage Banking business exceeded its carrying value of approximately $2 billion.The Firm also updated the discounted cash flow valuation of its Private Equity business, based on the anticipated future decline in portfolio balances and business activity. As of June 30, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Firm’s Private Equity business exceeded its carrying value; however, the goodwill balance associated with this business


87


is anticipated to decline or could become impaired in future periods.For its other businesses, the Firm reviewed current conditions (including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes and current estimated market cost of equity) and prior projections of business performance. Based upon the updated valuation of its Private Equity and Mortgage Banking businesses and reviews of its other businesses, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to all of its reporting units was not impaired at June 30, 2014.Deterioration in economic market conditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, or additional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected business performance beyond management’s current expectations. For example, in the Firm’s Mortgage Banking business, such declines could result from increases in primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, higher costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters or from deterioration in economic conditions, including decreases in home prices  that result in increased credit losses. Declines in business performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.For additional information on goodwill, see Note 16.Income taxesFor a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes, see Income taxes on page 178 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Litigation reservesFor a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, see Note 23 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.



ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS
Repurchase agreements and similar transactionsIn June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for certain secured financing transactions, and requires enhanced disclosures with respect to transactions recognized as sales in which exposure to the derecognized asset is retained through a separate agreement with the counterparty. In addition, the guidance requires enhanced disclosures with respect to the types and quality of financial assets pledged in secured financing transactions. The guidance will become effective in the first quarter of 2015, except for the disclosures regarding the types and quality of financial assets pledged, which will become effective in the second quarter of 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or its results of operations.Revenue Recognition – Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB issued revenue recognition guidance that is intended to create greater consistency with respect to how and when revenue from contracts with customers is shown in the income statement. The guidance requires that revenue from contracts with customers be recognized upon delivery of a good or service based on the amount of consideration expected to be received, and requires additional disclosures about revenue. The guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2017 and early adoption is prohibited. The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entityIn April 2014, the FASB issued guidance that changes the criteria for determining whether a disposition qualifies for discontinued operations presentation and requires enhanced disclosures about discontinued operations and significant dispositions that do not qualify to be presented as discontinued operations. The guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2015, with early adoption permitted but only for dispositions or assets held-for-sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Investments in qualified affordable housing projectsIn January 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The guidance replaces the effective yield method and allows companies to make an accounting policy election to amortize the cost of its investments in proportion to the tax benefits received if certain criteria are met, and to present the amortization as a component of income tax expense. The guidance will become effective in the first quarter of 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of presentationJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, see Note 24.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2013 Annual Report”).Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the balance sheet when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, see Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Consolidated statements of cash flowsDuring the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from available-for-sale (“AFS”) to held-to-maturity (“HTM”). This transfer was a non-cash transaction. For additional information regarding this transaction, see Note 11.Note 2 – Business changes and developments Business eventsRegulatory UpdateComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2014 capital plan.Basel IIIEffective January 1, 2014, the Firm became subject to Basel III. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Firm and its banking subsidiaries were subject to the capital requirements of Basel I and Basel 2.5. Additionally, the Firm is approved to calculate capital under the Basel III Advanced Approach, in addition to the Basel III Standardized Approach effective April 1, 2014.For further information on the implementation of Basel III, refer to Note 20.Preferred stock issuancesDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Firm issued $3.4 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock. For further information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Physical commodities businessesThe Firm continues to execute a business simplification agenda that will allow it to focus on core activities for its core clients and better manage its operational, regulatory, and litigation risks. On March 19, 2014, the Firm announced that it had agreed to sell certain of its physical commodities operations, including its physical oil, gas, power, warehousing facilities and energy transportation operations, to Mercuria Energy Group Limited. The after-tax impact of this transaction is not expected to be material. The sale is subject to normal regulatory approvals and is expected to close before the end of 2014. The Firm remains fully committed to its traditional banking activities in the commodities markets, including financial derivatives and the trading of precious metals, which are not part of the physical commodities operations sale.Increase in common stock dividendThe Board of Directors increased the Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 per share to $0.40 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July 31, 2014, to shareholders of record on July 3, 2014. Note 3 – Fair value measurementFor a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

(a)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $80.6 billion and $91.5 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included within trading loans were $15.5 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $4.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $6.6 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, market approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, see Note 5. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions) when the long and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”).(e)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Therefore, the balances reported in the fair value hierarchy table are gross of any counterparty netting adjustments. However, if the Firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivables and payables balances would be $4.2 billion and $7.6 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.(f)Private equity instruments represent investments within the Corporate/Private Equity line of business. The cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $6.3 billion and $8.0 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(g)Includes investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds that do not have readily determinable fair values. The Firm uses net asset value per share when measuring the fair value of these investments. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the fair values of these investments were $2.2 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, of which $590 million and $899 million, respectively, were classified in level 2, and $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in level 3.Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basisFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2, or from level 2 into level 3.During the three months ended June 30, 2014, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion of equity derivative receivables and payables, respectively, due to increased observability of certain equity options.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, certain highly rated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), including $27.3 billion held in the Firm’s AFS securities portfolio and $1.3 billion held in the trading portfolio, were transferred from level 3 to level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency.All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.Level 3 valuationsFor further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input range does not reflect the level of input uncertainty; instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at June 30, 2014, the equity and interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range presented. In addition, the interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while equity volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range. The forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated within the lower end of the range presented.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.(b)The unobservable inputs and associated input ranges for approximately $389 million of credit derivative receivables and $342 million of credit derivative payables with underlying commercial mortgage risk have been included in the inputs and ranges provided for commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans.(c)The unobservable inputs and associated input ranges for approximately $1.1 billion of credit derivative receivables and $972 million of credit derivative payables with underlying asset-backed securities risk have been included in the inputs and ranges provided for corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other.(d)Long-term debt, other borrowed funds and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes is predominantly based on the derivative features embedded within the instruments. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(e)The range has not been disclosed due to the wide range of possible values given the diverse nature of the underlying investments.Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated Balance Sheets changes
Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 2.5% of total Firm assets at June 30, 2014. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2013, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 107.
Three months ended June 30, 2014
Level 3 assets were $60.4 billion at June 30, 2014, reflecting a decrease of $2.8 billion from March 31, 2014, largely due to the following:•$4.9 billion decrease in derivative receivables, largely driven by client-driven market-making activity and a transfer of equity derivative receivables from level 3 to level 2 due to increase in observability of certain equity options;•$2.0 billion increase in loans due to originations;•$1.5 billion increase in trading assets - debt and equity instruments largely driven by trading loans purchases and new client-driven financing transactions;
Six months ended June 30, 2014
Level 3 assets decreased by $8.9 billion in the first six months of 2014, mainly due to the following:•$6.0 billion decrease in derivative receivable, predominantly driven by equity derivative receivables due to maturities and a transfer from level 3 to level 2 as a result of increase in observability of certain equity options;•$2.3 billion increase in loans due to originations;•$1.6 billion decrease in private equity investments, driven by sales of investments.•$1.4 billion decrease in trading assets - debt and equity instruments, largely driven by net sales and maturities of corporate debt securities.•$1.3 million decrease in MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16;






Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 99–106.
Three months ended June 30, 2014
•$1.1 billion net losses on derivatives, largely due to client-driven market-making activities in equity derivatives.
Three months ended June 30, 2013
•$1.0 billion of gains on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16.
Six months ended June 30, 2014
•$1.6 billion of net gains in trading assets - debt and equity instruments, largely driven by client-driven activities in corporate debt and trading loans;•$1.4 billion of net losses on derivatives, largely driven by foreign exchange derivatives due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and client-driven market-making activities in equity derivatives.•$1.0 billion of losses on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16.
Six months ended June 30, 2013
•$1.3 billion of gains on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16.•$(905) million of gains on long-term debt, due to market movements.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis At June 30, 2014 and 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $3.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which predominantly consisted of loans that had fair value adjustments in each of the first six months of 2014 and 2013. At June 30, 2014, $597 million and $2.8 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At June 30, 2013, $95 million and $1.5 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at June 30, 2014 and 2013. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $3.4 billion of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $2.1 billion related to trade finance loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale during the fourth quarter of 2013 and subject to a lower of cost or fair value adjustment. These loans were classified as level 3, as they are valued based on the indicative pricing received from external investors, which ranged from a spread of 58 bps to 70 bps, with a weighted average of 62 bps.At June 30, 2014, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis also included $542 million related to residential real estate loans measured at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 12% to 64%, with a weighted average of 29%.The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $318 million and $293 million, respectively; and for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, was a reduction of $456 million and $521 million.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value
The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

(a)Carrying value includes unamortized discount or premium.(b)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see Valuation hierarchy on pages 197–215 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and pages 96–109 of this Note.(c)Current period numbers have been updated to include certain nonmarketable equity securities. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation.(d)Carrying value includes unamortized original issue discount and other valuation adjustments.The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm’s wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a)There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.(b)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected notes. Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflected as the remaining contractual principal is the final principal payment at maturity.At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(106) million and $(99) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report, and Note 21 of this Form 10-Q.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge  accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

(a)Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. See Note 4 for further information.(b)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.The following table presents, as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the gross and net derivative receivables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative payables and cash collateral payables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement.

These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is comprised of  non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.

The following tables present information regarding certain financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the derivative instruments for which appropriate legal opinions have been obtained; excluded are (i) additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and (ii) all collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.

For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty.(b)Derivative payable collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. Amounts exclude collateral transferred related to exchange-traded derivative instruments.(c)Net amount represents exposure of counterparties to the Firm.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresFor a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. The current presentation excludes accrued interest.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to changes in foreign currency rates, were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(c)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(d)The prior period amounts have been revised. This revision had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or its results of operations.(e)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.(f)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time values.

(a)Primarily consists of benchmark interest rate hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.(c)The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.(d)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $71 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) at June 30, 2014, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 9 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

(a)

Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no material ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013
.



Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes
The following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(c)Primarily relates to hedges of the foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(d)Primarily relates to commodity derivatives used to mitigate energy price risk associated with energy-related contracts and investments. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm’s market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.

(a)Prior to the second quarter of 2014, trading revenue was presented by major underlying type of risk exposure, generally determined based upon the business primarily responsible for managing that risk exposure. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. This revision had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.(b)Includes realized gains and losses and unrealized losses on physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value), subject to any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, and gains and losses on commodity derivatives and other financial instruments that are carried at fair value through income. Commodity derivatives are frequently used to manage the Firm’s risk exposure to its physical commodities inventories. For gains/(losses) related to commodity fair value hedges see Note 5.

(c)Includes revenue on private equity investments held in the Private Equity business within Corporate/Private Equity, as well as those held in other business segments.The following table presents the components of firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.

Note 11 – SecuritiesSecurities are classified as AFS, HTM or trading. Securities classified as trading are discussed in Note 3. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM investment securities (the “investment securities portfolio”) are held by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (“CIO”) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax unrealized losses of $9 million on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect the Firm’s intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures under Basel III.

Realized gains and losses
The following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (“OTTI”) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.

Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities
The following table presents a rollforward for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.

Gross unrealized losses
Gross unrealized losses have generally decreased since December 31, 2013. Though losses on securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have increased, the increase is not material. The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of June 30, 2014, the Firm does not intend to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities noted above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities in an unrealized loss position are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2014.

(a)U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were the only issuers whose securities exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2014.(b)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)Includes securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately six years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, three years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and four years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the  fair value option has been elected, see Note 4. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22.The following table presents as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the gross and net securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities borrowed are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm held $14.1 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been  recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets, other assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, and accounts payable and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 13 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans•Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair value•PCI loans held-for-investment

For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. See Note 4 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:
Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(c)Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Home equity – senior lien• Home equity – junior lien• Prime mortgage, including    option ARMs• Subprime mortgageOther consumer loans• Auto(b)• Business banking(b)• Student and otherResidential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other(d)
(a)Includes loans held in CCB, and prime mortgage loans held in the AM business segment and in Corporate/Private Equity.(b)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB and AM business segments and in Corporate/Private Equity. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.(d)Other primarily includes loans to special-purpose entities (“SPEs”) and loans to private banking clients. See Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information on SPEs.The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.

(a)Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Ginnie Mae guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Rural Housing Services (“RHS”) and/or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”).(b)Excluded retained loans purchased from correspondents that were originated in accordance with the Firm’s underwriting standards. Such purchases were $2.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $4.1 billion and $2.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The following table provides information about gains/(losses) on loan sales by portfolio segment.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.

Residential real estate – excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate – excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm’s residential real estate – excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion; 30–149 days past due included $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion; and 150 or more days past due included $6.0 billion and $6.6 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(b)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, Prime, including option ARMs loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.8 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.(c)These balances, which are 90 days or more past due but insured by U.S. government agencies, are excluded from nonaccrual loans. In predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, these balances included $4.3 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest because interest has been curtailed by the U.S. government agencies although, in predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal is still insured. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate.(d)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates.(e)Junior lien represents combined LTV, which considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(f)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(g)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively.The following tables represent the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

(a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual that require interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the collateral does not support the loan amount.Home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (“HELOANs”) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options  available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm’s delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.

Impaired loans
The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14.

(a)Represents collateral-dependent residential mortgage loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status.(b)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, $6.7 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.(c)Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S.(d)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs; and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.(e)As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, nonaccrual loans included $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.

Loan modifications
The Firm is required to provide “borrower relief” under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This “borrower relief” includes reductions of principal and forbearance. For further information on these Consent Orders and settlements, see Business changes and developments in Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There are no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.

Nature and extent of modifications
Making Home Affordable (“MHA”), as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term  or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At June 30, 2014, there were approximately 35,200 of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 8,300 senior lien home equity loans, 21,200 junior lien home equity loans, 2,900 prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 2,800 subprime mortgages.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications. These tables also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.Approximately 85% of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”) program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At June 30, 2014, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months, are 18% for senior lien home equity, 20% for junior lien home equity, 15% for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 27% for subprime mortgages. Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge. Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10% and 40% in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At June 30, 2014, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 18% of senior lien home equity, 11% of junior lien home equity, 28% of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 18% of subprime mortgages that were 30 days or more past due.At June 30, 2014, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6 years for senior lien home equity, 7 years for junior lien home equity, 9 years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8 years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
For auto loans, TDRs typically occur in connection with the bankruptcy of the borrower. In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions.The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $7 million and $11 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $14 million and $23 million during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The balance  of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $11 million and $15 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively and $22 million and $28 million during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.In May 2014 the Firm began extending the deferment period for up to 24 months for certain student loans, which resulted in extending the maturity of the loans at their original contractual interest rates. These modified loans are considered TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status.The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans, excluding student loans, for the periods presented.

(a)Carrying value includes the effect of fair value adjustments that were applied to the consumer PCI portfolio at the date of acquisition.(b)Management concluded as part of the Firm’s regular assessment of the PCI loan pools that it was probable that higher expected credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows. As a result, an allowance for loan losses for impairment of these pools has been recognized.(c)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(d)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.Approximately 20% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth  delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.

(a)Other changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the Firm continues to refine its cash flow model and periodically updates model assumptions. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, and for the three months ended June 30, 2013, other changes in expected cash flows were driven by changes in prepayment assumptions. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, other changes in expected cash flows were due to refining the expected interest cash flows on HELOCs with balloon payments, partially offset by changes in prepayment assumptions.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.

At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, $179 million and $226 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $115 million and $143 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed.(e)Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.

Loan modifications
The Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60 months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were $193 million and $288 million, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were $426 million and $627 million, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

(a)Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 29.17% and 30.72% for credit card loans modified as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating  assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note 14 and Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.

Wholesale impaired loans and loan modifications
Wholesale impaired loans are comprised of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14.

(a)When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged-off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.(b)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs; interest payments received and applied to the carrying value; net deferred loan fees or costs; and unamortized discount or premiums on purchased loans.(c)Based upon the domicile of the borrower, predominantly all wholesale impaired loans are in the U.S.

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. For further information, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table provides information about the Firm’s wholesale loans that have been modified in TDRs, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of such loans and information regarding the nature and extent of modifications during the periods presented.

For the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was zero and 0.9 years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.8 years and 1.4 years, respectively. There were no wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended June 30, 2014. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended June 30, 2013 was $1 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 1.0 years and 2.1 years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.7 years and 1.6 years, respectively. There were no wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the six months ended June 30, 2014. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $1 million. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.

The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 157 of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm’s primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 158 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 159 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities on pages 159–160 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

See Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities on pages 159–160 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.(b)Consists of securities backed by commercial loans (predominantly real estate) and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables purchased from third parties. The Firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.(c)The table above excludes the following: retained servicing (see Note 16 for a discussion of MSRs); securities retained from loans sales to U.S. government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities (See Note 5 for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $105 million and $55 million, respectively, at June 30, 2014, and $151 million and $30 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.(d)Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.(e)As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, 69% of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $437 million and $551 million of investment-grade and $238 million and $260 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion of investment-grade and $124 million and $80 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 158 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. See the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, The Firm transferred $8.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $264 million and zero, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.During the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, The Firm transferred $13.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $433 million and zero, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations.

See the table on page 158 of this Note for more information on consolidated re-securitization transactions. As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm held approximately $2.3 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $37 million and $6 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 155 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $7.4 billion and $4.1 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments were not driven by market liquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity, and credit enhancement provided by the Firm to the multi-seller conduits have been eliminated in consolidation. Unfunded lending-related commitments made to clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits were $9.2 billion and $9.1 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows.

These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated Balance Sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

(a)Excludes re-securitization transactions.(b)For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, $312 million and $642 million of proceeds from residential mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 and zero and $21 million of proceeds classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, $2.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 and $130 million of proceeds classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and $280 million of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitization were received as cash. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, $446 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, of proceeds from residential mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, $3.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and zero and $207 million, respectively, of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as cash. All loans transferred into securitization vehicles during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were classified as trading assets; changes in fair value were recorded in principal transactions revenue, and there were no significant gains or losses associated with the securitization activity.(c)Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from off–balance sheet, nonconsolidated entities – for example, loan repurchases due to representation and warranties and servicer clean-up calls.(d)Includes prime, Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes certain loan securitization transactions entered into with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.(e)Includes commercial and student loan securitizations.

Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying any of the transactions described above as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights.

The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.

Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm may elect to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of June 30, 2014, and

December 31, 2013, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $14.3 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 13 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.




Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses
The table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Goodwill impairment testingFor further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing process, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 299–300 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2014, or December 31, 2013, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.However, the Firm expects that the goodwill associated with its Private Equity business in Corporate will decline or could become impaired in future periods.In addition, the Firm’s Mortgage Banking business in CCB remains at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. economic conditions, such as increases in primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, or decreases in home prices, and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes, including higher costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters. Deterioration in the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test could cause the estimated fair values of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.


161



Mortgage servicing rights
Mortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and Note 3 of this Form 10-Q.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months endedJune 30, 2014 and

2013

The Firm’s credit risk associated with recoverable servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. Servicer advances are recognized net of an allowance for unrecoverable advances.(f)Predominantly represents excess mortgage servicing rights transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired and has retained the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. Also includes sales of MSRs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.(g)For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the decrease was primarily related to higher capital allocated to the Mortgage Servicing business, which, in turn, resulted in an increase in the option adjusted spread (“OAS”). The resulting OAS assumption continues to be consistent with capital and return requirements that the Firm believes a market participant would consider, taking into account factors such as the current operating risk environment and regulatory and economic capital requirements. (h)For the six months ended June 30, 2013, the increase was driven by the inclusion in the MSR valuation model of servicing fees receivable on certain delinquent loans.(i)For the six months ended June 30, 2013, the decrease was driven by changes in the inputs and assumptions used to derive prepayment speeds, primarily increases in home prices.The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

(a)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.(b)Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.
(in millions, except rates)Jun 30, 2014 Dec 31, 2013Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”)8.56% 8.07%Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change$(363) $(362)Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change(704) (705)Weighted-average option adjusted spread9.14% 7.77%Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change$(343) $(389)Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change(660) (750)
CPR: Constant prepayment rate.

The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsThe $279 million decrease in other intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due to amortization.

(a)Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS (due to the antidilutive effect) were options issued under employee benefit plans and the warrants originally issued in 2008 under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program to purchase shares of the Firm’s common stock. The aggregate number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such options and warrants was 1 million and 8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and 1 million and 11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(b)Participating securities were included in the calculation of diluted EPS using the two-class method, as this computation was more dilutive than the calculation using the treasury stock method.

(a)Represents the after-tax difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities accounted for as AFS; including, as of the date of transfer during the first quarter of 2014, $9 million of net unrealized losses related to AFS securities that were transferred to HTM. Subsequent to transfer, includes any net unamortized unrealized gains and losses related to the transferred securities.(b)The net change for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, was primarily due to higher market valuations of obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and U.S. mortgage-backed securities in the Firm’s AFS investment securities portfolio.(c)The net change for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, was primarily related to the decline in fair value of U.S. government agency issued MBS and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities due to market changes, as well as net realized gains.The following table presents the pretax and after-tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss).

Note 20 – Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Basel III rules under the transitional Standardized and Advanced Approaches (“Basel III Standardized Transitional” and “Basel III Advanced Transitional,” respectively) became effective on January 1, 2014; all prior period data is based on Basel I rules. For 2014, Basel III Standardized Transitional requires the Firm to calculate its capital ratios using the Basel III definition of capital divided by the Basel I definition of RWA, inclusive of Basel 2.5 for market risk. On February 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve and the OCC informed the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries that they were approved to calculate capital under Basel III Advanced, in addition to Basel III Standardized, as of April 1, 2014. As of January 1, 2014, there are three categories of risk-based capital: Common Equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1 capital”) under the Basel III Transitional rules, as well asTier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common stockholders’ equity (including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS as well as for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans), less certain deductions for goodwill, MSRs and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Basel III establishes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA, a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach. Key differences in the calculation of RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches include: (1) for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary only by counterparty type and asset class; and (2) Basel III Advanced includes RWA for operational risk, whereas Basel III Standardized does not. As a result of becoming subject to Basel III Advanced on April 1, 2014, the capital adequacy of the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries will be evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) that results, for each quarter beginning with the second quarter of 2014, in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”), as required by the Collins Amendment of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).

The following tables present the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking subsidiaries under both Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional at June 30, 2014, and under Basel I at December 31, 2013.

(a)At June 30, 2014, trust preferred securities included in Basel III Tier 1 capital were $2.7 billion and $300 million for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., respectively. At June 30, 2014, Chase Bank USA, N.A. had no trust preferred securities.(b)Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio, include total quarterly average assets adjusted for unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, less deductions for disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets, investments in certain subsidiaries, and the total adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments that are subject to deductions from Tier 1 capital.(c)Beginning April 1, 2014, the lower ratio represents the Collins Floor.(d)Asset and capital amounts for JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries reflect intercompany transactions; whereas the respective amounts for JPMorgan Chase reflect the elimination of intercompany transactions.Note:Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both non-taxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from non-taxable business combinations totaling $145 million and $192 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $2.8 billion at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.



Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. Bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table presents the minimum ratios to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject as of June 30, 2014.

In addition to the 2014 well-capitalized standards, beginning January 1, 2015, Basel III Transitional CET1 capital and the Basel III Standardized Transitional and the Basel III Advanced Transitional CET1 capital ratios become relevant capital measures under the prompt corrective action requirements defined by the regulations.As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

Note 21 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale lending commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. Also, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.(d)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included credit enhancements and bond and commercial paper liquidity commitments to U.S. states and municipalities, hospitals and other non-profit entities of $17.0 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, within other unfunded commitments to extend credit; and $15.2 billion and $17.2 billion, respectively, within standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees. Other unfunded commitments to extend credit also include liquidity facilities to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs; for further information, see Note 15.(e)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included unissued standby letters of credit commitments of $44.8 billion and $42.8 billion, respectively.(f)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the U.S. portion of the contractual amount of total wholesale lending-related commitments was 67% and 68%, respectively.(g)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $216.3 billion and $176.4 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral comprises primarily cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies.(h)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the amount of commitments related to forward-starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements were $40.7 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements with regular-way settlement periods were $33.5 billion and $28.3 billion, at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(i)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included unfunded commitments of $130 million and $215 million, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $691 million and $1.9 billion, at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, to other equity investments. These commitments included $111 million and $184 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3. In addition, at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $4.5 billion.(j)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value.Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, and extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged finance activities, which were $23.1 billion and $18.3 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4.In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as clearing and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. Tri-party repurchase daily balances averaged $181 billion and $279 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $182 billion and $287 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. GuaranteesThe Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $852 million and $945 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $229 million and $265 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $623 million and $680 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $53.5 billion and $56.3 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to  certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $27.2 billion and $27.0 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.9 billion and 2.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $86 million and


172



$109 million and derivative receivables of $42 million and $37 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsMortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs, as described in Note 15 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm has been, and may be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs (e.g., with “make-whole” payments to reimburse the GSEs for their realized losses on liquidated loans). To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense.For additional information, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.

(a)On October 25, 2013, the Firm announced that it had reached a $1.1 billion agreement with the FHFA to resolve, other than certain limited types of exposures, outstanding and future mortgage repurchase demands associated with loans sold to the GSEs from 2000 to 2008.(b)Presented net of third-party recoveries and include principal losses and accrued interest on repurchased loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expense. Make-whole settlements were $1 million and $133 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively and $3 million and $254 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(c)Included a provision related to new loan sales of $1 million and $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $2 million and $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.
Loans sold with recourse
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $6.8 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $115 million and $131 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.

Note 22 – Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, see Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Pledged assetsAt June 30, 2014, financial assets were pledged to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial assets owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had pledged assets of $269.0 billion and $251.3 billion, respectively, at Federal Reserve Banks and FHLBs. In addition, as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had pledged $53.9 billion and $60.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities, see Note 12. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt, see Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.CollateralAt June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $777.3 billion and $726.7 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $586.6 billion and $543.5 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. Note 23 – LitigationContingenciesAs of June 30, 2014, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $4.6 billion at June 30, 2014. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm’s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.CIO Investigations and Litigation. The Firm has been sued in a consolidated shareholder purported class action, a consolidated purported class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and shareholder derivative actions brought in Delaware state court and in New York federal and state court relating to 2012 losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). Plaintiffs in two of the shareholder derivative actions and the ERISA action have appealed the dismissal of their claims. The Firm also continues to cooperate with ongoing government investigations.Credit Default Swaps Investigations and Litigation. In July 2013, the European Commission (the “EC”) filed a Statement of Objections against the Firm (including various subsidiaries) and other industry members in connection with its ongoing investigation into the credit default swaps (“CDS”) marketplace. The EC asserts that between 2006 and 2009, a number of investment banks acted collectively through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) and Markit Group Limited (“Markit”) to foreclose exchanges from the potential market for exchange-traded credit derivatives. The Firm submitted a response to the Statement of Objections in January 2014, and the EC held a hearing in May 2014. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) also has an ongoing investigation into the CDS marketplace, which was initiated in July 2009.Separately, the Firm and other industry members are defendants in nine purported class actions (all consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) filed on behalf of purchasers and sellers of CDS and asserting federal antitrust law claims. Each of the complaints refers to the ongoing investigations by the EC and DOJ into the CDS market, and alleges that the defendant investment banks and dealers, including the Firm, as well as Markit and/or ISDA, collectively prevented new entrants into the CDS market. Defendants moved to dismiss in May 2014.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm has received information requests, document production notices and related inquiries from various U.S. and non-U.S. government authorities regarding the Firm’s foreign exchange trading business. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with the relevant authorities.Since November 2013, a number of class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against a number of foreign exchange dealers, including the Firm, for alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and unjust enrichment based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates reported on the WM/Reuters service. In March 2014, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss in May 2014.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The parties have entered into an agreement to settle the cases, for a cash payment of $6.1 billion to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm’s share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network’s rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. In December 2013, the Court issued a decision granting final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants have appealed. Certain merchants that opted out of the class settlement have filed actions against Visa and MasterCard, as well as  against the Firm and other banks, which are subject to pending motions to dismiss.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending cases that allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management (“JPMIM”) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited claim that JPMIM is liable for losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. Discovery is proceeding.Italian Proceedings.City of Milan. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the “City”) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the District Court of Milan alleging a breach of advisory obligations in connection with a bond issue by the City in June 2005 and an associated swap transaction. The Firm has entered into a settlement agreement with the City to resolve the City’s civil proceedings.Four current and former JPMorgan Chase employees and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) were directed by a criminal judge to participate in a trial that started in May 2010. As it relates to JPMorgan Chase individuals, two were acquitted and two were found guilty of aggravated fraud with sanctions of prison sentences, fines and a ban from dealing with Italian public bodies for one year. JPMorgan Chase (along with other banks involved) was found liable for breaches of Italian administrative law. JPMorgan Chase and the individuals appealed, and the Court fully acquitted JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its employees, stating that there was no case to answer. The deadline to file an appeal to the Italian Supreme Court has passed without an appeal being filed.Parmalat. In 2003, following the bankruptcy of the Parmalat group of companies (“Parmalat”), criminal prosecutors in Italy investigated the activities of Parmalat, its directors and the financial institutions that had dealings with them following the collapse of the company. In March 2012, the criminal prosecutor served a notice indicating an intention to pursue criminal proceedings against four former employees of the Firm (but not against the Firm) on charges of conspiracy to cause Parmalat’s insolvency by underwriting bonds and continuing derivatives trading when Parmalat’s balance sheet was false. A preliminary hearing, in which the judge will determine whether to recommend that the matter go to a full trial, is ongoing.In addition, the administrator of Parmalat commenced five civil actions against JPMorgan Chase entities including: two claw-back actions; a claim relating to bonds issued by Parmalat in which it is alleged that JPMorgan Chase kept Parmalat “artificially” afloat and delayed the declaration of insolvency; and similar allegations in two claims relating to derivatives transactions.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Committee”) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $7.9 billion in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI’s bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s collateral requests hastened LBHI’s bankruptcy. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint that sought to void the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008.The Firm has filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion in claims (the “Clearing Claims”) against the estate of Lehman Brothers Inc., LBHI’s broker-dealer subsidiary. Discovery is ongoing.LBHI and the Committee have filed an objection to the claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to the Clearing Claims, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for such claims in a commercially reasonable manner. LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors have also filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm responded to this separate complaint and objection in February 2013. The Clearing Claims and the derivatives claims, together with other claims of the Firm against Lehman entities, have been paid in full, subject to the outcome of the objections filed by LBHI and the Committee. Discovery in both cases is ongoing.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the EC, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various  parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. In December 2013, JPMorgan Chase reached a settlement with the EC regarding its Japanese Yen LIBOR investigation and agreed to pay a fine of €80 million. Investigations by the EC with regard to other reference rates remain open. In May 2014, the EC issued a Statement of Objections outlining its case against the Firm (and others) as to EURIBOR. The Firm will file a response. In January 2014, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced that it has discontinued its investigation related to Yen LIBOR.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class actions filed in various United States District Courts, in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and/or EURIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are impacted by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR or EURIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages.The U.S. dollar LIBOR-related purported class actions have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In March 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims in three lead class actions, including dismissal with prejudice of the antitrust claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction. In September 2013, class plaintiffs in two of the three lead class actions filed amended complaints and others sought leave to amend their complaints to add additional allegations. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaints and opposed the requests to amend. In June 2014, the Court issued a further order granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motions to dismiss the remaining claims. In relation to the Firm, the Court has permitted certain claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims to proceed. With respect to the third lead class action, which the Court dismissed in its entirety, after plaintiff’s appeal was dismissed by the Second Circuit, plaintiff sought and obtained leave to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the question whether its appeal could proceed before final resolution of the other consolidated class actions. To date, the other U.S. dollar LIBOR cases have been stayed.The purported class action alleging manipulation of Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased or sold exchange-traded Euroyen futures and options contracts. In March 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss including dismissal of plaintiff’s antitrust and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants have filed motions to reconsider, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims. Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to further amend the complaint to add additional parties and claims.In March 2014, the Firm was added as a defendant in a putative class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the interest rate benchmark EURIBOR. The Firm was also named as a nominal defendant in a derivative action in the Supreme Court of New York in the County of New York against certain current and former members of the Firm’s board of directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm’s purported role in manipulating LIBOR. In March 2014, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and plaintiff did not appeal this decision. Madoff Litigation and Investigations. Settlements with the court-appointed trustee (the “Trustee”) for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“BLMIS”) and with plaintiffs representing a class of former BLMIS customers who lost all or a portion of their principal investments with BLMIS have now been approved. Certain customers have opted out of the class action settlement.Various subsidiaries of the Firm, including J.P. Morgan Securities plc, have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, “Fairfield”), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions seek to recover payments made by the funds to defendants totaling approximately $155 million. All but two of these actions have been dismissed. In addition, a purported class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against the Firm and certain subsidiaries to an already pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The Court dismissed these complaints and plaintiffs have appealed. In September 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision. The plaintiffs then petitioned the entire Court for a rehearing of the appeal, and in May 2014 the Court denied the petition.The Firm is a defendant in five other Madoff-related investor actions pending in New York state court. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The Firm has moved to dismiss these actions. In May 2014, the parties submitted briefs on the res judicata effect of the class action settlement and a decision is pending.A purported class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., Madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested)  in Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and were not included in the class action settlement. These plaintiffs allege violations of the federal securities law, federal and state racketeering statutes and multiple common law claims including breach of trust, aiding and abetting embezzlement, unjust enrichment, conversion and commercial bad faith. The complaint seeks compensatory damages in the amount of the last statement balance for each plaintiff and punitive damages. A similar action has been filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the “Florida Action”), although it is not styled as a class action, and the plaintiffs, in addition to net winners, include a small number of net loser opt-outs. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the Florida Action which includes only net winners, includes a claim pursuant to a Florida statute and dismisses three common law claims that were included in the earlier complaint.Three shareholder derivative actions have also been filed in New York federal and state court against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former Board members, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm’s relationship with Bernard Madoff and the alleged failure to maintain effective internal controls to detect fraudulent transactions. The actions seek declaratory relief and damages. In July 2014, the federal court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss two of the actions and defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the remaining state court action.MF Global. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one of several defendants in a number of purported class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global’s publicly traded securities asserting violations of federal securities laws and alleging that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global. The Firm also has responded to inquiries from the CFTC relating to the Firm’s banking and other business relationships with MF Global, including as a depository for MF Global’s customer segregated accounts.Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates (together, “JPMC”), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, “Bear Stearns”) and certain Washington Mutual affiliates (together, “Washington Mutual”) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). These cases include purported class action suits on behalf of MBS purchasers, actions by individual MBS purchasers and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of MBS offerings. Following the settlements referred to under “Repurchase Litigation” and “Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation” below, there are currently pending and tolled investor and monoline insurer claims involving MBS with an original principal balance of approximately $48 billion, of which $42 billion involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual as issuer and $6 billion involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual solely as underwriter. The Firm and certain of its current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities, and trustees have asserted or have threatened to assert claims that loans in securitization trusts should be repurchased.Issuer Litigation – Class Actions. Three purported class actions were brought against JPMC and Bear Stearns as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings) in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. The Firm has reached an agreement to settle one of these purported class actions, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. That settlement has received final court approval. Motions to dismiss have largely been denied in the remaining two cases pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which are in various stages of litigation.Issuer Litigation – Individual Purchaser Actions. In addition to class actions, the Firm is defending individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings). These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the United States and are in various stages of litigation.Monoline Insurer Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending actions relating to a monoline insurer’s guarantees of principal and interest on certain classes of 11 different Bear Stearns MBS offerings. These actions are pending in state court in New York and are in various stages of litigation. Underwriter Actions. In actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable in various situations, such as where the issuers are now defunct. There are currently such actions pending against the Firm in federal and state courts in various stages of litigation.Repurchase Litigation. The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees or master servicers of various MBS trusts and others on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys’ fees and costs and other remedies. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, has filed such a suit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Washington Mutual and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) in connection with a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation. In addition, the Firm received threatened litigation demands by securitization trustees, as well as demands by investors directing trustees to investigate claims or bring litigation, which allege obligations to repurchase loans and to address servicing deficiencies. These include but are not limited to a demand from a law firm, as counsel to a group of 21 institutional MBS investors, to various trustees to investigate potential repurchase and servicing claims. These investors purported to have 25% or more of the voting rights in trusts sponsored by the Firm or its affiliates with an original principal balance of more than $174 billion (excluding 52 trusts sponsored by Washington Mutual, with an original principal balance of more than $58 billion). Pursuant to a settlement agreement, JPMC and this investor group have made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to the 330 MBS trusts. The offer, which is subject to acceptance by the trustees, and potentially a judicial approval process, does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. On August 1, 2014, the trustees announced their determination to accept the offer in whole or in part for 310 of the 330 MBS trusts and to proceed with seeking judicial approval of such acceptance. The trustees rejected the settlement offer in whole or in part for six trusts that are subject to pending monoline insurer or repurchase litigation, and received a 60-day extension to solicit investor direction on whether the offer should be accepted for an additional 14 trusts and for certain loan groups in 13 trusts for which the offer was accepted in part on August 1, 2014.There are additional repurchase and servicing claims made against trustees not affiliated with the Firm but involving trusts that the Firm sponsored.Derivative Actions. Shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities have been filed against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors, in New York state court and California federal court. Two of the New York actions have been dismissed and defendants have filed, or intend to file, motions to dismiss the remaining actions.Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. The Firm has also received other subpoenas and informal requests for information from federal and state authorities concerning the issuance and underwriting of MBS-related matters. The Firm continues to respond to these MBS-related regulatory inquiries.In addition, the Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with requests for information from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut, subpoenas and requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement, and a request from the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program to conduct a review of certain activities, all of which relate to, among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain secondary market trading in residential and commercial MBS. The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation.Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorney General of Massachusetts filed an action against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company, asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry’s electronic mortgage registry. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the action, which remains pending.The Firm is named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. The plaintiffs have moved for class certification.One shareholder derivative action has been filed in New York Supreme Court against the Firm’s Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. In June 2014, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which is pending.The Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm’s compliance with the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) in connection with its mortgage lending practices. In addition, three municipalities have commenced litigation against the Firm alleging violations of the FHA and ECOA and seeking damages in the form of lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. A motion to dismiss has been filed in one of the actions.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is responding to inquiries by the Executive Office of the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and various regional U.S. Bankruptcy Trustees relating to mortgage payment change notices and escrow statements in bankruptcy proceedings.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that  all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees.Power Matters. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is investigating matters relating to the bidding activities that were the subject of the July 2013 settlement between J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. Referral Hiring Practices Investigations. Various regulators are investigating, among other things, the Firm’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with respect to the Firm’s hiring practices related to candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials, and its engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these investigations. Sworn Documents, Debt Sales and Collection Litigation Practices. The Firm has been responding to formal and informal inquiries from various state and federal regulators regarding practices involving credit card collections litigation (including with respect to sworn documents), the sale of consumer credit card debt and securities backed by credit card receivables.Separately, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and multiple state Attorneys General are conducting investigations into the Firm’s collection and sale of consumer credit card debt. The California and Mississippi Attorneys General have filed separate civil actions against JPMorgan Chase & Co., Chase Bank USA, N.A. and Chase BankCard Services, Inc. alleging violations of law relating to debt collection practices.Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC and amended to include JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a defendant, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. The District Court denied as premature motions by JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank’s claims. The defendants have filed additional motions as to that issue.An action filed by certain holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt against JPMorgan Chase, which alleges that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at a price that was allegedly too low, remains pending. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs’ claim that JPMorgan Chase tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs’ bond contracts with Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closure. Discovery is ongoing.JPMorgan Chase has also filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank and in its corporate capacity asserting multiple claims for indemnification under the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement between JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC relating to JPMorgan Chase’s purchase of most of the assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank. *     *     *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its  outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm incurred legal expense of $669 million and $678 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $707 million and $1.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.Note 24 – Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business Segment Results on page 19 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 84–85 and Note 33 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Segment resultsThe accompanying tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm revised the capital allocated to certain businesses and will continue to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments. Further refinements may be implemented in future periods.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of June 30, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, and the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, included in the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 19, 2014, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Active foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings are ongoing. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.Allowance for loan losses to total loans: Represents period-end allowance for loan losses divided by retained loans.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt, equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates.Benefit obligation: Refers to the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans.Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e., Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security and is assigned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s. This system facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities. A similar system is used to identify non- U.S. securities (CUSIP International Numbering System).Exchange traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk provided by credit bureaus, typically produced from statistical models by Fair Isaac Corporation utilizing data collected by the credit bureaus.Forward points: Represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., “spot rate”) to determine the forward exchange rate.Group of Seven (“G7”) nations: Countries in the G7 are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. G7 government bonds: Bonds issued by the government of one of the G7 nations.Headcount-related expense: Includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.Home equity - senior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds the first security interest on the property.Home equity - junior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens.Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment system. “Investment grade” generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a “BBB-”/“Baa3” or better, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.LLC: Limited Liability Company.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.Mortgage product types:Alt-AAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans to customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningful.Over-the-counter derivatives (“OTC”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.Over-the-counter cleared derivatives (“OTC cleared”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instruments, private equity investments, and physical commodities used in market-making and client-driven activities. In addition, Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specified risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”): Risk-weighted assets consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk-weighted assets.Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the related mortgage and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds.Structural interest rate risk: Represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm.Structured notes: Structured notes are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. Where present, the embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.Trade-date and settlement-date: For financial instruments, the trade-date is the date that an order to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire an instrument is executed in the market. The trade-date may differ from the settlement-date, which is the date on which the actual transfer of a financial instrument between two parties is executed. The amount of time that passes between the trade-date and the settlement-date differs depending on the financial instrument. For repurchases under the common equity repurchase program, except where the trade-date is specified, the amounts disclosed are presented on a settlement-date basis. In the Capital Management section on pages 74–80, and where otherwise specified, repurchases under the common equity repurchase program are presented on a trade-date basis because the trade-date is used to calculate the Firm’s regulatory capital.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations:Obligations of agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury.Value-at-risk (“VaR”): A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.Wallet: Proportion of fee revenues based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e. the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic, a third party provider of investment banking competitive analysis and volume-based league tables for the above noted industry products. Warehouse loans: Consist of prime mortgages originated with the intent to sell that are accounted for at fair value and classified as trading assets.Washington Mutual transaction: On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain of the assets of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual”) from the FDIC.

Item 3    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis on pages 69–71 of this Form 10-Q and pages 142–148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

Item 4    Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 182 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
During the three months ended June 30, 2014, there were no shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof.
Repurchases under the common equity repurchase program
On March 13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. The amount of equity that may be repurchased by the Firm is also subject to the amount that is set forth in the Firm’s annual capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process. In conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s release of its 2014 CCAR results, the Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized the Firm to repurchase $6.5 billion of common equity between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2014, $5.0 billion (on a trade-date basis) of such repurchase capacity remains. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity-based compensation plans.The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, on a trade-date basis. As of June 30,

2014

The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading “black-out periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information.The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.


Shares repurchased, on a settlement-date basis, pursuant to the common equity repurchase program during the six months ended June 30, 2014, were as follows.

Item 5    Other Information
Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report, the Firm is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by any of its affiliates during the three months ended June 30, 2014 that requires disclosure under Section 219.Carlson Wagonlit Travel (“CWT”), a business travel management firm in which JPMorgan Chase has invested through its merchant banking activities, may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Firm, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. CWT has informed the Firm that, during the three months ended June 30, 2014, it booked approximately 2 flights (of the approximately 15 million transactions it booked during the period) to Iran on Iran Air for passengers, including employees of foreign governments and/or non-governmental organizations. All of such flights originated outside of the United States from countries that permit travel to Iran, and none of such passengers were persons designated under Executive Orders 13224 or 13382 or were employees of foreign governments that are targets of U.S. sanctions. CWT and the Firm believe that this activity is permissible pursuant to certain exemptions from U.S. sanctions for travel-related transactions under the International Emergency Economic

Powers Act, as amended. CWT had approximately $5,000 in gross revenues attributable to these transactions. CWT has informed the Firm that it intends to continue to engage in this activity so long as such activity is permitted under U.S. law.

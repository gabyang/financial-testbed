Business Developments
War in UkraineThe duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain. The Firm has taken steps to close positions and reduce exposures connected with the war, and continues to assist clients with fulfilling or terminating pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks.The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However, the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine, including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, could have adverse effects on the Firm’s businesses.The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks.Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 64-72, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75, Market Risk Management on pages 77-81, Country Risk Management on pages 82-83 and Operational Risk Management on page 84 for additional information.For purposes of this Form 10-Q, “Russia” refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management framework; and “Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia.Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transitionJPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to make progress with respect to the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs to comply with the International Organization of Securities Commission's standards for transaction-based benchmark rates.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:•lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile market conditions continued to have a negative impact on issuance activity, and•lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals.Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28-33 and Note 5 for additional information.Principal transactions revenue increased primarily in CIB, reflecting:•higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, as elevated volatility drove a strong performance in the macro businesses, particularly Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets, and•higher revenue associated with Derivatives in Equity Markets.Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $31 million, compared with a gain of $108 million in the prior year.Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.Refer to CIB results on pages 28-33, and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased as a result of lower cash management fees on higher credits earned by clients, in CB and CIB. Refer to CIB and CB segment results on pages 28-33, pages 34-37 and Note 5 for additional information.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased, reflecting:•lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from lower average market levels, largely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers,•lower brokerage commissions largely in AWM reflecting reduced volumes, and•lower administration fees in CIB on reduced assets under custody reflecting lower market levels,partially offset by•higher travel-related commissions in CCB.Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 23-27, pages 28-33 and pages 38-41 and Note 5 for additional information.Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42-43 and Note 9 for additional information.Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:•lower production revenue from lower margins and volume,partially offset by •higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain in MSR risk management, compared with a net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs.Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27 and Notes 5 and 14 for additional information.Card income increased, reflecting higher revenue on volume growth in commercial card and merchant processing in CIB and CB.Card income in CCB was relatively flat as the impact from the increase in debit and credit card sales volume was offset by higher amortization related to new account origination costs. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 23-27, pages 28-33 and pages 34-37 and Note 5 for additional information.Other income decreased reflecting: •lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume, and•net losses on equity investments in CIB, compared with a gain in the prior year,partially offset by•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.Refer to Note 4 for additional information on net investment hedges.Net interest income increased driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower Markets NII.The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 trillion, up $125 billion, and the yield was 3.05%, up 125 basis points (“bps”).

The net yield excluding Markets was 2.81%, up 90 bps.Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 182 for further information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding Markets.Year-to-date resultsInvestment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:•lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity, and•lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals.Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting:•higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a strong performance in the macro businesses, particularly Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products and Credit, and•higher revenue associated with Derivatives and Prime Brokerage in Equity Markets,largely offset by•a loss of $773 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB, compared with a gain of $338 million in the prior year. The loss in the current year reflected funding spread widening and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, •net markdowns predominantly recorded in the second quarter of 2022 on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB,•net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year, and•net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on these transactions.Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to higher service fee volume in CCB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased, predominantly driven by:•higher travel-related commissions in CCB,•higher asset management fees, including in AWM due to the removal of most money market fund fee waivers and net inflows, largely offset by lower market levels and•higher annuity sales in CCB,partially offset by•lower administration fees in CIB on reduced assets under custody reflecting lower market levels.Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO.Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:•lower production revenue from lower margins and volume,largely offset by •higher net mortgage servicing revenue resulting from–a net gain in MSR risk management, compared with a net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs, and–higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced. Card income decreased due to higher amortization related to new account origination costs in Card, partially offset by higher revenue on volume growth in commercial card and merchant processing in CIB and CB.Other income decreased reflecting: •lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume,•net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM, compared with net gains in the prior year,partially offset by•proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022 in Corporate,•higher net gains related to certain other Corporate investments, •a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan in CB, and•the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior year on certain renewable energy investments in CIB.Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII, as well as lower NII from PPP loans.The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up $203 billion, and the yield was 2.38%, up 56 basis points (“bps”).

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits and loan growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting:•the impact of netting on client-driven market-making activities and collateral requirements, as well as•higher demand for securities to cover short positions.Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets, reflecting lower client-driven activities, partially offset by higher demand for securities to cover short positions.Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed.Trading assets increased driven by: •higher derivative receivables, primarily foreign exchange and commodities as a result of market movements, as well as higher levels of debt instruments related to client-driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets, and•higher deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.Investment securities reflects the transfer of $73.2 billion of securities from the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio to the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio in the second quarter of 2022.•The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, as well as unrealized losses, which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), largely offset by net purchases•The increase in HTM was also due to purchases, partially offset by paydowns. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42-43, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 76, and Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.Loans increased, reflecting:•higher originations and revolver utilization in CB,•higher balances in Card driven by growth in revolving balances on higher consumer spending and net new originations, and•higher wholesale loans in CIB,partially offset by•lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and•the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in CBB.The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net addition of $1.8 billion to the allowance for loan losses, consisting of:•$1.6 billion in wholesale, resulting from–loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and–updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast, including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios and the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and•$204 million in consumer driven by Card, reflecting higher outstanding balances, predominantly offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.There was also a $290 million addition to the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 57-76, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased predominantly due to higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets, including prime brokerage.Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased, reflecting: •higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates and net additions, partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows, and•additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Global Shares PLC and Figg, Inc. in the third quarter of 2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.Refer to Note 14 for additional information.

Deposits decreased reflecting:•a reduction in non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM net outflows into investments as a result of the rising interest rate environment,partially offset by•growth from new consumer and small business accounts in CCB that more than offset the decline in deposits in existing accounts as spending continued to grow, and•an increase in Corporate driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 and Notes 2 and 15 for additional information. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased due to:•higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets,partially offset by•lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 and Note 10 for additional information.Short-term borrowings decreased as a result of lower financing requirements in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for additional information.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.Accounts payable and other liabilities increased predominantly due to higher client payables related to client-driven activities primarily in Markets, including prime brokerage.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased driven by higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper issued to third parties. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional information, specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.Long-term debt decreased driven by:•a decline in the fair value of structured notes in Markets, and fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and CIO related to higher rates, largely offset by•net issuances in Markets and Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for additional information. Stockholders’ equity decreased as a result of net unrealized losses in AOCI, which were predominantly driven by the impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20 for a definition of managed basis.Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments.Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results.Capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 48, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.Quarterly results Net income was $4.3 billion, relatively flat compared to the prior year.Net revenue was $14.3 billion, an increase of 14%. Net interest income was $10.6 billion, up 26%, driven by:•higher margins and growth in deposits in CBB, and higher revolving loans in Card, partially offset by•a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB and lower NII in Home Lending predominantly due to tighter loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $3.8 billion, down 9%, driven by:•lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending, and•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume,partially offset by•higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain in MSR risk management compared with a net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs,•higher travel-related commissions,•a gain on warrants associated with an equity investment, and•card income was relatively flat as the impact from the increase in debit and credit card sales volume was offset by higher amortization related to new account origination costs.Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income. Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, up 11%, reflecting:•investments in the business and increased structural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, marketing and technology,  partially offset by•lower volume- and revenue-related expenses driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets.The provision for credit losses was $529 million, reflecting:•net charge-offs of $679 million, up $188 million, largely driven by loan growth in Card, partially offset by•a $150 million reserve release in Home Lending. The allowance for loan losses in Card was flat as the addition to the allowance resulting from higher outstanding balances was offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.The prior year included a $950 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB.Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.Year-to-date results Net income was $10.3 billion, down 38%, predominantly driven by a net increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year. Net revenue was $39.2 billion, an increase of 4%. Net interest income was $27.6 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by:•growth in deposits and higher margins in CBB, and higher revolving loans in Card, partially offset by•a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB, and lower NII in Home Lending driven by tighter loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $11.6 billion, down 14%, driven by:•lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending,•lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to new account origination costs, and •lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume,partially offset by•higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain in MSR risk management compared with a net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs and higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced,•higher asset management, administration and commissions revenue predominantly driven by travel-related commissions and increased annuity sales, and•higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee volume.Noninterest expense was $23.5 billion, up 9%, reflecting:•investments in the business and increased structural expenses, largely driven by compensation, marketing and technology,  partially offset by•lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, largely driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher operating losses.The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, reflecting:•net charge-offs of $1.8 billion, down $403 million, driven by Card, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances continue to decline, impacted by the growth in consumer spending, and•a $125 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses driven by Card, reflecting higher outstanding balances, predominantly offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.The prior year included an $8.2 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information.For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net interest income was $2.2 billion, up 44%, driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth in loans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs on loans and lower deposits.Noninterest revenue was $836 million, down 15%, driven by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees, partially offset by mark-ups on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio. Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, up 14%, largely driven by higher structural and volume- and revenue-related expense, including compensation.The provision for credit losses was $618 million, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, largely driven by growth in loans and lending-related commitments and the impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, compared with a net benefit of $363 million in the prior year.

Net interest income was $5.5 billion, up 22%, driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth in loans, largely offset by the impact of higher funding costs on loans. Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion, down 9%, driven by lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio, partially offset by a gain on an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan.Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, up 16%, predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-related and structural expense, including compensation. The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, driven by growth in loans and lending-related commitments and the impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast, compared with a net benefit of $858 million in the prior year.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $294 million, compared with a net loss of $916 million in the prior year.Net revenue was a loss of $302 million, compared with a loss of $1.3 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower noninterest revenue.Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.1 billion, compared with a loss of $242 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by: •higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities  portfolios, and•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on certain revenues, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, partially offset by•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and•lower net losses on certain legacy private equity investments.Noninterest expense of $305 million was up $145 million, predominantly driven by: •higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, and•higher structural expense, including higher compensation  predominantly offset by the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on certain expenses, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening.The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.The current period income tax benefit was predominantly driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements and the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.Year-to-date results Net loss was $1.3 billion, compared with a net loss of $3.1 billion in the prior year.Net revenue was a loss of $1.1 billion, compared with a loss of $2.9 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower noninterest revenue.Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.7 billion, compared with a loss of $68 million in the prior year, driven by:•higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolios,•the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain revenues, primarily as result of the U.S. dollar strengthening,•net losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared with net gains in prior year,•net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method investment related to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, and•net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on these transactions,partially offset by •proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022, and•higher net gains related to certain other Corporate investments.Noninterest expense of $695 million was down $856 million, predominantly driven by: •lower structural expense reflecting the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, and lower technology expense, partially offset by higher compensation related expense,largely offset by•higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.The prior year included a contribution to the Firm's     Foundation.The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.The current period income tax benefit was predominantly driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements and the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the first quarter of 2022.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other                                                                                                                                                                                  products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: •Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; •Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and •Firmwide structures for risk governance. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s capital risk.Basel III OverviewThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios. Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. While the Firm’s SLR is currently more binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios, the Firm expects that in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios will become more binding due to increases in the Firm's risk-based regulatory capital requirements. As a result, the Firm announced the redemption of $5.43 billion of preferred stock and issued $3.5 billion of subordinated notes in the third quarter of 2022 to rebalance the Firm's capital components. Refer to SLR on page 48 and capital actions on pages 48-49 for additional information.Key Regulatory DevelopmentsCECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition provisions, which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of September 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance.Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized.Risk-based Capital Targets The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 12.5% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 13.0% by the end of the first quarter of 2023. These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect, taking into account the Firm's increasing risk-based regulatory capital requirements. The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 21 for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2022, predominantly due to long-term debt issuances and CIB Markets activities.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2022 due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily from a reduction in cash from a decline in deposits and loan growth.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was lower than the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth, non-HQLA investment security purchases, and a decline in the market value of HQLA-eligible investment securities in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by an increase in deposits. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.Other liquidity sourcesIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $771 billion and $914 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above.The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $317 billion and $308 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.
51


NSFRThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.  As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in 2023.
52



Funding
Sources of fundsManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements.The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.  Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance sheet obligations.
Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the average deposit balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.


Average deposits were higher for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting:•an increase in CCB driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers, and growth in time deposits in AWM,partially offset by •declines in both Payments and Securities Services in CIB and in non-operating deposits in CB. Average deposits were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting: •increases in CCB driven by growth from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers, and •net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by •a decline in Securities Services in CIB.Period-end deposits have declined as a result of the migration that began in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in period-end deposits reflects a reduction in non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM net outflows into investments as a result of the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by growth from new consumer and small business accounts in CCB that more than offset the
53


decline in deposits in existing accounts as spending continued to grow.The increase in deposits in Corporate was driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives. Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 16-17 and pages 21-43, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.The following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and average balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 16-17 and Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in commercial paper for the average three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year period, and the decrease in commercial paper at September 30, 2022, from December 31, 2021, was due to changes in the net issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management.
54


Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022, were as follows:

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysisLoans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real estate loans.Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021, reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net recoveries were lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by lower prepayments in the current year due to higher interest rates. Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and lower loan purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.3 billion at September 30, 2022. This amount included $5.3 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5.2 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $35.7 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

The following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs. Refer to Note 11 for further information on modifications for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared with December 31, 2021 predominantly due to PPP loan forgiveness in business banking and paydowns predominantly offset by loan originations in the scored auto portfolio. Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and scored auto charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased when compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and scored auto charge-offs, partially offset by lower scored business banking charge-offs. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.27% and 0.03% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 0.19% and 0.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as net charge-offs benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs in the prior year.
Nonperforming assets

Credit cardTotal credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 largely driven by growth in revolving balances on higher consumer spending and net new originations. The September 30, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.23% and 0.57%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50% but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared with the same period in the prior year driven by loan growth. Net charge-offs decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared with the same period in the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances continue to decline, impacted by the growth in consumer spending. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies.Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loansRefer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.Modifications of credit card loansAt September 30, 2022, the Firm had $794 million of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 66-69 for further information.The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low. As of September 30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming exposure was driven by a decline in lending related commitments and loans, predominantly in CIB and AWM, as a result of net portfolio activity and upgrades, largely offset by downgrades including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 and Country Risk on pages 82-83 for additional information.As of September 30, 2022, retained loans increased $35.9 billion driven by CB and CIB, including increased revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $13.5 billion driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, partially offset by net portfolio activity in AWM.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.0 billion and $38.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, including declines in Consumer & Retail, Real Estate and Technology, Media & Telecommunications. Of the $31.0 billion of criticized exposure at September 30, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.3 billion was performing.The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

Consumer & Retail
Consumer & Retail exposure was $118.9 billion as of September 30, 2022, and predominantly included Retail, Food and Beverage, and Business and Consumer Services as shown in the table below. Criticized exposure decreased by $2.6 billion from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2021 to $7.3 billion at September 30, 2022, driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific downgrades.

Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas exposure was $44.1 billion as of September 30, 2022, including $26.2 billion of Exploration & Production and Oil field Services as shown in the table below. Derivative receivables increased reflecting market movements related to Oil & Gas prices. Criticized exposure decreased by $1.0 billion from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021 to $647 million at September 30, 2022, driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific downgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Since September 30, 2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $596 million driven by paydowns and client-specific upgrades in Real Estate, Individuals and Oil & Gas, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.Receivables from customersReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.Derivative contractsDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 88% at both September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $92.5 billion and $57.1 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.Discussion of changes in the allowanceThe allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022 was $20.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 billion  from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $1.9 billion in wholesale and $168 million in consumer.The net addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from: •loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and•changes to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting–updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios including an increasing forecasted unemployment rate and deterioration in the equity market indices, and–the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022, due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses resulting from higher outstanding balances predominantly offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.Investment securities riskInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At September 30, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $616.5 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42-43 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 77-81 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals.Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages 138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm.The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a)Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.(b)In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.(c)For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR which remained elevated for the period ended June 30, 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR decreased driven by a reduction in nickel-related exposure when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022.(d)The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded.(e)The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.Quarter over quarter resultsAverage total VaR was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2022 when compared with June 30, 2022, reflecting increased market volatility impacting Fixed income, offset by risk reductions within CIB and Credit Portfolio VaR.Year over year resultsAverage total VaR increased by $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was predominantly driven by market volatility impacting Fixed income.The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 261 days, and observed 25 VaR backtesting exceptions due to market volatility that was materially higher than the levels realized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 33 of the 66 days, and observed seven VaR backtesting exceptions predominantly driven by interest rate volatility.The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended September 30, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing.•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information).The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.Refer to pages 141-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management.Sources and measurementThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation. Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables).Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework:•Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received•Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions•Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received•Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions•Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received•Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable; reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposuresThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.
82


Risk ReportingThe following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2022 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.The decrease in exposure to Australia was largely driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits following recent interest rate increases. As of September 30, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $600 million. This amount excludes certain client deposits placed at depository institutions.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Operational Risk Management. Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided below.In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with interpreting and maintaining these complex compliance programs. To manage this increased risk, the Firm implemented additional controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations. Business and technology resiliency riskDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks.Cybersecurity RiskThe Firm continues to face increased risk of cyber attacks due to potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm implemented additional precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm to protect against cybersecurity breaches will provide absolute security against cyber attacks.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.Allowance for credit lossesThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-75 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higherover the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of3.0% in the third quarter of 2023; lowerU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining approximately 4.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately 13.6% in the second quarter of 2024.This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:•The allowance as of September 30, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.•The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.
85


•Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses.To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2022, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences:•An increase of approximately $500 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments•An increase of approximately $2.5 billion for credit card loans•An increase of approximately $4.2 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2022.


Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

ValuationEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.Credit card rewards liabilityThe credit card rewards liability was $11.1 billion and $9.8 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on accelerated spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022. Refer to page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.Income taxesRefer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes.Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment.

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Note 2 – Fair value measurementRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy.

(a)At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $90.1 billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.

(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $882 million and $801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were trading assets of $41 million and $51 million, respectively, and other assets of $841 million and $750 million, respectively.(e)At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $11.4 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $7.5 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $3.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $776 million, nonagency securities of $9 million and non-trading loans of $900 million.(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $11 million, trading loans of $40 million and non-trading loans of $362 million.(d)Comprises trading loans of $825 million and non-trading loans of $312 million.(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(f)Includes equity securities of $807 million including $227 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
The following tables present the assets and liabilities held as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, for which nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

(a)Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.1 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2022, $1.0 billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.(b)Of the $927 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2022, $65 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to 56% with a weighted average of 23%.
Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value adjustments have been recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 171 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:  •Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments •Certain securities financing agreements •Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument  •Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities  •Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value
Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $8.7 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $28 million and $10 million, respectively.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: •collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and •collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a)Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.(b)Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.
Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.(g)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $15.0 billion and $25.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $15.2 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $208 million and $9.7 billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.(d)Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.(e)Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed and SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.1) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at September 30, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.(b)Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately nine years for agency residential MBS, and six years for both agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Firm held $295 million and $440 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)•Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair valueRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.
Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.
Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesale(c)(d)• Residential real estate(a)• Auto and other(b)• Credit card loans• Secured by real estate• Commercial and industrial• Other(e)
(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.(b)Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $68 million and $(246) million, respectively, of which $(48) million and $(80) million, respectively, related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $31 million and $225 million, respectively, of which $30 million and $211 million, respectively, related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

138



Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.
The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(a)At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $27 million and $35 million; 30–149 days past due included $11 million for both periods; and 150 or more days past due included $15 million and $20 million, respectively.(b)At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.(c)At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $26 million and $31 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.(d)Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $42 million and $41 million and $132 million and $127 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.(d)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.(e)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(h)Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.(i)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.(j)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2022.(k)At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $53 million and $66 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modificationsModifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $80 million and $116 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $313 million and $674 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.  Nature and extent of modificationsThe Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions.

(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.
(b)Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions.

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At September 30, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).
Active and suspended foreclosure
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $676 million and $619 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative.(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.(d)The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2022.

Loan modificationsCertain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were not material.

Loan modificationsThe Firm may offer loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.

The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.
For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these risk ratings.

(a)When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.(b)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.
Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. New TDRs were $108 million and $180 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively and $587 million and $832 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New TDRs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity dates primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class in 2022 as well as principal deferrals largely in the Other loan class in 2021. New TDRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected modifications that included extending maturity dates and covenant waivers for both periods as well as the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan in 2021 predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.
The carrying value of TDRs was $852 million and $607 million as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Discussion of changes in the allowanceThe allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022 was $20.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $1.9 billion in wholesale and $168 million in consumer.The net addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from: •loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and•changes to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting–updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios including an increasing forecasted unemployment rate and deterioration in the equity market indices, and–the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022, due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses resulting from higher outstanding balances predominantly offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
(b)As of September 30, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities.Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 59-63, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 64-72 and Note 11 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 85-87 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Multi-seller conduitsIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $12.5 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $11.5 billion and $13.4 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehiclesMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates.

The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.1 billion and $2.6 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. (f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $27.6 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.0 billion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively. Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.
Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government

agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Note 14 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights
Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights.
Goodwill

Goodwill impairment testingGoodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of September 30, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2022, or December 31, 2021, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021.

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized requirements, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives.
The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.
173


Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 172. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiariesThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 172 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information.

Note 24 – Litigation
Contingencies
As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:•the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, •the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, •the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and •the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited.  In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim.Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation.   Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were
175


instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. The FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately $75 million.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need the DOL to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. In October 2022, the DOL published a proposed exemption for the remainder of the disqualification period. This proposal will be open for public comment until December 2022. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10 million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements. In December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective civil investigations of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain communications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping rules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC paid a $125 million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $75 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to requests for information and other material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.In March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities laws based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise adequate oversight over compliance with records preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint in August 2022, which defendants have moved to dismiss.Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims in October 2022. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments.Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to precious metals.In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss. In May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against certain current and former officers and directors of the Firm. The complaint claims the Firm’s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the shareholder’s demand to commence litigation and seeks damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms on the basis of alleged supervisory failures with regard to certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. Defendants have moved to dismiss.Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.*     *     *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $47 million and $76 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $239 million and $289 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.Segment resultsThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed basis. Capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:Results of Review of Interim Financial StatementsWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of September 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions.Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract.

However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Macro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates, Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.MREL: Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilitiesMSR: Mortgage servicing rightsNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net interchange income includes the following components: •Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions. •Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally tied to sales transactions. •Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.NSFR: Net Stable Funding RatioOCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss)OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefitOTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through disclosure requirements which allow market participants to assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Association (“SBA”)PRA: Prudential Regulation AuthorityPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. PSU(s): Performance share units Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules.REO: Real estate ownedReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Revenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.S&P: Standard and PoorsSA-CCR: Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit RiskSAR as it pertains to Hong Kong: Special Administrative RegionSAR(s) as it pertains to employee stock awards: Stock appreciation rightsSCB: Stress capital bufferScored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans to individuals and certain small business loans.SEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.TBVPS: Tangible book value per shareTCE: Tangible common equityTDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.TLAC: Total Loss Absorbing CapacityU.K.: United KingdomU.S.: United States of AmericaU.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.U.S. government agencies: U.S. government agencies include, but are not limited to, agencies such as Ginnie Mae and FHA, and do not include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”).

Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

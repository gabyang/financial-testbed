EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
This executive overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this Form 10-Q. For a complete description of the trends and uncertainties, as well as the risks and critical accounting estimates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business, this Form 10-Q and and the 2017 Form 10-K should be read in their entirety.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards, of which the most significant to the Firm are the guidance related to revenue recognition, and recognition and measurement of financial assets. The revenue recognition guidance required gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, resulting in both total net revenue and total noninterest expense increasing with no impact to net income. The adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance resulted in $505 million of fair value gains, which were recorded in total net revenue in the first quarter of 2018, on certain equity investments that were previously held at cost. For additional information, refer to Note 1.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017, unless otherwise specified.
Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported strong results in the second quarter of 2018 with record net income of $8.3 billion, or $2.29 per share, on net revenue of $27.8 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 14% and ROTCE of 17%.•Net income increased 18%, reflecting higher net revenue and the impact of the lower U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Acts (“TCJA”), partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.•Total net revenue increased 8%. Net interest income was $13.5 billion, up 10%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Noninterest revenue was $14.3 billion, up 6%, driven by higher Markets revenue, investment banking fees and auto lease income, partially offset by lower Card net interchange income. Card net interchange income includes a rewards liability adjustment of approximately $330 million, driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions, partially offset by higher card sales volumes. •Noninterest expense was $16.0 billion, up 8%, driven by higher performance-related compensation expense, investments in technology, auto lease depreciation, volume-related transaction costs, and a loss of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity.•The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, flat compared with the prior year. •The total allowance for credit losses was $14.4 billion at June 30, 2018, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio, excluding the PCI portfolio, of 1.22%, compared with 1.28% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $5.8 billion at June 30, 2018, a decrease from $6.4 billion in the prior year.•Firmwide average core loans increased 6%, and excluding CIB, core loans increased 7%.
Selected capital-related metrics
•The Firm’s Basel III Fully Phased-In CET1 capital was $185 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.0% and 12.8%, respectively.•The Firm’s fully phased-in SLR was 6.5% at June 30, 2018.•The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending the second quarter of 2018 at $55.14, up 3%.ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. Core loans and each of the Fully Phased-In capital and certain leverage measures are all considered key performance measures. For a further discussion of each of these measures, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 15–17, and Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47.

For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, refer to pages 77–79 of this Form 10-Q and pages 138–140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees increased reflecting higher equity underwriting and advisory fees. The increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO and convertible markets. The increase in advisory fees was driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. For additional information, refer to CIB segment results on pages 25–30 and Note 5.Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting higher client-driven market-making revenue in CIB as a result of strength across products in Equity Markets, predominantly in derivatives and prime brokerage. Fixed Income Markets also recorded solid performance with good client activity.

For additional information, refer to AWM, CCB and CIB segment results on pages 35–38, pages 20–24 and pages 25–30, respectively, and Note 5.Investment securities losses increased primarily due to   sales related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees increased reflecting:•higher advisory and equity underwriting fees in CIB. The increase in advisory fees was driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. The increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO market•lower debt underwriting fees primarily driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels and a lower share in leveraged finance.Principal transactions revenue increased primarily reflecting:•higher client-driven market-making revenue in CIB driven by strength across products in Equity Markets, predominantly derivatives and prime brokerage. Fixed Income Markets also recorded strong performance in Commodities and Currencies & Emerging Markets, largely offset by lower revenue in Creditthe increase in client-driven market-making revenue in CIB was partially offset by•private equity losses of $45 million compared with gains of $153 million in the prior year on legacy investments in Corporate.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS
Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1.
Consolidated balance sheets analysis
The following is a discussion of the significant changes between June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a result of net long-term debt maturities and a shift in the deployment of excess cash from deposits with banks into securities purchased under resale agreements. The Firm’s excess cash is largely placed with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve Banks.Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased primarily due to higher client activity in CIB and the shift in the deployment of excess cash from deposits with banks into securities purchased under resale agreements. For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 48–52.Trading assets-debt and equity instruments increased predominantly as a result of client-driven market-making activities in CIB, primarily debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, and equity instruments in prime brokerage, driven by higher client demand. For additional information, refer to Notes 2 and 4. Investment securities decreased primarily reflecting net sales, paydowns and maturities of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), commercial MBS, and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities. For additional information on Investment securities, refer to Corporate segment results on pages 39–40, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 70, and Notes 2 and 9.

Loans increased reflecting:•higher wholesale loans across all lines of business, predominantly driven by CIB, including loans to financial institution and commercial and industrial clients, and in AWM due to higher loans to international and domestic Private Banking clients•lower consumer loans driven by the seasonal decline in credit card balances, paydown of home equity loans, run-off of PCI loans, and a mortgage loan sale, predominantly offset by higher retention of high-quality prime mortgages in CCB and AWM.The allowance for loan losses decreased reflecting: •a net reduction in the wholesale allowance primarily in the Oil & Gas portfolio driven by a single name•the consumer allowance was relatively flat.For a detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 53–70, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12.Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased primarily reflecting higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in CIB.Other assets increased largely reflecting higher auto operating lease assets from growth in business volume in CCB.For information on Goodwill and MSRs, refer to Note 14.

Deposits increased due to:•higher deposits in the consumer business reflecting the continuation of growth from new and existing customers and low attrition rates in CCB, partially offset by balance migration as customers shift from deposits largely into the Firm’s investment-related products; and in the wholesale business reflecting an increase in CIB’s Treasury Services business driven by growth in client activity•lower deposits in the other wholesale businesses primarily driven by the impact of seasonality in CB and AWM, and balance migration in AWM predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products.For more information, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 48–52; and Notes 2 and 15.Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased reflecting higher secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments, partially offset by a change in the mix of funding to short-term borrowings in CIB. Short-term borrowings increased driven by a change in the mix of funding for CIB activities from securities sold under repurchase agreements to short-term borrowings, and the net issuance of commercial paper. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 48–52.

Trading liabilities–debt and equity instruments increased predominantly as a result of client-driven market-making activities in CIB, primarily debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, and equity instruments in prime brokerage. For additional information, refer to Note 2 .Trading liabilities–derivative payables increased predominantly as a result of client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets, which increased equity and interest rate derivative payables. For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on pages 65–66, and Notes 2 and 4. Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased due to net maturities of credit card securitizations. For further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 14 and Notes 13 and 20.Long-term debt decreased primarily driven by lower Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and net maturities of senior debt.

Investing activities
•In 2018, cash used reflected an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements and higher net loans originated, partially offset by lower investment securities.•In 2017, cash provided reflected a decrease in securities purchased under resale agreements and lower investment securities, partially offset by a net increase in loan originations.
Financing activities
•In 2018, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, short-term borrowings and deposits, partially offset by a decrease in long-term borrowings.•In 2017, cash provided reflected higher deposits, and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in long-term borrowings.•Additionally, for both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and dividends on common and preferred stock.For a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows, refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 11–13, Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 48–52 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 92–97 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The Firm is involved with several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees.The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct.The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. In addition, refer to Note 1 for information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measuresThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 84–88. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from  both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level, because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, refer to Business Segment Results on pages 18–40.Additionally, certain credit metrics and ratios disclosed by the Firm exclude PCI loans, and are therefore non-GAAP measures. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 53–70.Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
The following summary tables provide a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1.(a)Predominantly recognized in CIB and CB business segments and Corporate.(b)The decrease in fully taxable-equivalent adjustments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, reflects the impact of the TCJA.

Net interest income excluding CIB’s Markets businesses
In addition to reviewing net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews net interest income excluding net interest income arising from CIB’s Markets businesses to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. This net interest income is referred to as non-markets related net interest income. CIB’s Markets businesses are Fixed Income Markets and  Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income provides investors and analysts with another measure by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

The data presented below are non-GAAP financial measures due to the exclusion of markets-related net interest income arising from CIB.

Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS
Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income  applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

Key performance measures
The Firm considers the following to be key regulatory capital measures:•Capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), and capital and leverage ratios presented under Basel III Standardized and Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and•SLR calculated under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules.The Firm, as well as banking regulators, investors and analysts use these measures to assess the Firm’s regulatory capital position and to compare the Firm’s regulatory capital to that of other financial services companies.For additional information on these measures, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47.

Core loans are also considered a key performance measure. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; and exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans is a measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 15–17.  Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. For further information about line of business capital, refer to Line of business equity on page 46. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. Business segment capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on pages 88-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For a further discussion of those methodologies, refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 55–56 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Segment results – managed basis
Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1.Net income in 2018 for the business segments reflects the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The following tables summarize the business segment results for the periods indicated.

Quarterly results
Net income was $3.4 billion, an increase of 53%.Net revenue was $12.5 billion, an increase of 10%. Net interest income was $8.7 billion, up 13%, driven by:•higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances, and •margin expansion and higher loan balances in Card,•loan spread compression from higher rates in Home Lending and Auto, and•the impact of the sale of the student loan portfolio in the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $3.7 billion, up 2%, driven by:•lower new account origination costs in Card,•higher auto lease volume, and•higher MSR risk management results,predominantly offset by•lower net interchange reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, partially offset by higher card sales volumes. The rewards costs included an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions, and•lower net production revenue reflecting lower mortgage production margins.Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.Noninterest expense was $6.9 billion, up 6%, driven by:•higher auto lease depreciation, and•investments in technology.The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 21% from the prior year, reflecting: •no addition to the allowance for credit losses in the current quarter, compared with a net addition of $250 million in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio, and•lower net charge-offs, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery of approximately $130 million from a loan sale, and reflects continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, predominantly offset by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $6.7 billion, an increase of 60%.Net revenue was $25.1 billion, an increase of 12%.

Noninterest revenue was $7.9 billion, up 13%, driven by:•lower new account origination costs in Card,•higher auto lease volume, and•higher MSR risk management results,•lower net interchange reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, largely offset by higher card sales volumes. The rewards costs included an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions, and•lower net production revenue reflecting lower mortgage production margins.Noninterest expense was $13.8 billion, up 7%, driven by:•investments in technology and marketing,•higher auto lease depreciation, and•continued business growth.The provision for credit losses was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 14% from the prior year, reflecting:•no addition to the allowance for credit losses in the current year, compared with a net addition of $250 million in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio•higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations.

(a)Consists primarily of credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed centrally within CIB and funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives. Results are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.Quarterly results Net income was $3.2 billion, up 18%.Net revenue was $9.9 billion, up 11%.Banking revenue was $3.5 billion, up 9%. Investment banking revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13%, driven by higher equity underwriting and advisory fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. Equity underwriting fees were $570 million, up 49%, driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO and convertible markets. Advisory fees were $626 million, up 24%, driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. Debt underwriting fees were $943 million, flat compared to the prior year. Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 12%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in deposits. Lending revenue was $321 million, down 14%, predominantly driven by lower net interest income primarily reflecting a change in the portfolio composition and overall spread tightening as well as higher gains in the prior year on securities received from restructurings.Markets & Investor Services revenue was $6.5 billion, up 12%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.5 billion, up 7%. Excluding the reduction of approximately $160 million in tax-equivalent adjustments as a result of the TCJA, Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 12%. Fixed Income Markets reflected solid performance across products with good client activity, and improved Commodities revenue compared to a challenging prior year. Equity Markets revenue was $2.0 billion, up 24%, driven by strength across products, predominantly in derivatives and prime brokerage. Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher interest rates and deposit growth, as well as higher asset-based fees driven by net client inflows and higher market levels.The provision for credit losses was an expense of $58 million, reflecting net portfolio activity, including new exposures and loan sales. The prior year was a benefit of $53 million primarily driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas portfolio. Noninterest expense was $5.4 billion, up 11%, predominantly driven by higher performance-related compensation, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology. Year-to-date resultsNet income was $7.2 billion, up 21%. Net revenue was $20.4 billion, up 10%.Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, up 3%. Investment banking revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%, driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees, largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. Advisory fees were $1.2 billion, up 20%, driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. Equity underwriting fees were $916 million, up 14%, driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO market. Debt underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, down 10%, primarily driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels and a lower share in leveraged finance. Treasury Services revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in deposits. Lending revenue was $623 million, down 18%, driven by lower net interest income primarily reflecting a change in the portfolio composition and overall spread tightening as well as higher gains in the prior year on securities received from restructurings.Markets & Investor Services revenue was $14.0 billion, up 14%. The results included approximately $500 million of fair value gains related to the adoption in the first quarter of 2018 of the new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost, and a reduction of approximately $310 million in tax-equivalent adjustments as a result of the TCJA. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $8.0 billion, up 8%. Excluding the impact of these fair value gains and tax-equivalent adjustments, Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 5%, with strong performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Commodities, largely offset by lower revenue in Credit. Equity Markets revenue was $4.0 billion, up 25%, driven by strength across derivatives, prime brokerage and Cash Equities. Securities Services revenue was $2.2 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates and deposit growth as well as higher asset-based fees driven by net client inflows and higher market levels.The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $100 million, primarily driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas portfolio related to a single name, partially offset by net portfolio activity. The prior year was a benefit of $149 million primarily driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas portfolio.Noninterest expense was $11.1 billion, up 10%, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation expense, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are  recorded in principal transactions. For a description of the composition of these income statement line items, refer to Notes 5 and 6. For further information, refer to Markets revenue on page 65 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires: •Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; •Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management by each of the lines of business and corporate functions; and •Firmwide structures for risk governance. The Firm strives for continual improvement through efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent Board oversight. The impact of risk and control issues are carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.

Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm’s approach to risk management involves understanding drivers of risks, risk types, and impacts of risks. Drivers of risk include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:  •Strategic risk is the risk associated with the Firm’s current and future business plans and objectives, including capital risk, liquidity risk, and the impact to the Firm’s reputation.  •Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. •Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.  •Operational risk is the risk associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events and includes compliance risk, conduct risk, legal risk, and estimations and model risk. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts, such as reputation damage, loss of clients, and regulatory and enforcement actions.


41


The Firm has established Firmwide risk management functions to manage different risk types. The scope of a particular risk management function may include multiple risk types. For example, the Firm’s Country Risk Management function oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk. The following provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q and in JPMorgan Chase’s  Annual Report information about the Firm’s management of its key risks can be found.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level and composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable it to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.The Firm’s capital risk management objectives are achieved through the establishment of minimum capital targets and a strong capital governance framework. Capital risk management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. The Firm’s minimum capital targets are based on the most binding of three pillars: an internal assessment of the Firm’s capital needs; an estimate of required capital under the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements; and Basel III Fully Phased-In regulatory minimums. Where necessary, each pillar may include a management-established buffer.For a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, refer to pages 82–91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, Note 19 of this Form 10-Q, and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm). The Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries are subject to Basel III capital rules which include minimum capital ratio requirements that are subject to phase-in periods (“transitional period”) through the end of 2018. While this required capital remains subject to the transitional rules during 2018, as of January 1, 2018, the Firm’s capital in the form of CET1 and Tier 1, and the Firm’s risk-weighted assets were equivalent whether calculated on a transitional basis or on a fully phased-in basis. The capital adequacy of the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, both during the transitional period and upon full phase-in, is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) which, for each quarter, results in the lower ratio as required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Collins Floor”). The Basel III Standardized Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio is the Firm’s current binding constraint, and the Firm expects that this will remain its binding constraint for the foreseeable future.The Firm is subject to minimum capital ratios under Basel III rules and well-capitalized ratios under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 19.The following tables present the Firm’s Transitional and Fully Phased-In risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm’s Basel III ratios exceeded both the Transitional and Fully Phased-In regulatory minimums as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. For a further discussion of these capital metrics, including regulatory minimums, and the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, refer to Strategy and Governance on pages 84–88 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Recent regulatory developments
In April 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) proposed the introduction of a stress buffer framework that would create a single, integrated set of capital requirements by combining the supervisory stress test results of the CCAR assessment and those under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test) with current point-in-time capital requirements. If the proposal is finalized in its current form, the new minimum capital requirements will become effective on October 1, 2019. In addition, in April 2018, the FRB and Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency released a proposal to revise the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (“eSLR”) requirements applicable to the U.S. global systemically important bank (“GSIBs”) and their subsidiary insured depository institutions (“IDIs”) and to make conforming changes to the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) and external long-term debt that satisfies certain eligibility criteria (“eligible LTD”) requirements applicable to U.S. GSIBs. The Firm continues to evaluate the impact of these proposals.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. For a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 92–97 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report and the Firm’s US LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at: (https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm).
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires the Firm to maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A that are in excess of each entity’s standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%.  The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017 based on the Firm’s current interpretation of the finalized LCR framework.

The Firm’s HQLA are expected to be available to meet its liquidity needs in a time of stress.

Other liquidity sourcesAs of June 30, 2018, in addition to assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA under the LCR rule, the Firm had approximately $215 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. This includes HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. As of June 30, 2018, the Firm also had approximately $292 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”), discount windows at Federal Reserve Banks and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at Federal Reserve Bank discount windows. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount windows and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. Funding Sources of fundsManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm’s loan portfolio is funded with a portion of the Firm’s deposits, through securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm’s real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the FHLBs. Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments are primarily funded by the Firm’s securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities-debt and equity instruments, and a portion of the Firm’s long-term debt and stockholders’ equity. In addition to funding securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments, proceeds from the Firm’s debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Refer to the discussion below for additional information relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance.

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposit balances as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and the average deposit balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

A key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
(in billions except ratios)June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Deposits$1,452.1 $1,444.0Deposits as a % of total liabilities62% 63%Loans$948.4 $930.7Loans-to-deposits ratio65% 64%

Deposits increased from December 31, 2017, due to higher deposits in the consumer business reflecting the continuation of growth from new and existing customers and low attrition rates in CCB, partially offset by balance migration as customers shift from deposits largely into the Firm’s investment-related products; and in the wholesale business reflecting an increase in CIB’s Treasury Services business driven by growth in client activity. The increase was partially offset by declines in the other wholesale businesses primarily driven by the impact of seasonality in CB and AWM, and balance migration in AWM predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products.Average deposits increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, due to higher deposits in the consumer business and in CIB, partially offset by declines in AWM and Corporate. Drivers of the changes in average balances for these businesses are generally consistent with the drivers of the changes in the period-end balances described above. The decline in average Corporate deposits was predominantly due to maturities of wholesale non-operating deposits, which are consistent with the Firm’s efforts to reduce such products. The Firm believes average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. For further information on deposit and liability balance trends, refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 18–40 and pages 11–13, respectively.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase at June 30, 2018, from December 31, 2017, reflected higher secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments, partially offset by a change in the mix of funding to short-term borrowings in CIB.  The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities; the Firm’s demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors.The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The increase in commercial paper was due to higher net issuance.

Long-term funding and issuanceLong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. For additional information on the IHC and long-term debt, refer to Liquidity Risk Management and Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm.  Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, refer to SPEs on page 14, and Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4.The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and nonbank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2018, were as follows.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.Chase Bank USA, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLCJ.P. Morgan Securities plcJune 30, 2018Long-term issuerShort-term issuerOutlook Long-term issuerShort-term issuerOutlook Long-term issuerShort-term issuerOutlookMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2Stable Aa3P-1Stable A1P-1StableStandard & Poor’sA-A-2Stable A+A-1Stable A+A-1StableFitch RatingsAA-F1+Stable AAF1+Stable AAF1+Stable
On June 21, 2018, Fitch upgraded the Parent Company’s long term issuer rating to AA- (previously A+) and short term issuer rating to F1+ (previously F1). The long term issuer ratings were also upgraded to AA for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, Chase Bank USA, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (all previously AA-).Downgrades of the Firm’s long-term ratings by one or two notches could result in an increase in its cost of funds, and access to certain funding markets could be reduced. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.

The risk of loss on these assets relates to the residual value of the leased vehicles, which is managed through projection of the lease residual value at lease origination, periodic review of residual values, and through arrangements with certain auto manufacturers that mitigates this risk.(b)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included within the consumer portfolio.(c)Predominantly includes Business Banking loans.(d)For the six months ended June 30, 2017, excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio sale, the net charge-off rate for Total consumer, excluding credit card and PCI loans and loans held-for-sale would have been 0.20%; Total consumer – retained excluding credit card loans would have been 0.18%; Total consumer credit portfolio would have been 0.95%; and Total consumer credit portfolio, excluding PCI loans would have been 1.02%.(e)At both June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, approximately 68% of the PCI option adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) portfolio has been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans.(f)Credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home equity commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For further information, refer to Note 20. (g)Receivables from customers represent held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.(h)Includes billed interest and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible interest and fees.(i)At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC.(j)Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools is performing.(k)Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rates excluded write-offs in the PCI portfolio of $73 million and $22 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $93 million and $46 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67–69 for further information.(l)Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $291 million and $4.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $263 million and $2.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off rates.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysisConsumer loan balances increased from December 31, 2017 predominantly due to originations of high-quality prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet, largely offset by paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. PCI loans are excluded from the following discussions of individual loan products and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm’s consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q.Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio predominantly consists of high-quality prime mortgage loans, with a small component consisting of subprime mortgage loans (approximately 1%). These subprime mortgage loans continue to run off and are performing in line with expectations. The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, increased from December 31, 2017 as the amount of retained originations of primarily high-quality prime mortgage loans exceeded paydowns. Residential mortgage 30+ day delinquencies decreased from December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017 due to lower delinquencies. Net recoveries for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were higher compared with the same period in the prior year reflecting a loan sale as well as continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies.At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included $20.8 billion and $20.2 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. To date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader residential mortgage portfolio. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from December 31, 2017 primarily reflecting loan paydowns. The amount of 30+ day delinquencies decreased from December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of loss mitigation activities. Net recoveries for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2018 improved when compared with the same period in the prior year, as a result of lower loan balances and continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies.At June 30, 2018, approximately 90% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $27 billion at June 30, 2018. This amount included $13 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.

The Firm monitors risks associated with junior lien loans where the borrower has a senior lien loan that is either delinquent or has been modified. These loans are considered “high-risk seconds” and are classified as nonaccrual as they are considered to pose a higher risk of default than other junior lien loans. The carrying value of high-risk seconds declined from December 31, 2017.For further information on the Firm’s home equity portfolio, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 102-107 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Auto: The auto loan portfolio, which predominantly consists of prime-quality loans, declined when compared with December 31, 2017, as paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans were partially offset by new originations. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were relatively flat when compared with the same period in the prior year. Consumer & Business Banking: Consumer & Business Banking loans increased when compared with December 31, 2017, as growth due to loan originations was predominantly offset by paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year.Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans decreased from  December 31, 2017 due to portfolio run off and a loan sale. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 11% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 68% of the portfolio had been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment.

The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses.

The remaining nonaccretable difference for principal losses was $624 million and $842 million at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.(b)Represents both realization of loss upon loan resolution and any principal forgiven upon modification.
Geographic composition of residential real estate loans
For information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s residential real estate loans, refer to Note 11.
Current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices, customer pay downs, and charge-offs or liquidations of higher LTV loans. For further information on current estimated LTVs on residential real estate loans, refer to Note 11.
Loan modification activities for residential real estate loans
The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. The performance of modifications to the residential real estate portfolios as measured through cumulative redefault rates, were not materially different from December 31, 2017. For further information on the Firm’s cumulative redefault rates refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 102-107 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Certain loans that were modified under HAMP and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs have interest rate reset provisions (“step-rate modifications”). Interest rates on these loans generally began to increase commencing in 2014 by 1% per year, and will continue to do so, until the rate reaches a specified cap. The cap on these loans is typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate mortgage loan as of the modification date. At June 30, 2018, the carrying value of non-PCI loans and the unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications, which have not yet met their specified caps, were $2 billion and $5 billion, respectively. The Firm continues to monitor this risk exposure and the impact of these potential interest rate increases is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses.

The following table presents information as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For further information on modifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, refer to Note 11.

When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. For additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae, refer to Note 13.(c)Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans.(d)At both June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans included $2.2 billion of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, refer to Note 11.

Nonperforming assets
The following table presents information as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.

(a)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, and REO insured by U.S. government agencies of $84 million and $95 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.(b)Excludes PCI loans, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans as each of the pools is performing.Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio at June 30, 2018 decreased to $3.6 billion from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017, of which 26% were greater than 150 days past due for both time periods. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 34% and 40% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Credit card Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2017 due to seasonality. The June 30, 2018 30+ day delinquency rate seasonally decreased to 1.65% from 1.80% at December 31, 2017, and the June 30, 2018 90+ day delinquency rate decreased to 0.85% from 0.92% at December 31, 2017, in line with expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to growth in newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates than the more seasoned portion of the portfolio. For further information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans, refer to Note 11.Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income.Modifications of credit card loansAt June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Firm had $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, refer to Note 11.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.The credit quality of the wholesale portfolio was stable for the six months ended June 30, 2018, characterized by low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Refer to industry discussion on pages 62–64 for further information. Retained loans increased across all wholesale lines of business, predominantly driven by CIB, including loans to financial institution and commercial and industrial clients, and in AWM due to higher loans to international and domestic Private Banking clients. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.

In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, and excludes all exposure managed by CCB.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful  categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $11.2 billion at June 30, 2018, compared with $15.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was largely driven by select names within Oil & Gas, including a loan sale. Below are summaries of the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

Loans
In the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For a further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators and sales of loans, refer to Note 11. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring. In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further information on wholesale lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20 .
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. In the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. For a further discussion of derivative contracts, refer to Note 4.The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.
Derivative receivables  (in millions)Derivative receivablesJune 30, 2018December 31, 2017Interest rate$22,971$24,673Credit derivatives624869Foreign exchange16,76316,151Equity10,1767,882Commodity7,9766,948Total, net of cash collateral58,51056,523Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(a)(16,103)(16,108)Total, net of collateral$42,407$40,415
(a)Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $58.5 billion and $56.5 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $16.1 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative transactions move in the Firm’s favor.The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements, refer to Note 4.

The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as assigned by S&P and Moody’s.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 90% at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Credit derivativesThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. For further information on the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 77–79 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q, and Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 138–140 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of June 30, 2018, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The wholesale allowance for credit losses decreased from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a reduction in the allowance for the Oil & Gas portfolio driven by a single name.The consumer allowance for credit losses was relatively flat compared with December 31, 2017.For additional information on the wholesale and consumer credit portfolios, refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 60–66, and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 55–59 and Note 11.

(a)For the six months ended June 30, 2017, excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio transfer, the net charge-off rate for Consumer, excluding credit card would have been 0.18%; total Firm would have been 0.54%; Consumer, excluding credit card and PCI loans would have been 0.20%; and total Firm, excluding PCI would have been 0.56%.(b)Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool. (c)Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.(d)The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.(e)The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

Quarterly discussion
The provision for credit losses was flat as a result of:•a decrease in the consumer provision predominantly reflecting –no addition to the allowance for credit losses in CCB in the current quarter, compared with a net addition in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio –lower net charge-offs, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery from a loan sale, and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, predominantly offset by an increase in  net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations the decrease in the consumer provision was offset by •an increase in the wholesale provision reflecting –a net expense in the current period as a result of net portfolio activity, including new exposures and loan sales, compared with a net benefit in the prior year driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals and Mining portfolios.

Year-to-date discussion
The provision for credit losses decreased as a result of:  •a lower consumer provision predominantly reflecting   –no addition to the allowance for credit losses in CCB in the current year, compared with a net addition in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio –higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations. These were largely offset by lower net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery from a loan sale and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies –the prior year included a $218 million write-down recorded in connection with the sale of the student loan portfolio the decrease in the consumer provision was partially offset by •a lower net benefit in the wholesale provision reflecting  –a net benefit in the current period, primarily driven by a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio, partially offset by other net portfolio activity, compared with a net benefit in the prior year, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals and Mining portfolios.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives or from principal investments managed in various LOBs in predominantly privately-held financial assets and instruments. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is minimized given that Treasury and CIO generally invest in high-quality securities. At June 30, 2018, the investment securities portfolio was $231.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For further information on the investment securities portfolio, refer to Corporate segment results on pages 39–40 and Note 9. For further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio, refer to Market Risk Management on pages 71–75. For further information on related liquidity risk, refer to Liquidity Risk on pages 48–52. Principal investment riskPrincipal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments cover multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. Increasingly, new principal investments are made to enhance or accelerate LOB strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the various LOBs and are reflected within the respective LOB financial results. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets, which requires fair value adjustments upon observable price changes to certain equity investments previously held at cost in the principal investment portfolios. For additional information, refer to Note 2.As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $19.9 billion and $19.5 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments) of $13.6 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.For a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight, refer to page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. For a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, tools used to measure risk, risk monitoring and control and risk identification and classification, refer to Market Risk Management on pages 121-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other measures such as stress testing and nonstatistical measures, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions. For further information, refer to Other risk measures on pages 126-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. For information regarding model reviews and approvals, refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a stable measure of VaR that closely aligns to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business, and provides the necessary and appropriate information to respond to risk events on a daily basis. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. For further information regarding the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR, refer to page 123 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting), refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at:(http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm).The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

(a)Average portfolio VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated.(b)Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across lines of business and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.Quarter over Quarter resultsAverage total VaR decreased by $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared with the prior quarter. The decrease reflects changes in the exposure profile for Equities and Fixed income risk types. Year over Year results Average total VaR increased by $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in the prior year. The increase in average total VaR is primarily due to the inclusion of a Corporate private equity position that became publicly traded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and certain investments in CIB VaR.VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

VaR back-testing
The Firm evaluates the effectiveness of its VaR methodology by back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk related revenue.The Firm’s definition of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments (e.g., liquidity and FVA), net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading.The following chart compares actual daily market risk-related gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2018. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of back-testing disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to covered positions. The chart shows that for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Firm observed five VaR back-testing exceptions and posted market risk-related gains on 75 of the 129 days. The Firm observed one VaR back-testing exception and posted market risk-related gains on 35 of the 65 days for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

Earnings-at-risk
The VaR and sensitivity measures illustrate the economic sensitivity of the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. The Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk exposure through earnings-at-risk, which measures the extent to which changes in interest rates will affect the Firm’s net interest income and interest rate-sensitive fees. For a summary by line of business, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk, refer to the table on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm generates a baseline for net interest income and certain interest rate-sensitive fees, and then conducts simulations of changes for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). This simulation primarily includes retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and excludes other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios consider the impact on exposures as a result of changes in interest rates from baseline rates, as well as pricing sensitivities of deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on scenario interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. The pricing sensitivity of deposits in the baseline and scenarios use assumed rates paid which may differ from actual rates paid due to timing lags and other factors. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors.

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.
JPMorgan Chase’s 12-month earnings-at-risk sensitivity profilesU.S. dollarInstantaneous change in rates (in billions)+200 bps+100 bps-100 bps-200 bpsJune 30, 2018$1.9 $1.0 $(2.1) NM(a) December 31, 2017$2.4 $1.7 $(3.6) NM(a)
(a)Given the level of market interest rates, these downward parallel earnings-at-risk scenarios are not considered to be meaningful.The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is largely a result of assets re-pricing at a faster pace than deposits. The Firm’s net U.S. dollar sensitivities to 200 and 100 basis points instantaneous rate increases each decreased by approximately $500 million and $700 million, respectively, while the Firm’s net U.S. dollar sensitivity to 100 basis points instantaneous decrease in rates decreased by $1.5 billion when compared to December 31, 2017. The primary driver of these decreases was the updating of the Firm’s baseline to reflect higher interest rates. As higher interest rates are reflected in the Firm’s baselines, sensitivities to changes in rates are expected to be less significant.The non-U.S. dollar sensitivities for an instantaneous increase in rates by 200 and 100 basis points results in a 12-month benefit to net interest income of approximately $900 million and $500 million, respectively, at June 30, 2018 and $800 million and $500 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The non-U.S. dollar sensitivities for an instantaneous decrease in rates by 200 and 100 basis points are not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Separately, another U.S. dollar interest rate scenario used by the Firm — involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels — results in a 12-month benefit to net interest income of approximately $500 million and $700 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in net interest income under this scenario reflects the Firm reinvesting at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged. The results of the comparable non-U.S. dollar scenarios are not material to the Firm at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and OCI due to changes in relevant market variables. For additional information on the positions  captured in other sensitivity-based measures, please refer to the Risk identification and classification table on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm has a country risk management framework for monitoring and assessing how financial, economic, political or other significant developments adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios giving rise to country risk to ensure the Firm’s country risk exposures are diversified and that exposure levels are appropriate given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or groups of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the firm, as necessary.For a further discussion of the Firm’s Country Risk Management organization; identification and measurement; stress testing; monitoring and control; and reporting, refer to pages 129–130 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2018. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date.The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. For further information on these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, refer to pages 117–119, page 138 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 67–69 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q.As noted in the discussion on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Refer to Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s

modeled credit loss estimates as of June 30, 2018, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses:•A combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply:◦an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $525 million for PCI loans.◦an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $75 million for residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans.•For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $775 million.•An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1.5 billion.•A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $175 million.The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate.

Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventory
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, refer to Note 2.

(a)For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.0 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.
Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. For a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, refer to Note 2.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm refer to Note 2.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2.Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, refer to Goodwill impairment on pages 139–140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, business performance, the current estimated market cost of equity, and prior projections of business performance for all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of June 30, 2018.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.For additional information on goodwill, refer to Note 14.

Credit card rewards liabilityJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The rewards liability is sensitive to various assumptions, including cost per point and redemption rates for each of the various rewards programs, which are evaluated periodically. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $5.5 billion and $4.9 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.Income taxesFor a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 1, and Income taxes on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Litigation reservesFor a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

FASB Standards Adopted since January 1, 2018 (continued)     Standard Summary of guidance  Effects on financial statements     Definition of a businessIssued January 2017  •  Narrows the definition of a business and clarifies that, to be considered a business, substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) may not be concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets. •  In addition, the definition now requires that a set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.  •  Adopted January 1, 2018. •  The adoption of the guidance had no impact because it is being applied prospectively. Subsequent to adoption, fewer transactions will be treated as acquisitions or dispositions of a business. Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost Issued March 2017  •  Requires the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost to be reported separately in the Consolidated statements of income from the other components (e.g., expected return on assets, interest costs, amortization of gains/losses and prior service costs).  •  Adopted January 1, 2018. •  For further information, refer to Note 1. Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securitiesIssued March 2017  •  Requires amortization of premiums to the earliest call date on debt securities with call features that are explicit, noncontingent and callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. •  Does not impact debt securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to the contractual maturity date.  •  Adopted January 1, 2018. •  For further information, refer to Note 1.Hedge accountingIssued August 2017  •  Aligns the accounting with the economics of the risk management activities. •  Expands the ability for certain hedges of interest rate risk to qualify for hedge accounting. •  Allows recognition of ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges and net investment hedges in OCI.  •  Permits an election at adoption to transfer certain investment securities classified as held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. •  Simplifies hedge documentation requirements.  •  Adopted January 1, 2018. •  For further information, refer to Note 1.Reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI Issued February 2018   •  Permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the TCJA on items within AOCI to retained earnings so that the tax effects of items within AOCI reflect the appropriate tax rate.  •  Adopted January 1, 2018. •  For further information, refer to Note 1.

FASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted      Standard Summary of guidance  Effects on financial statements     LeasesIssued February 2016  •  Requires lessees to recognize all leases longer than twelve months on the Consolidated balance sheets as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset. •  Requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” classification tests. •  Permits the Firm to generally account for its existing leases consistent with current guidance, except for the incremental balance sheet recognition. •  Expands qualitative and quantitative leasing disclosures. •  May be adopted using a modified cumulative effect approach wherein the guidance is applied only to existing contracts as of the date of initial application, and to new contracts transacted after that date, or a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the effective date.  •  Required effective date: January 1, 2019.(a) •  The Firm is in the process of its implementation which includes evaluating its leasing activities and certain contracts for embedded leases, implementing a new lease accounting software solution for its real estate leases, and updating processes and internal controls for its leasing activities. As a lessee, the Firm is developing its estimate of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, which is based on the present value of lease payments. The Firm expects to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset (at their present value) related to predominantly all of the $10 billion of future minimum payments required under operating leases as disclosed in Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. However, the population of contracts subject to balance sheet recognition and their initial measurement remains under evaluation; final financial statement impacts will depend on the lease portfolio at the time of adoption. The Firm does not expect material changes to the recognition of operating lease expense in its Consolidated statements of income.  •  The Firm plans to adopt the new lease guidance on January 1, 2019 and elect the available practical expedients, which will not require it to reassess whether an existing contract contains a lease or whether classification or unamortized initial lease costs would be different under the new lease guidance.Financial instruments – credit lossesIssued June 2016  •  Replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost, which will reflect management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the financial assets. •  Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination.  •  Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. •  Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption.  •  Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a)  •  The Firm has established a Firmwide, cross-discipline governance structure, which provides implementation oversight.  The Firm continues to identify key interpretive issues, and is in the process of developing and implementing current expected credit loss models that satisfy the requirements of the new standard.  •  The Firm expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in its allowance for credit losses due to several factors, including: 1. The allowance related to the Firm’s loans and commitments will increase to cover credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio, and will consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions 2. The nonaccretable difference on PCI loans will be recognized as an allowance, which will be offset by an increase in the carrying value of the related loans3. An allowance will be established for estimated credit losses on non-agency HTM securities •  The extent of the increase in the allowance is under evaluation, but will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Firm’s portfolio at the adoption date, and the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date.   •  The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020.GoodwillIssued January 2017  •  Requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. •  Eliminates the second condition in the current guidance that requires an impairment loss to be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value.  •  Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) •  Based on current impairment test results, the Firm does not expect a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the impact of the new accounting guidance will depend on the performance of the reporting units and the market conditions at the time of adoption. •  After adoption, the guidance may result in more frequent goodwill impairment losses due to the removal of the second condition. •  The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020.
(a)Early adoption is permitted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments, refer to Note 23.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly presented.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.For a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation, refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Application of U.S. GAAP related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and the Firm recorded the estimated impact of the deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings and the remeasurement of deferred taxes under the TCJA. These provisional amounts represent estimates under SEC guidance, which provides a one-year measurement period in which to refine the estimates based on new information or the issuance of interpretative guidance. Based on legislative clarifications published during the second quarter of 2018, which were specific to the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings, the Firm recorded a tax benefit of $189 million. The Firm has made and continues to anticipate refinements to both calculations as a result of the issuance of additional legislative and accounting guidance as well as those in the normal course of business, including true-ups to the tax liability on the tax return as filed and the resolution of tax audits. The Firm considers any legislative or accounting guidance issued as of the balance sheet date when evaluating potential refinements to these estimates.

The most significant of the new standards was revenue recognition, which requires gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change resulted in noninterest revenue and noninterest expense each increasing by $261 million and $525 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, with no impact to net income. Upon adoption of the restricted cash guidance, to align the Consolidated balance sheets with the Consolidated statements of cash flows, the Firm reclassified restricted cash into cash and due from banks or deposits with banks. In addition, for the Firm’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks. This guidance was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised, resulting in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increasing by $71 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, and other assets decreasing by $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017.

(a)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $65.6 billion and $78.0 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included within trading loans were $14.8 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $5.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $9.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of zero and $836 million respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, refer to Note 4. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.(f)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $764 million and $779 million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, were trading assets of $50 million and $54 million, respectively, and other assets of $714 million and $725 million, respectively.(g)Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted the recognition and measurement guidance. Equity securities that were previously reported as AFS securities were reclassified to other assets upon adoption.

Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair
value on a recurring basis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 there were no individually significant transfers. All transfers are based on changes in the observability of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Level 3 valuations For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.  In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at June 30, 2018, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range; equity correlation, equity-FX, and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate, yield and prepayment speed inputs used in estimating fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads and conditional default rates were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; loss severity and price inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.(b)Includes U.S. government agency securities of $471 million, nonagency securities of $88 million and trading loans of $239 million.(c)Includes U.S. government agency securities of $7 million, nonagency securities of $18 million, trading loans of $261 million and non-trading loans of $159 million.(d)Comprises trading loans.(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(f)Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
For a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall  fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
The following tables present the assets still held as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the six months ended June 30,  2018 and 2017, respectively, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

(a)Of the $210 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2018, $166 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 13% to 40% with a weighted average of 22%.(b)Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative) as a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance. Of the $823 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2018, $641 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.There were no material liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2018 and 2017.
Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, related to financial instruments held at those dates.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. (a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, refer to Valuation hierarchy on pages 156–159 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. (b)The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, refer to page 157 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
As a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance and the election of the measurement alternative in the first quarter of 2018, the Firm measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of June 30, 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.(b)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected notes. Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $10.9 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(225) million and $(76) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, and Note 20 of this Form 10-Q.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. Derivatives designated as hedges The adoption of the new hedge accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 better aligns hedge accounting with the economics of the Firm’s risk management activities. For additional information, refer to Note 17. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or  cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For qualifying fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings through an amortization approach over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings. The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: •collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. •the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and •collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features For a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2018, andDecember 31, 2017.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at June 30, 2018 was not material, and there were no such transfers at December 31, 2017.

Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income
The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.
Fair value hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(e)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.(f)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Under the new hedge accounting guidance, the initial amount of the excluded components may be amortized into income over the life of the derivative, or changes in fair value may be recognized in current period earnings.(g)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.As of June 30, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to impact the income statement in future periods (e.g., as adjustments to yield or to securities gains/losses).

(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.2 billion to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Given the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges generally will not impact the income statement in future periods. The carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is $15.4 billion and for long-term debt is $7.2 billion.(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.(d)Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a)Primarily consists of benchmark interest rate hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.(c)Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(54) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2018, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which  forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately five years. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.(b)Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on net investment hedges directly in income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. (c)Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. For additional information, refer to Note 17.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

(a)Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
For a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)Other credit derivatives largely consists of credit swap options.(b)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.(c)Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.(d)Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Note 5 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest
expense
Noninterest revenue
For a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm’s noninterest revenue, refer to Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The adoption of the revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018, requires gross presentation of certain costs previously offset against revenue, predominantly associated with certain distribution costs (previously offset against asset management, administration and commissions), with the remainder associated with certain underwriting costs (previously offset against investment banking fees). Adoption of the guidance did not result in any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition. This guidance was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, which resulted in an increase in both noninterest revenue and noninterest expense. For additional information, refer to Note 1.

Note 9 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At June 30, 2018, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.As a result of the adoption of the premium amortization accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, premiums  on purchased callable debt securities must be amortized to the earliest call date for debt securities with call features that are explicit, noncontingent and callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. The guidance primarily impacts obligations of U.S. states and municipalities held in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. For additional information, refer to Note 17.As permitted by the new hedge accounting guidance, the Firm also elected to transfer U.S. government agency MBS, commercial MBS, and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $22.4 billion from HTM to AFS in the first quarter of 2018. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. For additional information, refer to Note 17.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.

(a)As of June 30, 2018, mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity; the amortized cost and fair value of such securities was $51.3 billion and $51.1 billion, respectively.(b)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)Includes investment securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 7 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, refer to Note 3. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, refer to Note 21.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances  outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces the economic exposure with the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented below, if the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm held $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans •Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair value•PCI loans held-for-investment

For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.
Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.
Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f)Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Residential mortgage(b)• Home equity(c)Other consumer loans(d)• Auto• Consumer & Business Banking(e)Residential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other(g)
(a)Includes loans held in CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate.(b)Predominantly includes prime (including option ARMs) and subprime loans.(c)Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans.(d)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.(e)Predominantly includes Business Banking loans.(f)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.(g)Includes loans to: individuals (predominantly Wealth Management clients within AWM), SPEs, and private education and civic organizations. For more information on SPEs, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

These amounts were not material as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table.

(a)Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.(b)Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $5.3 billion and $5.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $8.9 billion and $11.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(c)Includes the Firm’s student loan portfolio which was sold in 2017.
Gains and losses on sales of loans
Gains and losses on sales of loans (including adjustments to record loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in other income were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. In addition, the sale of loans may result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.

The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. In 2017, the Firm sold its student loan portfolio.

(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion; 30–149 days past due included $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion; and 150 or more days past due included $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.(b)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $4.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.(c)These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, these balances included $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.(d)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(e)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(f)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.


132


Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.
Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate(in millions, except ratios)Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 HELOCs:(a)     Within the revolving period(b)$5,455$6,363 0.26%0.50%Beyond the revolving period12,63113,532 2.723.56HELOANs1,1901,371 2.773.50Total$19,276$21,266 2.03%2.64%
(a)These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty.

HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses.

Impaired loans
The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

(a)Represents collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2018, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 13% of residential mortgages and 9% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due.(b)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.(c)Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S.(d)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.(e)At both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans included $2.2 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.

(a)Generally, interest income on loans modified in TDRs is recognized on a cash basis until the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms, unless the loan is deemed to be collateral-dependent.

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.

The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm.

Nature and extent of modifications
The U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable programs, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.(b)Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Also includes forbearances that meet the definition of a TDR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Forbearances suspend or reduce monthly payments for a specific period of time to address a temporary hardship.

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.At June 30, 2018, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for residential mortgage and 8 years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).  Active and suspended foreclosureAt June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $763 million and $787 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(a)When discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.(b)Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S.(c)Other consumer average impaired loans were $277 million and $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $287 million and $501 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.(d)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.

Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $91 million and $102 million, respectively. New TDRs, as well as the impact of these modifications were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were not material. TDRs on nonaccrual status were $66 million and $72 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

(a)Carrying value includes the effect of fair value adjustments that were applied to the consumer PCI portfolio at the date of acquisition.(b)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(c)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.

The remaining $32 million and $37 million at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed.(e)Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications under long-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were $202 million and $176 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $425 million and $361 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.

(a)Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 32.10% and 31.54% as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind, solar and other alternative energy projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the  general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $13.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, of which $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion was unfunded, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until qualification of the project for tax credits. For further information on affordable housing tax credits, refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20 of this Form 10-Q. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)The Firm may provide various services to Customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to Customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2018 and December 31,  2017 was $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was $8.6 billion and $9.2 million, respectively. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. For a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored
securitization entities
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these  transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 20 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 20, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 11.The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Goodwill Impairment testingFor a further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, refer to Impairment testing on pages 244–245 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2018, or December 31, 2017, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2018 or 2017.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.

151


Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.(c)Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.(d)Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.
(in millions, except rates)Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”)8.43% 9.35%Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change$(195) $(221)Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change(379) (427)Weighted-average option adjusted spread8.72% 9.04%Impact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change$(245) $(250)Impact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change(472) (481)
CPR: Constant prepayment rate.

Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

Note 19 – Regulatory capital
For a detailed discussion on regulatory capital, refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s insured depository institutions (“IDI”), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A.Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table represents the minimum and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2018.

Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a)Represents the Transitional minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018, the CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 2.5% capital conservation buffer and 2.625%, resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 3.5% GSIB surcharge.  (b)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.  (e)For the period ended December 31, 2017, the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 7.5%, 9.0%, 11.0% and 4.0%, and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries were 5.75%, 7.25%, 9.25% and 4.0%, respectively.

Note 20 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank, the Firm in part is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured  clearance advance facilities that the Firm extended to its clients (i.e., cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the Firm’s intra-day credit risk to the facility amount and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of December 31, 2017 the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2018 the Firm no longer offers such arrangements to its clients.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.The following table summarizes the standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 4.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs and in certain private label transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. For additional information, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

161


The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Guarantees of subsidiaryThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary.

Note 22 – Litigation
Contingencies
As of June 30, 2018, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.7 billion at June 30, 2018. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:•the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, •the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, •the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and •the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.American Depositary Receipts Pre-Release Inquiry. The Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division has been investigating depositary banks and broker-dealers, including the Firm, in connection with activity relating to pre-released American Depositary Receipts. The Staff’s investigation focuses on the period of 2011 to 2015. The Firm has been cooperating with this investigation.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX-related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter.The Firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.-based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the “U.S. class action”). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the “exchanged-based actions”), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”), participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the “ERISA actions”), and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions. The Court granted final approval of that settlement agreement in May 2018. Certain members of the settlement class have filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class.

The District Court has dismissed one of the ERISA actions, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that dismissal in July 2018. The District Court has also dismissed the indirect purchaser action, and the plaintiffs have sought leave to replead their complaint. The consumer action and a second ERISA action remain pending in the District Court.General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated Term Loan facility (“Term Loan”) for General Motors Corporation (“GM”). In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (“Creditors Committee”) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal of the Creditors Committee’s claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In connection with that additional collateral, a trial in the Bankruptcy Court regarding the value of certain representative assets concluded in May 2017, and a ruling was issued in September 2017. The Bankruptcy Court found that 33 of the 40 representative assets are fixtures and that these fixtures generally should be valued on a “going concern” basis. The Creditors Committee is seeking leave to appeal the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling that the fixtures should be valued on a “going concern” basis rather than on a liquidation basis. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. seeking indemnification and asserting various claims. The parties have engaged in mediation concerning, among other things, the characterization and value of the remaining additional collateral, in light of the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling regarding the representative assets, as well as other issues, including the cross-claims. In July 2018, the parties informed the Bankruptcy Court that, at this time, they do not believe that they will be able to reach a global settlement of the adversary proceeding through mediation, and that they intend to present the Bankruptcy Court with a proposed schedule for ongoing litigation. The parties will continue to mediate specific disputes involving certain issues, principally relating to whether certain of the additional collateral should be characterized as fixtures. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws. The parties settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement.A number of merchants appealed the settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. In March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined petitions seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. The parties to the class action seeking monetary relief have reached a settlement agreement in principle, subject to documentation and court approval, and are engaged in ongoing negotiations.In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates was submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) during similar time periods, as well as processes for the setting of U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods, including through 2012. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations to the extent that they are ongoing. The Firm has recently reached a resolution with the CFTC concerning the CFTC’s U.S. dollar ISDAFIX-related investigation. As previously reported, the Firm has resolved EC inquiries relating to Yen LIBOR and Swiss Franc LIBOR. In December 2016, the Firm resolved ComCo inquiries relating to these same rates. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various United States District Courts. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation.The Firm has agreed to settle putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts, Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate. Those settlements are all subject to further documentation and court approval.In an action related to EURIBOR, the District Court dismissed all claims except a single antitrust claim and two common law claims, and dismissed all defendants except the Firm and Citibank.In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted antitrust claims, claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims to proceed. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. In February 2018, the District Court (i) granted class certification with respect to certain antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, (ii) denied class certification with respect to state common law claims brought by the holders of those bonds and swaps and (iii) denied class certification with respect to two other putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts and LIBOR-based loans held by plaintiff lending institutions. The Firm and another defendant have petitioned for leave to appeal the class certification of the antitrust claims related to bonds and swaps, and plaintiffs have petitioned for leave to appeal the denial of class certification as to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts. In July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied  the plaintiff lending institutions’ petition for leave to appeal the denial of their motion for class certification.In an action related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, the District Court dismissed without prejudice all claims except a single antitrust claim, and dismissed without prejudice all defendants except the Firm, Bank of America and Citibank. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2017, which the Firm and other defendants have moved to dismiss.The Firm is one of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. In April 2016, the Firm settled this litigation, along with certain other banks. Those settlements have been preliminarily approved by the Court.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3.0 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), were named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates were brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally sought to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. In January 2017, the Court substantially denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss an amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. In October 2017, JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates reached an agreement to settle the litigation brought by the Petters bankruptcy trustees, or their successors, and the receiver for Thomas J. Petters. The settlement has received Court approval.Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. The Firm has been successful in legal challenges made to the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, with respect to the criminal proceedings. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firm is requesting clarification from the Court of Cassation concerning the Court of Appeal’s decision before seeking direction on next steps in the criminal proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.*     *     *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense for litigation and investigations was $0 million and $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 23 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, refer to Segment results below, and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Segment resultsThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the  reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.Business segment capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on pages 88-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1.Net income in 2018 for the business segments reflects the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:Results of Review of Financial StatementsWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of June 30, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 27, 2018, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

A CCP becomes counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement.CDS: Credit default swapsCEO: Chief Executive OfficerCET1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 CapitalCFTC: Commodity Futures Trading CommissionCFO: Chief Financial OfficerChase Bank USA, N.A.: Chase Bank USA, National AssociationCIB: Corporate & Investment BankCIO: Chief Investment OfficeClient deposits and other third party liabilities: Deposits, as well as deposits that are swept to on-balance sheet liabilities (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements) as part of client cash management programs. CLO: Collateralized loan obligationsCLTV: Combined loan-to-value  Collateral-dependent: A loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower’s operations, income or other resources. Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions.Core loans: represents loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit.Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract.

172


to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.ERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974EPS: Earnings per shareExchange-traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.Fannie Mae: Federal National Mortgage AssociationFASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board FCA: Financial Conduct AuthorityFCC: Firmwide Control CommitteeFDIA: Federal Depository Insurance ActFDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationFederal Reserve: The Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemFee share: Proportion of fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

LTIP: Long-term incentive planLTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Origination date LTV ratioThe LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysisMoody’s: Moody’s Investor ServicesMortgage product types:Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.MSA: Metropolitan statistical areasMSR: Mortgage servicing rightsNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net interchange income includes the following components:•Interchange income: A fee paid to a credit card issuer in the clearing and settlement of a sales or cash advance transaction.•Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs.•Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

174


Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningfulNOL: Net operating lossNonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss)OEP: One Equity PartnersOIS: Overnight index swapOPEB: Other postretirement employee benefitOTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairmentOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.PCA: Prompt corrective action PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of  the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.PD: Probability of defaultPRA: Prudential Regulatory AuthorityPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. PSU(s): Performance share units Receivables from customers: primarily represents margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules.REO: Real estate ownedReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Revenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic, a third-party provider of investment banking competitive analysis and volume based league tables for the above noted industry products.RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ROE: Return on equityROTCE: Return on tangible common equityRSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.S&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 IndexSAR(s): Stock appreciation rightsSCCL: Single-counterparty credit limitsScored portfolio: The scored portfolio predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans and certain auto and business banking loans where credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time. The statistical analysis uses portfolio modeling, credit scoring and decision-support tools.SEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.Single-name: Single reference-entitiesSLR: Supplementary leverage ratioSMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securitiesSPEs: Special purpose entities Structural interest rate risk: represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm.Structured notes: Structured notes are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. Where present, the embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk.Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.  Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 121-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls do occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 146 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

Repurchases under the common equity repurchase program
Following receipt in June 2018 of the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to the Firm’s 2018 capital plan, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $20.7 billion of common equity (common stock and warrants) between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity-based compensation plans. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. There were no warrants repurchased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading blackout periods. All purchases under Rule 10b5-1 plans must be made according to predefined plans established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information.The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; maybe executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.

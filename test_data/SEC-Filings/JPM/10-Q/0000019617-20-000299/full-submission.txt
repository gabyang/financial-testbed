Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2020, or $0.78 per share, on net revenue of $28.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 4% and ROTCE of 5%. The Firm recorded a number of significant items in the first quarter of 2020, including an addition to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion, a $951 million loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB predominantly driven by funding spread widening on derivatives, and $896 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB.•Net income was down 69%, predominantly driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses across the Firm reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued pressure on oil prices.•Total net revenue decreased 3%. Net interest income was $14.4 billion, flat versus the prior year, with the impact of lower rates offset by balance sheet growth and mix, as

well as higher net interest income in CIB Markets. Noninterest revenue was $13.8 billion, down 6%. The reduction in revenue included a $951 million loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB predominantly driven by funding spread widening on derivatives and $896 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB; these items were partially offset by higher CIB Markets noninterest revenue. •Noninterest expense was $16.9 billion, up 3%, driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expense and investments, as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by lower structural expense. •The provision for credit losses was $8.3 billion, up $6.8 billion from the prior year driven by the additions to the allowance for credit losses. •The total allowance for credit losses was $25.4 billion at March 31, 2020, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio of 2.32%, compared with 1.43% in the prior year, driven by the additions to allowance for credit losses and the adoption of CECL. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $6.4 billion at March 31, 2020, an increase from $5.6 billion in the prior year, driven by the inclusion of purchased credit deteriorated loans in the mortgage portfolio, which are subject to nonaccrual loan treatment following the adoption of CECL.  •Firmwide end-of-period (“EOP”) loans of $1.0 trillion were up 6% driven by drawdowns on committed revolving credit facilities in March within the wholesale LOBs. Excluding the impact of certain loan sales in Home Lending, EOP loans would have been up 9%. Firmwide average loans were $963 billion, down 1%. Excluding the impact of certain loan sales in Home Lending, average loans would have been up 3%.•On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases through the second quarter of 2020.
Selected capital-related metrics
•The Firm’s CET1 capital was $184 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 11.5% and 12.3%, respectively.•The Firm’s SLR was 6.0%.•The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the first quarter of 2020 at $60.71, up 5% versus the prior year.ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

2020 outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 79 and Risk Factors on page 180 of this Form 10-Q and pages 6–28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in the full year of 2020 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of 2020 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. The outlook information contained in the 2019 Form 10-K, in the Firm’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 25, 2020, containing copies of the slides furnished at the Firm’s 2020 Investor Day, and in the Firm’s Current Reports on Form 8-K dated April 14, 2020, to review 2020 first quarter earnings, is superseded by the information contained in thisForm 10-Q.
Firmwide
•Management expects second quarter 2020 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $14 billion, market dependent. For the full-year 2020, management expects net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $56 billion, market dependent.•Management expects adjusted expense for the full-year 2020 to be below $65 billion.•Management expects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter of 2020. Depending on the extent of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, the additions to the Firm’s allowance for credit losses could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters versus the additions in the first quarter of 2020.

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm established a corporate crisis team (“CCT”) along with crisis response teams that are connected across countries, regions and globally. The CCT includes representation from each LOB and critical functions including Human Resources, Risk and Compliance, Legal, Security and Technology, and it engages directly with the Firm’s Operating Committee on a frequent basis. The CCT provides a central point for the gathering of data which allows for rapid identification and prioritization of issues. The CCT also monitors key operational metrics, risks and concerns on an ongoing basis.  The Firm invoked resiliency plans to allow its businesses to remain operational, utilizing disaster recovery sites and implementing alternative work arrangements globally. The Firm now has more than 180,000 employees globally working from home from every LOB and corporate function, including traders, bankers, portfolio managers, operations, finance, risk and compliance, legal and call center teams globally. The Firm is monitoring the status of work-from-home arrangements and has been updating relevant local authorities as appropriate. Management continues to monitor key operational metrics as well as thematic cross-business risks and concerns.In addition, the Firm implemented strategies and procedures designed to help it respond to increased market volatility, client demand for credit and liquidity, distress in certain industries/sectors and the ongoing impacts to consumers and small businesses.
Supporting clients and customers
The Firm has continued to support its clients and customers as they navigate the challenging conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by providing liquidity and advice. In March 2020, the Firm extended more than $100 billion of new and renewed credit to its clients and customers.•In the wholesale businesses, clients drew more than $50 billion on their committed revolving credit facilities, and the Firm approved over $25 billion of new credit extensions for clients most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first quarter•In the consumer businesses, the Firm extended approximately $20 billion in new credit across Home Lending, Credit Card and Auto.The Firm is actively participating in the Small Business Association’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and as of May 4th the Firm has funded approximately $29 billion under the program.For customers that are experiencing financial hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm developed a payment assistance program to allow mortgage, auto and card customers to delay payments for three months, as well as waiving or refunding certain fees.Three-quarters of the Firm’s branch network continues to operate, ATMs remain accessible and the Firm continues to

provide a wide range of banking services accessible to customers online.
Protecting and supporting employees
In addition to widespread work-from-home arrangements, the Firm has taken further actions to protect and support its employees including;•For employees with jobs that can only be performed on-site, modified business operations, implemented staggered shifts, changed seating arrangements, closed buildings to nonessential visitors and intensified and increased frequency of cleaning of all offices and branches worldwide •Ensured that all branch employees are being paid for their regularly scheduled hours even if those hours are reduced or their branch is temporarily closed•Continued to pay employees who are at home due to potential exposure to the virus or whose health is at higher risk as well as provided paid medical leave to affected employees •Deployed clinical staff internally to support employees •Granted a special payment of up to $1,000 to full- and part-time employees whose jobs require them to continue working on-site and whose annual cash compensation is less than $60,000•Provided all employees with up to five additional paid days off to manage personal needs, which may include dependent care, child care or other issues, as well as offering free COVID-19 related medical treatment for all of the Firm’s U.S. employees and their dependents.
Giving to communities
The Firm has taken steps to help address immediate humanitarian needs and long-term economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the communities in which it operates. To help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities, the Firm has announced a $150 million loan program to deploy capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits, as well as a $50 million philanthropic commitment. An initial $15 million commitment is intended to:•Provide immediate healthcare, food and other humanitarian relief globally•Help existing nonprofit partners around the world that are responding in their communities to the COVID-19 pandemic•Assist small businesses that are vulnerable to economic hardships.
Regulatory actions and programs
Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 10-11 for information concerning relevant regulatory actions and the significant financing programs in which the Firm is participating in order to support its customers and clients.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Firm’s results and operations are discussed throughout this document.

Departure of the U.K. from the EUThe Firm continues to execute on its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program and remains focused on the following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and operational readiness. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has added incremental risk to the program due to the potential impact on execution of changes such as relocation of employees given travel restrictions, or the ability of clients to be operationally ready to the extent that they have diverted resources to address the effects of the pandemic. It has also slowed down the political process to finalize the legal and regulatory framework that will be in place after the transition period that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020, thus lengthening the period of planning uncertainty. Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transitionOn March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and hedge relationships affected by benchmark reform. The Firm expects to apply certain of the practical expedients and is evaluating the timing and application of those elections. Refer to Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 78 for additional information. The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being considered by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and U.S. Treasury Department regarding accounting and tax implications of reference rate reform. The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR discontinuation. Refer to Business Developments on page 47 of the 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 PandemicBeginning in March 2020, the U.S. government as well as central banks around the world have taken a series of actions to help individuals, households and businesses that have been adversely affected by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides, among other things, funding to support loan facilities to assist consumers and businesses. Set forth below is a summary as of the date of this Form 10-Q of U.S. government actions currently impacting the Firm and U.S. government programs in which the Firm is participating to support individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. The Firm will continue to assess ongoing developments in government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.U.S. government actionsEligible retained income definition. On March 17, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), collectively the “federal banking agencies,” issued an interim final rule that revised the definition of “eligible retained income” in the regulatory capital rules that apply to all U.S. banking organizations. On March 23, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that revised the definition of “eligible retained income” for purposes of the total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) buffer requirements that apply to global systemically important banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic limitations on payout distributions that could apply under the agencies’ capital rules or TLAC rule take effect on a more graduated basis in the event that a banking organization’s capital, leverage and TLAC ratios were to decline below regulatory requirements (including buffers). The March 17 interim final rule was issued, in conjunction with an interagency statement encouraging banking organizations to use their capital and liquidity buffers, to further support banking organizations’ abilities to lend to households and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Reserve requirements. On March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions, an action that frees up liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and Note 21 for additional information on the reduction to the reserve requirement.Regulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) transition delay. On March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on  regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). The Firm elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44 and Note 22 on pages 159-160 for additional information on the CECL capital transition provisions and the impact to the Firm’s capital measures.Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary revision. On April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that revises, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions will allow the Firm to continue to support U.S. Treasury markets and to serve as financial intermediaries for households and businesses. This exclusion is effective April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect through March 31, 2021.   Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44 for additional information on the Firm’s SLR.Loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies along with the National Credit Union Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the state financial regulators, issued an interagency statement revising a March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). The IA Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with borrowers where the loans are prudently underwritten, and not considered past due or carried on nonaccrual status, should not result in the loans automatically being considered modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) for accounting and financial reporting purposes, or for purposes of their respective risk-based capital rules, which would otherwise require financial institutions subject to the capital rules to hold more capital. The IA Statement also clarifies the interaction between its previous guidance and Section 4013 of the CARES Act, which provides certain financial institutions the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time for loan modifications made to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The special considerations addressed in the IA Statement and Section 4013 of the CARES Act, if applied, would have had no impact on the accounting for the Firm’s modification activities in the three months ended March 31, 2020 but may be relevant for modifications offered in the future.Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 50-51 and Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s loan modification activities.U.S. government facilities and programs. Beginning in March 2020, the Federal Reserve announced a suite of facilities using its emergency lending powers under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to support the flow of credit to individuals, households and businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the broader economy. These facilities include the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (“MMLF”), Primary Dealer Credit Facility (“PDCF”) and Commercial Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”). The Firm is currently participating in the MMLF and PDCF to support the broader economy by providing liquidity to money market mutual funds and supporting the functioning of the secured financing market, respectively. Under the CPFF, the Firm is acting as a dealer to purchase eligible commercial paper. In addition, beginning April 3, 2020, the PPP, established by the CARES Act and administered by the SBA, authorized eligible lenders to provide nonrecourse loans to small businesses to provide an incentive for these businesses to keep their workers on their payroll. The Firm is currently participating in the PPP to support its small business clients.Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44, Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and Note 22 for additional information of the Firm’s participation in the MMLF. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for additional information of the Firm’s participation in the PDCF. Refer to Business Developments on pages 8-9 for additional information on the Firm’s participation in the PPP.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, unless otherwise specified. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. Refer to pages 75–77 of this Form 10-Q and pages 136–138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations.

(a)  In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.(b)  Included operating lease income of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB,  reflecting:•higher debt underwriting fees driven by both increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in investment-grade bonds, particularly in March, as clients sought to access liquidity,•higher equity underwriting fees driven by increased industry-wide fees primarily in the IPO market, with strong activity in January and February, compared to a weak prior year,•lower advisory fees compared to a strong prior year, driven by a lower number of completed transactions, as well as the impact of delays in regulatory approvals.Refer to CIB segment results on pages 26–30 and Note 6 for additional information.Principal transactions revenue decreased reflecting two significant items: •a $951 million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other predominantly driven by funding spread widening on derivatives, and •$896 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB, as high-yield spreads widened significantly.
largely offset by

Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue increased driven by Fixed Income Markets on strong client activity, primarily in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets, as a result of higher trading volume, and in Equity Markets on strong client activity in derivatives, particularly in March for both businesses.Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis.Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 26–30, pages 34–36 and page 37, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily due to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in customer accounts and transactions, and in CIB and CB from an increase in cash management transactions.Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25, CIB on pages 26–30 and CB on pages 31–33, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased driven by:•higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on higher client-driven volume particularly in March, and •higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB as a result of higher asset values at the beginning of 2020, driven by higher average market levels and strong net inflows into long-term products over the past year, despite the impact of market volatility in March. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 23–25, pages 26–30 and pages 34–36 , respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.Investment securities gains in both periods reflected the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio.  Refer to Corporate segment results on page 37 and Note 10 for additional information.Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:•lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and a lower level of third-party loans serviced, as well as lower MSR risk management results,•higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production volumes and margins, and the absence of a gain on a loan sale in the prior year.Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25, Note 6 and 15 for further information.

Card income decreased driven by lower net interchange income reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, partially offset by higher card sales volume, despite a decline in March.Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25 and Note 6 for further information.Other income decreased reflecting:•losses on certain equity investments in CIB •net valuation losses on certain investments in AWM, compared with gains in the prior year •higher amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments in CIB. The increased amortization is more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits.•higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCBRefer to Note 6 for further information.Net interest income was flat as the impact of lower rates was offset by balance sheet growth and mix, as well as higher CIB Markets net interest income.The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.5 trillion, up $167 billion, and the yield was 3.14%, down 66 bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.37%, a decrease of 20 bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.01%, down 42bps.Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 170 for further details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19–20 for a further discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB markets.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.The provision for credit losses increased driven by additions to both the consumer and wholesale allowance for credit losses.The increase in total consumer was driven by:•additions of $4.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses,  reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of $3.8 billion for Card, $300 million for Home Lending, $235 million for Auto, and $80 million for CBB;•net charge-offs were flat reflecting higher net charge-offs in Card on loan growth, in line with prior expectations, offset by higher recoveries in Home Lending on a current period loan sale.The increase in wholesale reflects a net addition of $2.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs. The net addition was predominantly driven by the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple sectors, and continued pressure on oil prices, with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, and Consumer & Retail industries.Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25, CIB on pages 26–30, CB on pages 31–33, AWM on pages 34–36, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65, and Note 13 for additional information on the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
Consolidated balance sheets analysis
The following is a discussion of the significant changes between March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.
Selected Consolidated balance sheets data(in millions)March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019ChangeAssets    Cash and due from banks$24,001 $21,70411 %Deposits with banks343,533 241,92742Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements248,580 249,157—Securities borrowed139,839 139,758—Trading assets548,580 411,10333Available-for-sale securities399,944 350,69914Held-to-maturity securities, net of allowance for credit losses71,200 47,54050Investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses471,144 398,23918Loans1,015,375 959,7696Allowance for loan losses(23,244) (13,123)77Loans, net of allowance for loan losses992,131 946,6465Accrued interest and accounts receivable122,064 72,86168Premises and equipment25,882 25,813—Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets51,867 53,341(3)Other assets171,810 126,83035Total assets$3,139,431 $2,687,37917 %
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increased primarily as a result of significant deposit inflows, which also funded asset growth across the Firm. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements was flat as the reduction in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO was offset by an increase in client-driven market-making activities and higher collateral requirements as a result of changes in market conditions in March, as well as higher demand for securities to cover short positions when compared with lower levels at year-end in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and Note 11 for additional information.Trading assets increased, reflecting growth in client-driven market-making activities in CIB, predominantly debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets and when compared with lower levels at year-end, as well as higher derivative receivables in CIB as a result of market movements, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.Investment securities increased, reflecting:•in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio, net purchases of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries driven by interest rate risk management activities, partially offset by a non-cash transfer of $26.1 billion of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS from the AFS to the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio, resulting in a comparable increase in HTM.

Refer to Corporate segment results on page 37, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 66, and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on Investment securities.Loans increased predominantly reflecting drawdowns on committed revolving credit facilities in March in CIB, CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction in Card due to seasonality and a decline in sales volume in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The allowance for loan losses increased driven by:•additions of $5.9 billion, consisting of –$4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in Credit Card, reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and –a net $1.6 billion in wholesale, primarily reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple sectors, and continued pressure on oil prices, with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, and Consumer & Retail industries, and •a net $4.2 billion addition as a result of the adoption of CECL. There were also additions to the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, of $858 million related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued pressure on oil prices, and $98 million related to the adoption of CECL, resulting in total additions to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2020.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 50–66, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased predominantly driven by higher client receivables in CIB during a period of heightened market volatility.Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles decreased reflecting lower MSRs as a result of faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the realization of expected cash flows, partially offset by net additions to the MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for additional information. Other assets increased reflecting higher cash collateral placed with central counterparties during a period of heightened market volatility, and the Firm’s participation in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s (“FRBB”) MMLF. The assets purchased from money market mutual fund clients related to the MMLF were funded by nonrecourse advances from the FRBB, which are recorded in short-term borrowings. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 10-11 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for additional information.
Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued) (in millions)March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019ChangeLiabilities    Deposits$1,836,009 $1,562,43118 %Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements233,207 183,67527Short-term borrowings51,909 40,92027Trading liabilities184,196 119,27754Accounts payable and other liabilities253,874 210,40721Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”)19,630 17,84110Long-term debt299,344 291,4983Total liabilities2,878,169 2,426,04919Stockholders’ equity261,262 261,330—Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$3,139,431 $2,687,37917 %
Deposits increased driven by significant inflows in CIB, CB and AWM as clients focused on increasing their cash balances as a result of changes in market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Deposits also increased in CCB due to seasonal growth in existing and new accounts.Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and Notes 2 and 16 for additional information.Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased from client-driven market-making activities as a result of changes in market conditions in March and higher financing of trading assets-debt instruments when compared with lower levels at year-end in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and Note 11 for additional information.Short-term borrowings increased driven by the Firm’s participation in the FRBB’s MMLF. The nonrecourse advances from the FRBB funded the assets purchased from money market mutual fund clients related to the MMLF, which are recorded in other assets. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 10-11 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for additional information.Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-making activities in CIB, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in both debt and equity instruments in Markets, as well as higher derivative payables as a result of market movements, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting higher client payables related to client-driven activities in CIB during a period of heightened market volatility.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased due to higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper issued to third parties, partially offset by activity in municipal bond vehicles.Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 18 and Notes 14 and 23 for further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.Long-term debt increased as a result of•higher FHLB advances and an increase in senior debt reflecting fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to lower interest rates, partially offset by net maturities in Treasury and CIO,partially offset by•a decrease in the fair value of structured notes in CIB related to market movements in March.Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt activities.Stockholders’ equity was flat reflecting the net impact of capital actions, net income, the adoption of CECL and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The increase in AOCI was driven by higher valuation of interest rate cash flow hedges, debit valuation adjustment on fair value option-elected liabilities, and net unrealized gains on AFS securities. Refer to page 83 for information on changes in stockholders’ equity and Capital actions on pages 42–43.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).
Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees.The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 80–84.In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:•Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis)

•Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense•Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets businesses•Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS•Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 57–59 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19–20 for a definition of managed basis.Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Revenue sharing When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue and expense are generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on business segment capital allocation. Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.
Business segment changes
In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises:•Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB•Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB.In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

Quarterly results
Net income was $191 million, a decrease of 95%, predominantly driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $13.2 billion, a decrease of 2%. Net interest income was $9.2 billion, down 3%, driven by:•the impact of deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth in deposit balances in CBB, and•lower loan balances in Home Lending predominantly due to prior year loan sales,•higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card.Noninterest revenue was $4.0 billion, down 2%, driven by:•lower card income due to lower net interchange income reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, partially offset by higher card sales volume, despite a decline in March, and•lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and a lower level of third-party loans serviced, as well as lower MSR risk management results,predominantly offset by •higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production volumes and margins, and the absence of a gain on a loan sale in the prior year, •higher auto lease volume, and•higher deposit-related fees.Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 3%, driven by:•higher volume- and revenue-related expense, including depreciation on auto lease assets, and investments in the business, partially offset by•lower structural expense.The provision for credit losses was $5.8 billion, an increase of $4.5 billion, driven by additions to the allowance for credit losses reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of:•$3.8 billion for Card, $300 million for Home Lending, $250 million for Auto and $159 million in CBB•net charge-offs were flat reflecting higher net charge-offs in Card on loan growth, in line with prior expectations, offset by higher recoveries in Home Lending on a current period loan sale.Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Net income was $2.0 billion, down 39%, predominantly driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $9.9 billion, down 1%.Banking revenue was $2.6 billion, down 24%.•Investment Banking revenue was $886 million, down 49%, predominantly driven by $820 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio as high-yield spreads widened significantly. The decline was partially offset by higher Investment Banking fees, up 3%. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.–Debt underwriting fees were $1.1 billion, up 15%, driven by both increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in investment-grade bonds, particularly in March as clients sought to access liquidity.–Equity underwriting fees were $331 million, up 25%,  driven by increased industry-wide fees primarily in the IPO market, with strong activity in January and February, compared to a weak prior year.–Advisory fees were $503 million, down 22%, compared to a strong prior year, driven by a lower number of completed transactions as well as the impact of delays in regulatory approvals.•Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.4 billion, down 4%, driven by a reporting re-classification for certain expenses which are now reported as contra revenue in Merchant Services. In addition, deposit margin

Markets revenue was $7.2 billion, up 32%.•Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, up 34%, driven by strong client activity across products primarily in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets reflecting higher trading volume particularly in March.•Equity Markets revenue was $2.2 billion, up 28%, driven by strong client activity in derivatives and higher revenue in Cash Equities, particularly in March.•Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6%, predominantly driven by deposit balance and fee growth partially offset by deposit margin compression.•Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $951 million, predominantly driven by funding spread widening on derivatives.Noninterest expense was $5.9 billion, up 5%, driven by higher legal expense, volume- and revenue-related expenses and investments in the business, partially offset by lower structural expense.The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, compared with $87 million in the prior year. The increase was predominantly driven by additions to the allowance for credit losses from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple sectors and continued pressure on oil prices, with the largest impact in the Oil & Gas and Consumer & Retail industries.Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are  recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 69 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information.For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

In the first quarter of 2020, CIB Markets had two loss days. Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk (“VaR”) measure and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 67–69.

Quarterly results
Net income was $147 million, a decrease of 86%, predominantly driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $2.2 billion, down 10%. Net interest income was $1.6 billion, down 7%, driven by lower deposit margins, partially offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $621 million, a decrease of 15%, driven by markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio, and lower investment banking revenue, partially offset by higher deposit-related fees.Noninterest expense was $988 million, up 5%, predominantly driven by investments in the business. The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, compared with $90 million in the prior year. The increase was predominantly driven by additions to the allowance for credit losses from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple sectors and continued pressure on oil prices, with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, and Consumer & Retail industries.Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly results
Net income was $664 million, flat versus the prior year.Net revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3%. Net interest income of $897 million was flat, reflecting deposit and loan growth, offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue was $2.7 billion, up 4%, largely driven by: •higher asset management fees as a result of higher asset values at the beginning of 2020 driven by higher average market levels, and strong net inflows into long-term products over the past year despite the impact of market volatility in March, and •increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven volume particularly in March,•net valuation losses on certain investments, compared with gains in the prior year.Revenue from Asset Management was $1.7 billion, down 1%, driven by:•net valuation losses on certain investments, compared with gains in the prior year, •higher asset management fees as a result of higher average market levels, despite the impact of market volatility in March. Revenue from Wealth Management was $1.9 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by:•increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven volume particularly in March,•deposit and loan growth, and •higher asset management fees as a result of higher average market levels and strong net inflows into long-term products over the past year, despite the impact of market volatility in March, partially offset by•deposit margin compression.Noninterest expense of $2.7 billion was flat, as higher investments and volume-and revenue-related expense, were predominantly offset by lower structural expense.The provision for credit losses was $94 million, driven by additions to the allowance for credit losses from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as loan growth.Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Net revenue was $166 million, compared with $425 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, largely offset by higher noninterest revenue primarily due to higher net investment securities gains reflecting the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio, and market-driven impacts on certain Corporate investments.Noninterest expense of $146 million was down $65 million due to lower structural expense, largely offset by a lower net legal benefit compared to the prior year.The current period income tax expense was driven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes and more specifically, the impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year expected tax rate relative to the level of pretax income for the quarter.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: •Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; •Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and •Firmwide structures for risk governance. The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

Risk governance and oversight functions
The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2019 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. Refer to pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K, Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and stress testing.COVID-19 PandemicThe Firm remains well-capitalized, but has been impacted by recent market events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuation or further deterioration of the current macroeconomic environment could result in additional impacts to the Firms capital and leverage position. Basel III OverviewThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies (“BHC”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.  Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information. Key Regulatory DevelopmentsCurrent Expected Credit Losses. As disclosed in the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”).The interim final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss model during the first two years of the transition period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2020, the capital measures of the Firm exclude $4.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $6.8 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions on Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure have also been incorporated into the Firm’s capital measures. Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance. Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. On March 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve established a facility, authorized through September 30, 2020, to enhance the liquidity and functioning of money markets. Under the MMLF, the FRBB makes nonrecourse advances to participating financial institutions to purchase certain types of assets from eligible money market mutual fund clients. These assets, which are reflected in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, are pledged to the FRBB as collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to neutralize the effects of purchasing assets through the program on risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios. As of March 31, 2020 the Firm excluded assets purchased from money market mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF in the amount of $12.0 billion from its RWA and $1.2 billion from adjusted average assets and total leverage exposure. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 pandemic on pages 10-11 for additional information on regulatory actions and significant financing programs that the U.S. government and regulators have introduced to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress Capital Buffer.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule introducing a stress capital buffer (“SCB”) framework for the Basel III Standardized approach that is designed to more closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in CCAR with the ongoing minimum capital requirements for BHCs under the U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule replaces the static 2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer in the Standardized approach with a dynamic institution-specific SCB. The final rule does not apply to the Advanced approach capital requirements. The SCB requirement for BHCs will be effective on October 1 of each year and is expected to remain in effect until September 30 of the following year. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve will disclose the Firm’s SCB requirement and summary information regarding the Firm’s stress test results by June 30, 2020. Starting on October 1, 2020, the SCB will take effect based on the 2020 CCAR submission and will be integrated into the Firm’s ongoing minimum capital requirements.  The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital measures under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 93–98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%. For additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows, refer to page 94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports.The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the finalized LCR framework.

(b)Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.(c)HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.(d)Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in CIB market activities and long-term debt maturities. Liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the quarter primarily due to deposits net of loan growth. Deposits increased in March as a result of market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced reserve requirements to zero percent, which increased JPMorgan

Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA by approximately $25 billion. However, these increases in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule. Refer to Note 21 for additional information. The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the prior year period, primarily from an increase in the average amount of reportable HQLA as a result of increased cash from unsecured long-term debt issuances. The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sourcesIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, as described above. The fair value of these securities was approximately $432 billion and $315 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, however, the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2019, due to an increase in excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an increase in CIB trading assets during the quarter.The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $317 billion and $322 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks.  Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of  unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Parent company or the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.
Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB, the deposit balances as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, and the average deposit balances for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(a)In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The prior-   period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.
Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.Average deposits across the Firm increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020. CIB deposits increased largely driven by continued growth in client activity. CB deposits increased predominantly driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits. AWM deposits increased largely driven by growth in time deposits. Average balances for CIB, CB and AWM were also impacted by net inflows in the month of March as a result of market conditions driven by COVID-19 pandemic concerns. CCB deposits increased driven by continued growth in new accounts. Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 21–37 and pages 15-16, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, from client-driven market-making activities as a result of changes in market conditions in March and higher financing of trading assets-debt instruments when compared with lower levels at year-end in CIB.The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.As of March 31, 2020, the Firm has participated in several of the U.S. government facilities, including the MMLF. The secured nonrecourse advances under the MMLF are included  in other borrowed funds. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39-44 for additional information on the MMLF. In addition, the Firm is participating in the PDCF established by the Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020, which allows primary dealers to support smooth market functioning by facilitating the availability of credit to businesses and households. Under the PDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) provides collateralized financing on a term basis to primary dealers. At March 31, 2020, these financing transactions were reported as securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The PDCF will remain available to primary dealers for at least six months, or longer if conditions warrant. The Firm also continues to participate in the Federal Reserve’s open market operations.The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2020, from December 31, 2019, was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.

47


Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further description of the client-driven loan securitizations.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it  maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 18, and liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2020, except as noted below, were as follows:

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to pages 50–65 for a further discussion of Credit Risk. Refer to page 66 for a further discussion of Investment Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 100–118 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s Credit and Investment Risk Management framework.


CREDIT PORTFOLIO
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 23, and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables, including the Firm’s accounting policies.Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52-55 and Note 12 for further discussions of the consumer credit environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 56-63 and Note 12 as well as the wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies along with the National Credit Union Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the state  financial regulators, issued an interagency statement revising a March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). The IA Statement reconfirmed that supervised institutions will not be directed to automatically categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), including short-term and other insignificant modifications such as payment delays, fee waivers and extensions of repayment terms, and modifications or other programs mandated by the federal or state governments. The IA Statement also provides that loans that were current prior to these modifications should generally not be reported as past due or nonaccrual. Additionally, the IA Statement outlines accounting and reporting considerations for eligible loan modifications for which a financial institution elects to apply the CARES Act and forgo TDR accounting.The Firm’s initial response to many borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic included offering loan modifications, such as 90-day payment delays and waiving or refunding certain fees. These modifications are intended to mitigate adverse affects on borrowers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instances of these modifications will likely rise over the course of the second quarter of 2020. The effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping borrowers recover and mitigating credit losses remains uncertain in light of the unpredictable nature and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the Firm’s initial short-term payment delays and other insignificant modifications was not material to the performance of and credit-related information for the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios during the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO
The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. Refer to Note 12 for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 23 for further information on lending-related commitments.Recent deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses. As of March 31, 2020, the impacts of the macroeconomic environment have had only a limited impact to consumer credit performance. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the scored credit portfolios held in CCB, AWM and Corporate.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances decreased from December 31, 2019 due to lower residential real estate loans, predominantly driven by loan sales. Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2019 driven by paydowns and loan sales in Home Lending, largely offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were higher when compared with the same period in the prior year as the current quarter benefited from a recovery on a loan sale.The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $27.9 billion at March 31, 2020. This amount included $10.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $9.0 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $22.8 billion and $22.5 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was in line with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same period.The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio was relatively flat when compared with December 31, 2019, as paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans were predominantly offset by new originations. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.41% and 0.50% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate loans.
Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified loans accounted for as PCI loans prior to the adoption of CECL. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs.

Credit cardTotal credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2019 due to seasonality and a decline in sales volume in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The March 31, 2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.96% and 1.02%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2019 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and 0.95%, respectively due to the decline in credit card loans noted above. Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 when compared with the same period in the prior year due to loan growth, in line with prior expectations.Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies.Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loansRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.Modifications of credit card loansAt both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Firm had $1.5 billion of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 58–61 for further information.The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied for determining the allowance for credit losses.Recent deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and pressure on oil prices resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate and Consumer and Retail industries. As of March 31, 2020, the impacts of the macroeconomic environment have had only a limited impact to the overall credit profile, with the investment-grade percentage at 73% versus 74% at December 31, 2019. However, criticized exposure increased $6.6 billion from December 31, 2019 to $21.7 billion at March 31, 2020, but remains at relatively low levels compared to the overall size of the portfolio. The increase was largely driven by downgrades in Oil & Gas resulting from lower oil prices and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and in Consumer & Retail primarily due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including investment-grade percentages, as well as to criticized and nonperforming exposures and charge-offs.Retained loans increased by $73.6 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2020, predominantly driven by the CIB and CB, largely to commercial and industrial clients, and predominantly driven by drawdowns on committed revolving credit facilities, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in unfunded lending-related commitments. These drawdowns, which were driven by increased activity in March that returned to more normalized levels in April, were largely made by investment-grade clients, and can be broadly attributed to:•companies in industries directly and immediately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic;•stress in the commercial paper funding markets, and

•preemptive drawdowns by companies concerned about the potential longer term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their cash flows and access to liquidity.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.  The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $21.7 billion at March 31, 2020, compared with $15.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was largely driven by downgrades in Oil & Gas resulting from lower oil prices and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and downgrades in Consumer & Retail primarily due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.Below are summaries of the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas exposure was $42.8 billion as of March 31, 2020, including $21.5 billion of Exploration & Production and Oilfield Services as shown in the table below. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the investment-grade portion of the Oil & Gas portfolio decreased from 53% to 52%, and the drawn percentage of this portfolio increased from 31% to 37%, both driven by lower oil prices and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, criticized exposure increased by $2.6 billion from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 to $4.2 billion at March 31, 2020, also driven by lower oil prices and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 12 for a further discussion on loans, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter of 2020 reflects select downgrades across a number of sectors, including Oil & Gas.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 23 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.
Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers primarily represent held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such no allowance for credit losses is held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of derivative contracts.The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.
Derivative receivables  (in millions)March 31, 2020December 31, 2019Total, net of cash collateral81,64849,766Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(a)(26,178)(16,009)Total, net of collateral$55,470$33,757
(a)Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting agreements.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $81.6 billion and $49.8 billion at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from market movements, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $26.2 billion and $16.0 billion at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative contracts subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 86% and 90% at March 31, 2020,  and December 31, 2019, respectively. Credit derivativesThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information.The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises:•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the balance sheet,•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the balance sheet in accounts payable and other liabilities, and•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the balance sheet.Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses increased compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting:•additions of $6.8 billion associated with the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued pressure on oil prices including:–$4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in Credit Card, reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and–a net $2.4 billion in wholesale, primarily reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple sectors, and continued pressure on oil prices, with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, and Consumer & Retail industries, and•a net $4.3 billion addition as a result of the adoption of CECL.In light of the rapidly evolving economic conditions and forecasts during March 2020, management updated its macroeconomic forecast near the end of its credit loss estimation process in early April. This macroeconomic forecast included a decline in the U.S. real GDP of approximately 25% and an increase in the U.S. unemployment rate to above 10%, both in the second quarter, followed by a solid recovery in the second half of 2020. In addition, the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments reflect the estimated impact of the Firm’s payment relief actions as well as the federal government’s stimulus programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 75–77 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–55, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 56–63 and Note 12 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.

64


The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2020, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $469.1 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on page 37 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 67–71 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for further information on related liquidity risk. Principal investment riskPrincipal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments span multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. In general, new principal investments include tax-oriented investments, as well as investments made to enhance or accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The carrying values of the principal investment portfolios have not been significantly affected by recent market events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the event that deterioration of the macroeconomic environment accelerates and/or economic recovery becomes delayed, certain principal investments could be subject to impairments, write-downs, or other negative impacts.As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $23.8 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments) of $18.2 billion at the end of both periods, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $5.6 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively.Refer to page 118 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 119–126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. COVID-19 Pandemic   Market Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and may be limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur, such as those observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 74.Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. This is increasingly important in periods of sustained, heightened market volatility.   Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals.Refer to page 121 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at:(http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm) for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages 124-126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm.The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a)Average portfolio VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated.(b)Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.Average VaR across the risk types and LOBs were generally higher due to increased volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Quarter over quarter resultsAverage total VaR increased by $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared with the prior quarter. This reflects substantial increases in volatility which occurred towards the end of the quarter, affecting the fixed income risk type. Maximum VaR for the quarter was $164 million, also driven by the increased volatility.Year over year resultsAverage total VaR increased by $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the same period in the prior year. This reflects an increase in the fixed income risk type driven by substantial increases in volatility,  and increased exposure in the equities risk type due to the inclusion of Tradeweb following its IPO in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by the exit of certain CIB investments. The fixed income and equities risk type increases were partially offset by reduced exposure in the foreign exchange risk type.In addition, average CCB VaR has increased by $5 million, driven by MSR risk management activities.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-based measures. This change was made to more appropriately align the risk from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities in a single market risk measure. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2020 would have been higher by $6 million and each of the components would have been higher by the amounts reported in the following table:

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s revenue results as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.For the 12 months ended March 31, 2020, the Firm observed 15 VaR backtesting exceptions and posted backtesting gains on 140 of the 260 days. The Firm observed eight VaR backtesting exceptions, due to volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and posted backtesting gains on 44 of the 64 days, for three months ended March 31, 2020. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days differ from the two loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in the CIB Markets revenue results, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue results, refer to page 29.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K.Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience.•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized deposit betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to 2020 Outlook on page 7 for additional information).The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.
(in billions)March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019Parallel shift:   +100 bps shift in rates$2.8 $0.3Steeper yield curve:   +100 bps shift in long-term rates1.5 1.2Flatter yield curve:   +100 bps shift in short-term rates1.4 (0.9)
The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.The Firm’s sensitivity to an upward shift in short-term and long-term rates reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower rates.Based upon current and implied market rates as of March 31, 2020, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. In a negative rate environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require additional management judgment.
The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.
(in billions)March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019Parallel shift:   +100 bps shift in rates$0.4 $0.5Flatter yield curve:   +100 bps shift in short-term rates0.4 0.5
The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the table Predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.Refer to pages 127–128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management.COVID-19 PandemicCountry Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on countries to which the Firm has exposure, leveraging existing stress testing, exposure reporting, controls and tailored analysis.Risk ReportingThe following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2020 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2019. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The overall increase in top 20 exposures was largely driven by client activity and demand for liquidity, relative to the period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an increase in cash placements primarily with the central banks of Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia. In addition, the Firm held a larger inventory in Brazilian government bonds.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to Operational Risk Management on pages 129-131 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Operational Risk Management.Subcategories and examples of operational risksOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 132, Conduct Risk Management on page 133, Legal Risk Management on page 134 and Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for more information. Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided below.Business and Technology Resiliency RiskBusiness disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics. The safety of the Firm’s employees and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption. The program includes governance, awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and after various events. COVID-19 PandemicThe Firm’s Technology and Cybersecurity operations continue to monitor the Firm’s systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week including responding to threat activity using COVID-19 themes in phishing and other social engineering campaigns.The Technology function is actively supporting the Firm’s response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Firm’s expanded use of remote collaboration tools and platforms. Technology diligently monitors the operational performance of the Firm’s infrastructure to support increased market volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

73



ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions, measurement of risk, sizing the allowance for credit losses, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, and making business decisions.While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical macroeconomic environments upon which the models were calibrated, as the Firm has experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods.   Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 75–77 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations and Model Risk Management section on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost, certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments and investment securities. The allowance for credit losses comprises:•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s policies, methodologies, and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. In light of the rapidly evolving economic conditions and forecasts during March 2020, management updated its macroeconomic forecast near the end of its credit loss estimation process in early April. However, changes in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates regarding economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that will affect borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending portfolios, and significant judgment is required to estimate the severity and duration of the current economic

downturn, as well as its potential impact on borrower defaults and loss severities. In particular, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain highly uncertain, and it is difficult to predict exactly how borrower behavior will be impacted by these changes in economic conditions. The effectiveness of government support, customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits should act as mitigants to credit losses, but the extent of the mitigation impact remains uncertain. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using two of the five different macroeconomic scenarios considered in the quantitative calculations used in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. Each scenario included a full suite of macroeconomic variables, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. The maximum difference in macroeconomic variables between the two scenarios over the eight-quarter forecast period was represented by an approximate 3.5% deterioration in U.S. real GDP, an approximate 250 basis point increase in the U.S. unemployment rate, and an approximate 10.5% deterioration in the national house price index. This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:•the changes in the macroeconomic variables are not intended to imply management’s expectation of the extent or nature of future deterioration in macroeconomic variables•the impacts of changes in many macroeconomic variables are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables•the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic variables at a speed and to degrees not seen in recent history, adding increased uncertainty around credit loss estimates•significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of government support and

75


customer relief, and the speed of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described belowTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts, the difference between these two scenarios would have generated the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of March 31, 2020, without considering any offsetting or correlated effects in other components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures:•An increase of approximately $0.9 billion for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments•An increase of approximately $1.5 billion for credit card loans•An increase of approximately $0.8 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitmentsThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as they do not reflect any potential changes in the adjustment to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2020.



Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

(a)For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $9.7 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.
Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of

76


observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty, as was experienced in the period ended March 31, 2020, judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment.Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2020.Credit card rewards liabilityThe credit card rewards liability was $6.7 billion and $6.4 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to pages 137-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and judgments associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.Income taxesRefer to Income taxes on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes.Litigation reservesRefer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2020     Standard Summary of guidance  Effects on financial statements     Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)Issued June 2016  •  Establishes a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. •  Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to the allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, with a corresponding increase in the amortized cost of the related loans.  •  Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral-dependent assets). •  Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. •  Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. •Adopted January 1, 2020.•Refer to Note 1 for further information.GoodwillIssued January 2017  •  Requires recognition of an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. •  Eliminates the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. •Adopted January 1, 2020.•No impact upon adoption as the guidance is to be applied prospectively.•Refer to Note 15 for further information.Reference Rate ReformIssued March 2020  •  Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedging relationships, and other transactions are amended due to reference rate reform. •  Provides an election to account for certain contract amendments related to reference rate reform as modifications rather than extinguishments without the requirement to assess the significance of the amendments. •  Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedging relationship without automatic termination of that relationship. Provides various practical expedients and elections designed to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted during the transition period. •  Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met.  •Issued and effective March 12, 2020. •The Firm expects to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships and is evaluating the timing and application of those elections.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 26 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly presented.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K.Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form     10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.

Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)
The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 13 for further information.
The following table presents the impacts to the allowance for credit losses and retained earnings upon adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2020:
(in billions)December 31, 2019CECL adoption impactJanuary 1, 2020Allowance for credit losses   Consumer, excluding credit card(a)$2.6$0.4$3.0Credit card5.75.511.2Wholesale(a)6.0(1.6)4.4Firmwide$14.3$4.3$18.6    Retained earnings   Firmwide allowance increase $4.3 Balance sheet reclassification(b) (0.8) Total pre-tax impact 3.5 Tax effect (0.8) Decrease to retained earnings $2.7
(a)In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Accordingly, $0.6 billion of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 and $(0.2) billion of the CECL adoption impact were reclassified.
(b)Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable difference on purchased credit deteriorated loans and the Firm's election to recognize the reserve for uncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in the allowance, both of which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans.
Securities Financing Agreements
As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. The difference between their carrying amount and fair value was immaterial and was recorded as part of the Firm’s cumulative-effect adjustment. Refer to Note 11 for further information.
Investment securities
Upon adoption, HTM securities are presented net of an allowance for credit losses. The guidance also amended the previous other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance. Refer to Note 10 for further information.

Credit quality disclosuresAs a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm expanded credit quality disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost particularly within the retained loan portfolios. Refer to Note 12 for further information.PCD loansThe adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm recognized the nonaccretable difference on PCD loans in the allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans. PCD loans are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies and are now reported in the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio’s residential real estate loan class. Refer to Note 12 for further information.Changes in credit portfolio segments and classesIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portoflio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. The Firm also revised its loan classes. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 12 for further information.Accrued interest receivablesAs permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to continue classifying accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, and investment securities in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest is recognized in the loan balances as it is billed, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans and securities, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.Capital transition provisionsAs disclosed in the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(a)At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $161.2 billion and $104.5 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.(b)At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included within trading loans were $15.9 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $8.9 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities

inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $659 million and $684 million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, were trading assets of $47 million and $54 million, respectively, and other assets of $612 million and $630 million, respectively.
(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.(b)Comprises U.S. GSEs and government agency securities of $519 million, nonagency securities of $24 million and trading loans of $599 million.(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $3 million, trading loans of $223 million and non-trading loans of $283 million.(d)Comprises trading loans.(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(f)Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments  typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
Level 3 assets, including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were 0.6% of total Firm assets at March 31, 2020. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2019, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 96 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Three months ended March 31, 2020
Level 3 assets were $19.2 billion at March 31, 2020, reflecting an increase of $5.6 billion from December 31, 2019 reflective of heightened market volatility and net transfers largely due to:•$2.0 billion increase in trading loans.•$3.1 billion increase in gross equity derivative receivables.•$1.4 billion decrease in MSRs. Refer to the sections below for additional information.
Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis
For the three months ended March 31, 2020, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:•$2.1 billion of total debt and equity instruments, predominantly trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability.•$1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.7 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs.For the three months ended March 31, 2020, there were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.  For the three months ended March 31, 2019, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2.All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.

Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 92–95 for further information on these instruments.
Three months ended March 31, 2020
•$1.2 billion of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs. •$4.6 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by market movements in long-term debt.
Three months ended March 31, 2019
•$505 million of net gains on assets, none of which were individually significant.
•$1.5 billion of net losses on liabilities predominantly driven by market movements in long-term debt.

Of the $334 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2020, $194 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.(b)Represents at March 31, 2020 the markdowns associated with $9.4 billion of held-for-sale positions related to unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2019.(c)Primarily includes certain mortgage loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale.(d)Of the $559 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2020, $294 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 16% to 46% with a weighted average of 28%.
Nonrecurring fair value changes

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life.  The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(b)Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and markdowns associated with held-for-sale positions related to unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 156 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: •Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments•Certain securities financing agreements•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument •Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of client-driven activities •Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value
Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a)There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.(b)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $7.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(97) million and $(94) million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K, and Note 23 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments. The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation.

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite.In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.  The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.

101


The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale-related credit exposure by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The wholesale industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.(g)Excludes cash placed with banks of $354.4 billion and $254.0 billion, at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.(h)Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge  accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: •collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount; •the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and •collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, atMarch 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a)Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.
(b)Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.
Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income
The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.
Fair value hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.7 billion and $6.5 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $16.7 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $1.9 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.(d)Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date.
(e)Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $57 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at March 31, 2020, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately ten years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b)Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. There were no sales or liquidations of legal entities that resulted in reclassifications in the periods presented.


Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

(a)Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.(b)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.(c)Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.
(d)Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Note 10 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance, which also amended the AFS  securities impairment guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.During the first quarter of 2020, the Firm transferred $26.1 billion of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. These securities were transferred at fair value in a non-cash transaction. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $1.0 billion on the securities at the date of transfer.

At March 31, 2020, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the  economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PDs and LGDs) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.
AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $949 million and $264 million, at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

As a result of the adoption of the amended AFS securities impairment guidance, an allowance for credit losses on AFS securities is required for impaired securities if a credit loss exists.AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable). The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss recognized in earnings is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable and net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the securities. For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security.When assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.  For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.Unrealized losses on AFS securities increased during the first quarter of 2020 due to credit spread widening amid volatile financial markets in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was largely related to collateralized loan obligations which had gross unrealized losses of $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2020. Over 99% of these collateralized loan obligations are rated “AAA”, and the average credit enhancement was 37%. Credit enhancement in collateralized loan obligations is primarily in the form of overcollateralization, which is the excess of the par amount of collateral over the par amount of securities. Management assessed the projected collateral performance and the structural protections of these securities including underlying loan defaults and loss severity to determine if a credit loss exists. Based on this assessment, the Firm believes the unrealized losses on collateralized loan obligations are not due to credit losses. Allowance for credit lossesBased on its assessment, the Firm did not recognize an allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of January 1 or March 31, 2020.

120


HTM securities – credit riskThe adoption of the CECL accounting guidance requires management to estimate expected credit losses on HTM securities over the remaining expected life and recognize this estimate as an allowance for credit losses. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm recognized an allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities of $10 million as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.Credit quality indicatorThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At March 31, 2020, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 92% rated AAA.Allowance for credit lossesThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable). The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable) and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security. The use of different inputs, estimates or methodologies could change the amount of the allowance for credit losses estimated by the Firm.The application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $19 million as of March 31, 2020, reflecting $9 million recognized in the provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.
(b)Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 4 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Credit risk mitigation practicesSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 24 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but  such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Firm held $581 million and $743 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)•Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair valueEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories:
Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest is recognized in the loan balances as it is billed, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.
Nonaccrual loans
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for

certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.
Allowance for loan losses
The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.
Charge-offs
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due.Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: •Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.

126


•Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). •Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the estimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every twelve months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.

Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at fair value Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.  Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

127


Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The Firm’s initial response to many borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic included offering loan modifications, such as 90-day payment delays and waiving or refunding certain fees. These initial short-term and other insignificant modifications were not considered concessions and, therefore, do not result in the related loans being considered TDRs.Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific  allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.

128


Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm revised its classes of loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation:•The consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment’s residential mortgage and home equity loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into a residential real estate class.•Upon adoption of CECL, the Firm elected to discontinue the pool-level accounting for PCI loans and to account for these loans on an individual loan basis. PCI loans are considered PCD loans under CECL and are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies. PCD loans are now reported in the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment’s residential real estate class.•Risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB were reclassified from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment, to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. The remaining scored auto and business banking loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into an auto and other class.•The wholesale portfolio segment’s classes, previously based on the borrower’s primary business activity, have been revised to align with the loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan’s collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.
The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: •For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660 ) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.•For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.

(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $15 million and $17 million; 30–149 days past due included $13 million and $20 million; and 150 or more days past due included $25 million and $26 million at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.
(b)At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $38 million and $46 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.Approximately 33% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2020, approximately 8% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due, respectively.(b)At March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $970 million of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.(c)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged off to the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.(d)The related interest income on nonaccrual loans recorded on a cash basis was $43 million and $42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(e)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, these balances included $31 million and $34 million, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(h)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.(i)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2020.
(j)At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $53 million and $63 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $142 million and $150 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.
Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSEs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.
The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.
(b)Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.At March 31, 2020, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were 6 years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).
Active and suspended foreclosure
At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were not material.

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The  distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.

Loan modificationsThe Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.

(a)Represents the outstanding balance prior to modification.
(b)Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 35.15% and 32.89% as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.



137



Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PDs and LGDs) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.   Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.  Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.

(a)When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(b)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.
Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, was not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information.JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses comprises:•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the balance sheet,•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the balance sheet in accounts payable and other liabilities, and •the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the balance sheet.The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.
Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are included in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the

credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first.The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.Collective and Individual AssessmentsWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, level and type of collateral, industry sector, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, tenor, and payment terms. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based componentThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default.The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter

141


forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables, including U.S. real gross domestic product (“GDP”), U.S. unemployment rates and initial jobless claims, short- and long-term interest rates, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, housing prices, and oil prices. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s overarching economic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management.In light of the rapidly evolving economic conditions and forecasts during March 2020, management updated its macroeconomic forecast near the end of its credit loss estimation process in early April. This macroeconomic forecast was used to generate an updated credit loss estimate that was the primary driver of the Firm’s provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product segment. However, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic variables to degrees not seen nor experienced in recent history, which creates additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates. Management applies significant judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with various factors not already considered in the quantitative calculation, including current economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for  loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral).The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

Allowance for credit losses and related information
The table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a)Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.(b)Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.(c)The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.(d)At March 31, 2020 and 2019, lending-related commitments excluded $8.0 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; and $681.4 billion and $626.9 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.
(e)Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $19 million and a provision for credit losses of $9 million as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
Discussion of current period changes
The increase in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in the first quarter of 2020 was primarilydriven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result
of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued pressure on oil prices. In light of the rapidly evolving economic conditions and forecasts during March 2020, management updated its macroeconomic forecast near the end of its credit loss estimation process in early April. This macroeconomic forecast included a decline in the U.S. real GDP of approximately 25% and an increase in the U.S. unemployment rate to above 10%, both in the second quarter, followed by a solid recovery in the second half of 2020. In addition, the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments reflect the estimated impact of the Firm’s payment relief actions as well as the federal government’s stimulus programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A  third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $19.2 billion and $19.1 billion, of which $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion was unfunded at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to Note 23 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was $8.1 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 23 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share  a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 23 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 23, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Note 15 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights

(a)Primarily relates to foreign currency adjustments.

Goodwill impairment testingEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. The adoption of the guidance requires recognition of an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. It eliminated the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test.Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.  Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.As of March 31, 2020, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost of equity, and also reviewed actual and projections of business performance for all its reporting units. The Firm has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of March 31, 2020, or December 31, 2019, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2020 or 2019.

151


Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and
2019

In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.(c)Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d)Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

•Securities with a fair value of $12.8 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity.




Note 22 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators.
The following table presents the minimum and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a)Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% and GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as calculated under Method 2.  (b)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.  (c)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.
(e)Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively.
Current Expected Credit Losses
As disclosed in the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period.

159


The interim final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss model during the first two years of the transition period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition  provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2020, the capital measures of the Firm exclude $4.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $6.8 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions on Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure have also been incorporated into the Firm’s capital measures. Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.
The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of March 31, 2020, the capital measures are presented applying the CECL capital transition provisions. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

Note 23 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies.To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, including the impact of the Firm’s adoption of the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020.  The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

161


In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs  Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs. The carrying value of the valuation allowance was $74 million and $11 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

163


Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information.The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 162. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.Guarantees of subsidiariesThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary.

Note 25 – Litigation
Contingencies
As of March 31, 2020, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at March 31, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:•the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, •the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, •the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and •the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and no trial date has been set.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in

165


November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions also remain pending in the District Court. In January 2020, the Firm and 11 other defendants agreed in principle to settle the class action filed by purported indirect purchasers for a total of $10 million. That settlement remains subject to negotiation of final documentation and court approval. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants filed notices of appeal of the District Court’s approval order. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately.In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which  the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These actions are in various stages of litigation.In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other plaintiffs. In the consolidated putative class action related to the time period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SIBOR”), the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and certain of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class actions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the metals markets and related conduct. The Firm also is responding to related requests concerning similar trading-practices issues in markets for other financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasuries. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations and is currently engaged in discussions with various regulators about resolving their respective investigations. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in settlements. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019. The Firm is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver futures in violation of the Sherman Act.  Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.*     *     *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense/(benefit) was $197 million and $(81) million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 26 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.Segment resultsThe following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed basis.

Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on business segment capital allocation.
Business segment changes
In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises:•Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB•Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB.In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:Results of Review of Interim Financial StatementsWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 25, 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2019, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap. ERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974EPS: Earnings per shareExchange-traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.
Expense categories:
•Volume- and revenue-related expenses generally correlate with changes in the related business/transaction volume or revenue. Examples of volume- and revenue-related expenses include commissions and incentive compensation, depreciation expense related to operating lease assets, and brokerage expense related to equities trading transaction volume.•Investments include expenses associated with supporting medium- to longer-term strategic plans of the Firm. Examples of investments include initiatives in technology (including related compensation), marketing, and compensation for new bankers and client advisors.•Structural expenses are those associated with the day-to-day cost of running the bank and are expenses not covered by the above two categories. Examples of structural expenses include employee salaries and benefits, as well as noncompensation costs such as real estate and all other expenses.EU: European UnionFannie Mae: Federal National Mortgage AssociationFASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board FCA: Financial Conduct AuthorityFDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationFederal Reserve: The Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemFFIEC: Federal Financial Institutions Examination CouncilFHA: Federal Housing AdministrationFHLB: Federal Home Loan BankFICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk based on information in consumer credit reports produced by Fair Isaac Corporation.

principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Origination date LTV ratioThe LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Merchant Services: offers merchants payment processing capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and other payments services.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.MSA: Metropolitan statistical areasMSR: Mortgage servicing rightsNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.NAV: Net Asset ValueNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net interchange income includes the following components:

•Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions. •Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally tied to sales transactions. •Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningfulNonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss)OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefitOTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairmentOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating

securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represented certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date. The superseded FASB guidance allowed purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans had common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool was then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.PD: Probability of defaultPDCF: Primary Dealer Credit FacilityPhishing: a type of social engineering cyberattack received through email or online messages.PPP: Paycheck Protection ProgramPRA: Prudential Regulation AuthorityPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.Scored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans to individuals and certain small business loans.S&P: Standard and PoorsSAR(s): Stock appreciation rightsSEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.Shelf Deals: Shelf offerings are SEC provisions that allow issuers to register for new securities without selling the entire issuance at once. Since these issuances are filed with the SEC but are not yet priced in the market, they are not included in the league tables until the actual securities are issued.Single-name: Single reference-entitiesSLR: Supplementary leverage ratioSMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securities  SMCCF: Secondary Market Corporate Credit FacilitySOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate SPEs: Special purpose entities SPV: Special purpose vehicleStructural interest rate risk: represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm.Structured notes: Structured notes are financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates or indexes.  Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.TBVPS: Tangible book value per shareTCE: Tangible common equityTDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.TLAC: Total Loss Absorbing CapacityU.K.: United KingdomUnaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.U.S.: United States of AmericaU.S. government agencies: U.S. government agencies include, but are not limited to, agencies such as Ginnie Mae and FHA, and do not include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”).

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 119–126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.




Part II – Other Information

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal proceedings in Note 25 of this Form 10-Q for information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following discussion supplements the discussion of riskfactors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:Risk Factors on pages 6–28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and our businesses.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have had, and continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions, including:•significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets•disruption of global supply chains•closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment, and•the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in the U.S. and other countries.If the pandemic is prolonged, or other diseases emerge that give rise to similar effects, the adverse impact on the global economy could deepen.  The continuation of the adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic can be expected to have a significant adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations, including:•significantly reduced demand for products and services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers •possible recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially if businesses remain closed, unemployment continues to rise and clients and customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses•possible material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets due to market fluctuations•possible downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings

180


•possible constraints on liquidity and capital, whether due to increases in risk-weighted assets related to supporting client activities or to regulatory actions, and•the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, sheltering-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or on behalf of customers and clients in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny, negative publicity or increased exposure to litigation, which could increase its operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Risk Factors in the 2019 Form 10-K.
Supervision and regulation

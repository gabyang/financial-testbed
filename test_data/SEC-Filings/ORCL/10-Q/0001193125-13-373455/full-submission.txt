Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements
For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms Oracle, we, us and our refer to Oracle Corporation and
its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:


 
 our expectation to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies;


 
 our expectation that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase;


 
 our belief that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow;


 
 our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business;


 
 our international operations providing a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses;


 
 our expectation to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities, including those related to
hardware products and services;


 
 the sufficiency of our sources of funding for acquisitions or other matters;


 
 our belief that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax liabilities and that any tax settlement will not
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations;


 
 our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any;


 
 our expectation to incur the majority of the remaining expenses pursuant to the Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan through the remainder of fiscal
2014 and our expectation to improve efficiencies in our operations that will impact our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan;


 
 our expectation that to the extent customers renew support contracts or cloud software subscriptions contracts, we will recognize revenues for the full
contracts values over the respective renewal periods;


 
 our experience and ability to predict quarterly hardware systems products revenues;


 
 the timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to manufacture or deliver a few large transactions substantially affecting the amount of
hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we will report;
as well as other statements
regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates, will, is designed to and similar expressions. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to
risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our business that could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by us in our fiscal year 2014, which runs from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014.
We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except
to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New
information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date
of this Quarterly Report.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Basis of Presentation We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
However, we believe that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and
the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. We believe that all necessary
adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2014.
There have been no significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements or to our significant
accounting policies that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 that have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect our
consolidated total revenues, consolidated operating income or consolidated net income. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software
Subscriptions Revenues New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and
middleware and our applications software products. Cloud software subscriptions revenues represent fees earned from granting customers access to select Oracle software applications and software platforms on a subscription basis through a cloud-based

Sales of Financing Receivables We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these
contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of
financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, $828 million and $1.0 billion of financing receivables were sold to financial
institutions, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits:    In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11,
Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11) to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits. ASU 2013-11
requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as
follows: to the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting

does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred
tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2015 with earlier adoption permitted. ASU 2013-11 should be applied prospectively with retroactive application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our
pending adoption of ASU 2013-11 on our consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired certain companies primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not individually significant. We have included the
financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates and the results from each of these companies were not individually or collectively material to our consolidated financial
statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminary purchase price for these acquisitions was $1.4 billion, which consisted of cash consideration. We have preliminarily recorded $93 million of net tangible liabilities, related primarily to deferred
tax liabilities, $770 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $99 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated fair values, and $615 million of residual goodwill. The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for our acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal
2014 were based upon preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions for each of these acquisitions are subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the respective measurement periods (up
to one year from the respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that were not yet finalized related to certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters and
income and non-income based taxes. Fiscal 2013 Acquisitions Acquisition of Acme Packet, Inc. On March 28, 2013, we completed our
acquisition of Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet), a provider of session border control technology. We have included the financial results of Acme Packet in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total preliminary
purchase price for Acme Packet was approximately $2.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $2.1 billion in cash and $12 million for the fair value of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. We have preliminarily recorded $258
million of net tangible assets, $525 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $45 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.3 billion of residual goodwill. Acquisition of Eloqua, Inc. On
February 8, 2013, we completed our acquisition of Eloqua, Inc. (Eloqua), a provider of cloud-based marketing automation and revenue performance management software. We have included the financial results of Eloqua in our consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. The total preliminary purchase price for Eloqua was approximately $935 million, which consisted of approximately $933 million in cash and $2 million for the fair value of stock options assumed. We have
preliminarily recorded $1 million of net tangible assets and $327 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $607 million of residual goodwill.

Other Fiscal 2013 Acquisitions During fiscal 2013, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not
significant individually or in the aggregate. The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for certain
acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 were based upon preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions for each of these acquisitions are subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the
respective measurement periods (up to one year from the respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that were not yet finalized related to certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible
assets, certain legal matters and income and non-income based taxes. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, Acme Packet, Eloqua and certain
other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2013 (which were considered significant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure) as though the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal
2013. The pro forma financial information for all periods presented also included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions including our amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which were
preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2013. The pro
forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2013. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended August 31, 2013 combined the historical results of Oracle for the three
months ended August 31, 2013, the historical results of certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2014 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us, and
the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended
August 31, 2012 combined the historical results of Oracle for the three months ended August 31, 2012, the historical results of Acme Packet for the three months ended September 30, 2012 (due to differences in reporting periods), the
historical results of Eloqua for the three months ended September 30, 2012 (due to differences in reporting periods), the historical results of certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2013 based upon their
respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy
that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

 

 
 Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

 

 
 Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities; or 

 

 
 Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or
liabilities. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and 2
inputs are defined above):

Our marketable securities investments consisted of Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and
certain other securities. As of August 31, 2013 and May 31, 2013, approximately 83% and 91%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 17% and 9%, respectively, mature within one to four years. Our
valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our marketable securities that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments exist. Our valuation techniques used
to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data,
quoted market

prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including
LIBOR-based yield curves, among others. Based on the trading prices of our $24.1 billion and $18.5 billion of borrowings, which consisted of
senior notes that were outstanding as of August 31, 2013 and May 31, 2013, respectively, the estimated fair values of our borrowings using Level 2 inputs at August 31, 2013 and May 31, 2013 were $25.5 billion and $20.7 billion,
respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER BORROWINGS
Senior Notes In July
2013, we issued 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of August 31, 2013) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of 1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes,
and together with the 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. We issued the Euro Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our
common stock and future acquisitions. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap
agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion

with an annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 9 for additional information). Further, we designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international
subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. Refer to Note 9 for
additional information. In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes due January
2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes). The 2019 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus
0.58% (0.85% as of August 31, 2013) with interest payable quarterly. We issued these senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions.
The effective interest yield of the 2019 Notes was 2.44% and interest is payable semi-annually. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest
rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable (0.92% at August 31, 2013; see Note 9 for
additional information). The effective interest yield of the 2021 Notes was 2.33% (3.53% after the economic effects of the cross-currency swap agreements described above and in Note 9) and interest is payable annually. The effective interest yields
of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes at August 31, 2013 were 3.73% and 3.17%, respectively. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually whereas interest on the 2025 Notes is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of the 2019 Notes,
2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2025 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) prior to their maturity subject to the payment of an applicable make-whole premium. The 2019 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed prior to their maturity. The Senior Notes and the 2019 Floating Rate Notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program
and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for further information
on our commercial paper program and other borrowings). All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes and the 2019 Floating Rate Notes and any future issuances of
commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at August 31, 2013. There have been no other significant
changes in our notes payable or other borrowing arrangements that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Our
management subsequently amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the
2013 Restructuring Plan are $705 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $54 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2013
Restructuring Plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $326 million through the remainder of fiscal 2014. Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2013 Restructuring Plan will be
reflected in our future results of operations.

Deferred software license updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware systems support revenues represent
customer payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our
services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements,
customer specific acceptance provisions,

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)

(Unaudited)

customer payments made in advance for time-based arrangements including cloud software subscriptions offerings that are typically billed in advance and recognized over the corresponding
contractual term, and software license transactions that cannot be segmented from undelivered consulting or other services. In connection with
our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscriptions, software license updates and product support, and hardware systems support obligations assumed from our acquired companies. We have estimated the fair values of
the obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit
approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the acquired obligations. The aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the new software licenses
and cloud software subscriptions, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized
or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.

9.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value HedgesInterest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on
these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 3.75% senior notes
due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements
pertain to match, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as
qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they
protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated
statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities for the 2014 Notes, and other assets or other non-current liabilities for the 2019 Notes in our consolidated
balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current and other current
borrowings for the 2014 Notes, and notes payable and other non-current borrowings for the 2019 Notes. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense.
We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes. Cash Flow HedgesCross Currency Swap Agreements In connection with the
issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and
the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the
principal amount of the 2021 Notes at

15


Table of Contents
ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)
August 31, 2013
(Unaudited)

$1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges
pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the 2021 Notes.
We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these
cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income, net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro based 2021 Notes
is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately to non-operating income, net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the three months ended August 31, 2013. We
do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes. Net Investment HedgeForeign Currency Borrowings
In July 2013, we designated our Euro based 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international
subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying
value of the Euro based 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any,
is recognized in non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the three months ended
August 31, 2013. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the
risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 (refer to
Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for additional information regarding these contracts). As of August 31, 2013 and May 31, 2013,
respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held
to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $768 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at August 31, 2013 and May 31,
2013. Included in our non-operating income, net were $68 million of net gains and $33 million of net losses related to these forward contracts for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Stock Repurchases Our
Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion.
Approximately $11.1 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of August 31, 2013 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 92.8 million shares for $3.0 billion during the three months ended August 31, 2013
(including 4.4 million shares for $139 million that were repurchased but not settled) and 104.2 million shares for $3.1 billion during the three months ended August 31, 2012 under the stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working
capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend

payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchase of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open
market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Dividends on Common Stock In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, our Board of Directors
declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock, which we paid during the same period. In September 2013, our
Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on October 29, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 8, 2013. Future declarations of dividends
and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Stock-Based

During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we issued 114 million stock options (including our annual grant of stock
options). These stock option-based award issuances were partially offset by forfeitures and cancellations of 7 million shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We estimate the fair values of our share-based payments using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation
models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize
as stock-based compensation expense. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates
or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business

combination. The weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of our stock options were as follows for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012:

The expected life input is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free
interest rate input is based on U.S. Treasury instruments, the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors and the volatility input is calculated based on the implied volatility of our
publicly traded options.

11.
INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate for the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a
broad range of income tax rates. Our provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes,
the U.S. research and development tax credit, acquisition related settlements with tax authorities and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Our effective tax rate was 17.7% and 24.7% for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and
2012, respectively. Our net deferred tax assets were $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of August 31, 2013 and May 31, 2013,
respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years
in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in
future periods if estimates of future taxable income change. Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining
income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2012. Our U.S. federal and, with some exceptions, our state income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2000 and we are no longer subject to
audit for those periods. Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our
unrecognized tax benefits. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1998. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes.

12.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding

19


Table of Contents
ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)
August 31, 2013
(Unaudited)

how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We are organized geographically and by line of business. While our Chief
Executive Officer evaluates results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. We have three businessessoftware,
hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions and (2) software license
updates and product support. Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. All other operating segments are combined under our services business.
The new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions line of business is engaged in licensing our database and middleware software and
our applications software, and providing access to a broad range of our software offerings on a subscription basis through a cloud-based computing environment. Database and middleware software generally include database and database management
software; application server and cloud application software; Service-Oriented Architecture and business process management software; business intelligence software; identity and access management software; data integration software; web experience
management, portals, content management and social network software; and development tools. Our database and middleware software product offerings also include Java, which is a global software development platform used in a wide range of computers,
networks and devices. Applications software provides enterprise information that enables companies to manage and automate core business functions. Oracle Applications address specific business and industry requirements including human capital and
talent management; customer experience and customer relationship management; financial management and governance, risk and compliance; procurement; project portfolio management; supply chain management; business analytics and enterprise performance

increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our software and hardware
products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. We do not track our assets by operating segments. Consequently, it is not
practical to show assets by operating segment. Certain costs have been reclassified in the presentation of our segment reporting for the first
quarter of fiscal 2013 to align with our current line of business management structure.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
SAP Intellectual Property Litigation On March 22, 2007, Oracle Corporation, Oracle USA, Inc. and Oracle International Corporation (collectively, Oracle) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against SAP AG, its wholly-owned subsidiary, SAP America, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TomorrowNow, Inc., (the SAP Subsidiary, and collectively, the SAP Defendants) alleging that SAP unlawfully accessed Oracles Customer
Connection support website and improperly took and used Oracles intellectual property. Trial commenced on November 1, 2010 on the
issue of damages, as SAP had stipulated to liability. The jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion. On September 1, 2011, the court granted the SAP Defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. The court vacated the $1.3
billion award and held that Oracle could either accept a reduced amount or remittitur of $272 million or proceed to a new trial. On February 6, 2012, Oracle rejected the remittitur and requested a new trial. On August 2, 2012, Oracle and the SAP Defendants stipulated to a judgment of $306 million against the SAP Defendants, in lieu of having a second jury
trial, while preserving both parties rights to appeal prior court orders. We recorded a $306 million non-current receivable, included in other assets, in our consolidated balance sheet and we recognized a corresponding benefit to our results
of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Previously during trial we received payment of $120 million in attorneys fees from SAP under a stipulation, and we recorded this payment upon receipt as a benefit to our results of operations
during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. On August 3, 2012, the court entered the judgment and vacated the date set for the new trial. Oracle filed a Notice of Appeal on August 31, 2012, and the SAP Defendants filed a notice of appeal on
September 14, 2012. The SAP Defendants subsequently dismissed their appeal. Oracles appeal has been fully briefed. The appellate court has not yet scheduled a date for oral argument.

Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action
including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged that
when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark
Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd
Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on
December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had
misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court
issued a final statement of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itanium-based servers and to port such products at
no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision. The issues of breach, HPs performance, causation and damages, HPs tort claims, and Oracles cross-claims will all be tried
before a jury. As of April 8, 2013, the trial is stayed pending Oracles appeal of the courts denial of its anti-SLAPP motion. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have
meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it. Derivative Litigations and Related Action
Various stockholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against Oracle and certain former and current directors in connection with a qui
tam lawsuit that had been filed against Oracle in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The qui tam action alleged that Oracle made false statements to the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1997-1998 while
negotiating its GSA contract, among other claims. Oracle settled this action without admitting liability, and the case was dismissed on October 11, 2011. The following stockholder derivative actions have been filed, claiming that the named
officer and director defendants were responsible for certain alleged conduct in the qui tam action and thereby exposing Oracle to reputational damage, monetary damages and costs and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control and
unjust enrichment: on August 2, 2010, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; on August 19, 2010, a similar stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in
California Superior Court, County of San Mateo; and on September 8, 2011, another stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The first two derivative actions were
consolidated, but pursuant to a motion by Oracle, they were dismissed on November 11, 2011, with leave to plaintiffs to amend. No amended complaint has been filed. On September 12, 2011, two alleged stockholders of Oracle filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate for Inspection of Corporate Books and Records in California Superior Court, County of San
Mateo. The petition originally named as respondents Oracle and two of our officers, both of whom were subsequently dismissed. The alleged stockholders claim that they are investigating alleged corporate mismanagement relating to the claims in the
qui tam action, and asked the court to compel the inspection of certain of Oracles accounting books and

(Unaudited)

records and minutes of meetings of the stockholders, our Board of Directors and the committees of our Board of Directors, related to those allegations, plus expenses of the audit and
attorneys fees. At a hearing on November 10, 2011, the court granted the alleged stockholders request for a Writ of Mandate, which was confirmed in a judgment on December 12, 2011. Oracle filed a notice of appeal on
February 2, 2012. The parties in the derivative and Writ of Mandate actions discussed above have reached a tentative settlement of these
actions, under which Oracle will continue or implement certain corporate governance measures, which shall remain in place for three years, and Oracle will pay, or cause Oracles insurers to pay, plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs
up to $1.9 million. The court held a preliminary fairness hearing on July 11, 2013, and the court preliminarily approved the settlement at that hearing. A final fairness hearing is scheduled for September 26, 2013. On September 30, 2011, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and a second stockholder was permitted to
intervene as a plaintiff on November 15, 2011. At an August 22, 2012, hearing, the court dismissed certain claims but permitted certain claims for breach of fiduciary duty to proceed. On May 3, 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint. The derivative suit is brought by two alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracles behalf, against one former director and all but two of our current directors, including against our Chief Executive Officer as an alleged
controlling stockholder. Plaintiffs allege that Oracles directors breached their fiduciary duties in agreeing to purchase Pillar Data Systems, Inc. at an excessive price. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, rescission of the Pillar Data
transaction, damages, disgorgement of our Chief Executive Officers alleged profits, disgorgement of all compensation earned by defendants as a result of their service on Oracles Board or any committee of the Board, and an award of
attorneys fees and costs. The parties attended a mediation on September 3, 2013, and continue to discuss a possible settlement of this matter. Trial is scheduled for November 18 to 22, 2013. While the outcome of the derivative litigations and the related action noted above cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome
of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any. Other Litigation We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either
asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.

Item 2.    Managements Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and
judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the worlds largest provider of enterprise software and a
leading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware as well as web-based
applications, virtualization, clustering and large-scale systems management. We provide cloud services as well as software and hardware products to other cloud service providers, both public and private. Oracle database and middleware software,
applications software and hardware systemsincluding computer server, storage and networking productsare the building blocks of our own cloud services, our partners cloud services and our customers private cloud environments.
Our customers can subscribe to use select Oracle software and hardware products through our cloud offerings, or purchase our software and hardware products and related services to build their own cloud or on-premise information technology (IT)
environments. Our strategy is to deliver reliable and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently. We also pursue new or emerging growth opportunities in order to
maintain technology leadership. Offering customers a choice in how they use our products and serviceswhile maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and interoperabilityis important to our corporate strategy. We believe that internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our
long-term strategic plans. We continue to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability and security to our customers. For example,
Oracle Engineered Systems, which include our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SPARC SuperCluster products, among others, combine certain of our hardware and software offerings in a way that increases
computing performance relative to our competitors products, creating time savings, efficiencies and operational cost advantages for our customers. With products that are engineered to work together, our customers can reduce much of the
complexity of IT and make available resources they would otherwise spend on IT operations. In addition to our introductions of new, innovative hardware and software products, we also continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer choice through
ongoing enhancements to our existing products, including our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards applications software products. We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base,
provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add
to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. We are organized into three businessessoftware, hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique
characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Software Business Our
software business, which represented 75% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions and (2) software license updates and product
support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and subscription offerings,

our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our
acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software
Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions:    We license our database and middleware, as well as our applications software, and provide access to a broad range of our software offerings through cloud software
subscriptions contracts. Our software solutions are substantially built on a standards-based, integrated architecture that is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our software products are
substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third
party UNIX products, among others. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to
offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. The growth in new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints,
the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software licenses transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software
license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues. Since our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to
predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period provides additional visibility into the
underlying performance of this business segment. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 28% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts are generally one to
three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segments margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters
within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new
software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segments margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscriptions obligations that we assumed in our business combinations
(described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. For
certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce cloud software subscriptions obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not
recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to cloud software subscriptions contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $3 million and $19 million for the three
months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud software subscriptions contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud software
subscriptions contracts over their respective contractual periods. Software License Updates and Product
Support:    Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as
well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.
The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of
new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 47% of our total revenues on a
trailing 4-quarter basis, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins over the trailing 4-quarters were 88% and accounted for 75% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support
margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that
software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: 

 

 
 substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal;


 

 
 substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a
further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods
assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which
add to our software support contract base; and 

 

 
 our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.
We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair
values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise
recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $1 million and $5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us
following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business is comprised of two
operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 14% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins
as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in
research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware
Systems Products:    We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT
environments, including public and private cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT
infrastructures. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers
when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems. Oracle Engineered Systems are core building blocks for Oracles data center and cloud computing products and services. Oracle Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
an on-premise cloud offering for deploying Oracles Engineered Systems to customers on a subscription basis, provides our customers with flexibility in deployment models and allows our customers to cost effectively handle peak computing
workloads with capacity on demand. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle
Solaris operating system and are differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems

for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core
component of the Oracle SPARC SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are
based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are also compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 systems are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems
including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk,
flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into
our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We also offer products and services for communications networks including network
signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, amongst others. The majority of our
hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. To produce our
hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our
Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware
products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner
facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a build-to-order manufacturing process in which products generally are built only
after customers have placed firm orders. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts
sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products
and hardware systems operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints,
certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to
timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support:    Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the
functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract
arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware
products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware systems support contract

customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade
their existing hardware systems infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins
have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business
combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support
revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $5 million and $4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed
with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods. Services Business Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our
operating segments and offers consulting services, managed cloud services and education services. Our services business, which represented 11% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, has lower margins than our software and hardware
businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending
and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our consulting line of business is designed to help our customers more
successfully architect and deploy our products. Our consulting services include business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and
upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products to which
they relate and are performed after the customers purchase of the products. Our services revenues as they relate to consulting services are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of our product revenues, in particular the new
software licenses sales of our application products. Oracle managed cloud services provide comprehensive software and hardware management and
maintenance servicesincluding deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade servicesfor customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer
facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. We believe that our managed cloud services offerings provide
our customers with greater value and choice through increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and
services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and
use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. Acquisitions
An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions
of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Tekelec Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013,
amongst others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our
revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return
on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in
the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as
set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that
these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant
estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: 

 

 
 Revenue Recognition 

 

 
 Business Combinations 

 

 
 Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments 

 

 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 

 

 
 Legal and Other Contingencies 

 

 
 Stock-Based Compensation 

 

 
 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which
managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 provides a more complete discussion
of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in the first
quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we quantify
the contributions of our acquired products (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues, hardware systems products revenues and hardware systems support
revenues. The incremental contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating
segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as the quantified amounts
themselves, may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: 

 

 
 the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration
efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and 

 

 
 although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support
contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscriptions contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions deferred
revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue
improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Seasonality
Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force
incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. Our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses
are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term.
Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by
changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the
results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are
converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2013, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an
entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on August 31, 2013 and 2012, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.33 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 (using 1.33 as the
month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.25 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (using 1.25 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the results for the first
quarter of fiscal 2014 and 2013 using the May 31, 2013 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in
reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses

 Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa 

(2) 
 Asia Pacific includes Japan Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, our total revenues increased by 4% in the first quarter of
fiscal 2014 due to an increase in our software business revenues, which was attributable to growth in our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions, and due to
growth in our software license updates and product support revenues. On a constant currency basis, the contribution of our software business revenues to our total revenues growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was partially offset by decreases
in revenues from our hardware systems and services businesses. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 75% and Asia Pacific contributed 25% to the increase in total revenues. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total operating expenses increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due primarily to a $306 million benefit
that we recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 related to certain litigation that decreased our expenses in that period (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for
additional information) and an increase in our sales and marketing and research and development expenses, which resulted primarily from higher employee related expenses due to increased headcount. These increases in our total expenses were partially
offset by expense decreases in our services business due primarily to lower employee related and external contractor expenses, expense decreases in our hardware systems business due primarily to a reduction in hardware systems products costs
associated with lower revenues, a decrease in our restructuring expenses, and a decrease in intangible assets amortization. Excluding the
effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our operating margin increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due to the increase in our total revenues. Our operating margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased during the first quarter
of fiscal 2014 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues primarily due to the $306 million benefit recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial
performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other
significant expense and income items:

 In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscriptions, software support and hardware systems
support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as
independent entities in the amounts of $3 million and $19 million for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support
contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $1 million and $5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we did not
recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $5 million and $4 million for the three months
ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 

    
Approximately $3 million of estimated cloud software subscriptions revenues related to contracts assumed will not be recognized during the remainder of fiscal 2014 that
would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. In addition, approximately $7 million of estimated hardware
systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during the remainder of fiscal 2014 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the
application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods.

 Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based
compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. In the first quarter of fiscal
2013, acquisition related and other expenses included a benefit of $306 million related to certain litigation (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional
information). 

(4) 
 The significant majority of restructuring expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and 2013 related to employee severance and facility exit
costs in connection with our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from
acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

 The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the
respective periods presented. Income tax effects were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 instead
of 17.7%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our condensed consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effect of amortization of intangible assets.
Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 instead of 24.7%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our condensed consolidated statement of operations, due to
the disproportionate tax rate impact of discrete items for the quarter, the tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, and differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses.
Software Business Our software business consists of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment and software license updates and product support segment. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions:    New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from
granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our applications software products. Cloud software subscriptions revenues represent fees earned from granting customers access to a broad range of our software offerings on a
subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment that includes access, hosting, infrastructure management, the use of software updates, and support. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and
internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Expenses associated with our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues are included in sales and
marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the cost of providing cloud software subscriptions services and amortization
of intangible assets.

Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total new software licenses and cloud
software subscriptions revenues increased by 7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, growth in revenues from the Americas and Asia
Pacific regions was partially offset by a decline in revenues from the EMEA region. In reported currency, our new software licenses revenues
were $1.4 billion in each of the first quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. In reported currency, our cloud software subscriptions revenues were $254 million and $203 million in the first quarters fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. In
constant currency, our new software licenses revenues and our cloud software subscriptions revenues increased by 5% and 26%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $81 million of growth to our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions
revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In constant currency, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased over the trailing 4-quarters by 5% primarily due to our acquisitions. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud software subscriptions obligations to their estimated fair values at the
acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud software subscriptions revenues in the amounts of $3 million and $19 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent
entities were not recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud software subscriptions contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full
values of the cloud software subscriptions contracts over the respective contractual periods. In reported currency, new software licenses
revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 10% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and represented 23% of our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 in
comparison to 22% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total new software
licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher employee related expenses including higher salaries and variable compensation expenses. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of
revenues decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as our total expenses associated with this segment increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. Software License Updates and Product Support:    Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and
patches released during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software
license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer
relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, software license updates and product
support revenues increased by 8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as a result of new software licenses sold (with substantially all customers electing to purchase software support contracts) during the trailing
4-quarter period, the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period and incremental revenues from recent acquisitions. Excluding
the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56%, EMEA contributed 28% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the
acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts in the amounts of $1 million and $5 million that would have been
otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in the first quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies,
renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the support periods, the
substantial majority of which are one year in duration. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total software
license updates and product support expenses were flat. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and
product support margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased due to our increase in total revenues associated with this segment. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware
systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. Hardware Systems
Products:    Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server, storage and networking products, including sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We market and sell our
hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems
products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation,
including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation
earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems products revenues decreased in the first
quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy product lines, including lower margin products. These revenue decreases were partially offset by increases in hardware revenues attributable to certain
of our Oracle Engineered Systems and $47 million of incremental revenues from our acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products operating expenses declined primarily due to a reduction in hardware
systems products costs associated with lower hardware revenues, partially offset by an increase in employee related expenses due to an increase in hardware systems headcount. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and margin as a
percentage of revenues decreased as our total revenues for this segment decreased at a faster rate than our total expenses. Hardware
Systems Support:    Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris
and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer
products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

Excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, hardware systems support revenues
increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions, partially offset by reductions in sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware systems product lines for which we offer hardware systems
support. In reported currency, hardware systems support revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 included incremental revenues of $33
million from our recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business
combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $5 million and $4 million that would have been otherwise reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were
not recognized in the first quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent these underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support
periods. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in the first quarter
of fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount, reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives and lower amortization of intangible assets. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a

Business Our services business consists of consulting, managed cloud services and education services. Consulting revenues are earned by
providing services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Managed cloud services revenues are
earned by providing comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance servicesincluding deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade servicesfor customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities,
select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and
services. Education revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, media-based, internet-based and custom training in the use of our software and hardware products. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related
expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased during the first quarter of fiscal
2014 due to revenue decreases in each of our services segments. The largest services revenues decrease in our first quarter of fiscal 2014 was to our consulting segments revenues. On a constant currency basis, the decline in our total services
revenues in the Americas and EMEA regions was partially offset by an increase in revenues in the Asia Pacific region. Excluding the effect of
currency rate fluctuations, our total services expenses decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due to expense decreases across all of our services segments, which consisted primarily of decreases in employee related expenses attributable
to decreased headcount, lower external contractor costs, and lower intangible asset amortization. Excluding the effect of currency rate
fluctuations, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased slightly during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as our total services revenues decreased at a faster rate than our total services expenses.
Research and Development Expenses:    Research and development expenses
consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as certain of our intangible assets
pertaining to our acquisitions of Sun Microsystems, Inc. and certain other companies became fully amortized. These decreases were partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent
acquisitions. Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses:    Acquisition related and other
expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the
measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from
acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

On a constant currency basis, the increase in our acquisition related and other expenses in the first quarter of fiscal
2014 was primarily due to a $306 million benefit that we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to professional fees and other, net related to certain litigation (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information).
Restructuring expenses:    Restructuring
expenses result from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses
consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 7 of
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Restructuring expenses in the first quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily related to our 2013 Restructuring Plan,
which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014
to reflect additional actions that we expect to take to improve efficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan are $705 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense
line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan were approximately $326 million as of August 31, 2013. The majority
of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the remainder of fiscal 2014. Our estimated costs may be subject to change in future periods. Interest Expense:

Interest expense increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due to higher average borrowings resulting from our
issuance of $3.0 billion and 2.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013 and our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, partially offset by the maturity and repayment of $1.25 billion of senior notes in April 2013 (see Recent
Financing Activities below and Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our fiscal 2014 borrowings). Non-Operating Income, net:    Non-operating income, net consists primarily
of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses)
including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased primarily due to an increase in foreign currency
transaction losses and a net decrease in other income, net that was primarily attributable to a reduction in unrealized gains from marketable securities that we designated as trading to support our deferred compensation plan obligations, partially
offset by a decrease in noncontrolling interests in income of our majority owned subsidiaries, in each case during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Provision for Income Taxes:    Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in
various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in
foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we
have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Working capital:    The increase in working capital as of August 31, 2013 in
comparison to May 31, 2013 was primarily due to our issuance of 2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2013, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during the first quarter of
fiscal 2014, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by the reclassification of $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from long-term to current, cash used for repurchases of our
common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions, all of which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods,
the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:     Cash and cash
equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial
paper, corporate notes, and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at August 31, 2013 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities,
our issuance of 2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by $3.0 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $1.3 billion
of net cash paid for acquisitions and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $29.9 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2013, a significant portion of
which was generated from the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries that we consider as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings that are considered as indefinitely reinvested overseas
would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject
to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in our consolidated balance sheets
and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during
the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased as of August 31, 2013 relative to what we would have reported using constant
currency rates from our May 31, 2013 balance sheet date. Days sales outstanding, which was calculated by dividing period end accounts
receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 37 days at August 31, 2013 compared with 50 days at May 31, 2013. The days sales outstanding calculation excluded the impact of revenue adjustments that reduced our acquired cloud
software subscriptions obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. Our decline in days sales outstanding was primarily due to the collection, in our first quarter of
fiscal 2014, of large software license and software support balances outstanding as of May 31, 2013.

Cash flows from operating activities:    Our largest source of operating cash flows is
cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the
contracts terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software licenses sales and sales of hardware systems support arrangements, and to a lesser extent, sales of services, hardware systems
products, and cloud software subscriptions. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased
facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the following, which in
each case compares the favorable cash impacts for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2013: the cash favorable impacts of increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and
depreciation; improved collections of customer receivables; additional cash inflows associated with arrangements for which revenues were initially deferred at the outset of the arrangements, primarily software support arrangements; and the impact of
a $306 million non-cash benefit that we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Cash flows from investing activities:    The changes in cash flows from
investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to
support our growth. Net cash used for investing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due to an increase in cash used for
acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities), in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Cash flows from financing activities:    The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to
borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 increased in comparison to net cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 primarily due to our
issuance of 2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013 (no issuances of debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2013) and the repayment of borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (we repaid $1.7 billion of short-term
borrowings pursuant to certain expired revolving credit facilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in comparison to no repayments during the first quarter of fiscal 2014). These favorable impacts to our financing cash flows during the first
quarter of fiscal 2014 were partially offset by an increase in dividends paid and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Free cash flow:    To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze
cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as
an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows:

 Derived from capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities as per our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Long-Term Customer Financing:    We offer certain
of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse
basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered
control of these financial assets. We financed $236 million and $146 million, respectively, or approximately 14% and 9%, respectively, of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and
2013, and $34 million and $27 million, respectively, or approximately 5% and 3%, respectively, of our hardware systems products revenues in the first quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Recent Financing Activities: Senior Notes:    In July
2013, we issued 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of August 31, 2013) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of 1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes,
and together with the 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. We are accounting for the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our

investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in
foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes due January 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes),
$1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes, and together with the Floating Rate Notes and 2019 Notes, the U.S. Dollar Notes). We issued the Euro Notes and the U.S. Dollar Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on
our common stock and future acquisitions. Additional details regarding the Euro Notes, the U.S. Dollar Notes, and related hedge accounting are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Interest Rate Swap Agreements:    In July 2013, we entered into certain
interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. As of August 31,
2013, our 2019 Notes had an effective interest rate of 0.92% after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to
ASC 815. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Cross Currency Swap Agreements:    In July 2013, in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain
cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to
fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6
billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. Additional details regarding our senior
notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Common Stock Repurchases:    Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of
Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. Approximately $11.1 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of August 31, 2013 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Our stock
repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations,
our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or
discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations:    During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, there were no
significant changes to our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as presented in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 other than those items noted under Recent Financing ActivitiesSenior Notes;Interest Rate Swap Agreements; andCross Currency Swap Agreements above.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our
working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:    We do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to investors. Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of
existing stockholders. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions. We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while
providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2010 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 2.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is
calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average
outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the outstanding stock options at August 31, 2013, which
generally have a 10-year exercise period, approximately 19.8% have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based
compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At August 31, 2013,
the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher
than the current market price, was 11.8%. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Item 3.    
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Expense Risk In July 2013, we issued 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of August 31, 2013) of fixed rate senior notes and $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised
of $500 million of floating rate notes and $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the Recent Financing Activities section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) in
this Quarterly Report. Our total borrowings were $24.1 billion as of August 31, 2013, consisting of $23.6 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $500 million of floating rate borrowings. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due
January 2019 (2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed
interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements
and the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815.
Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable
interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of August 31, 2013, our 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes had effective interest rates of 1.34% and 0.92%, respectively, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements.
Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in
cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of August 31, 2013, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $35
million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings. Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Risks In July 2013, we issued 1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign exchange risk by
effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic
effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. In July 2013, we also issued 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes). We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of
our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with
respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the change in the carrying value of the Euro based 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our
consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing
the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income, net. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the three months ended August 31, 2013. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar
weakened by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of August 31, 2013, our obligation to settle the 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $100 million. There were no other significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Please refer to Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for a more complete discussion of the market risks we encounter.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:    Based on our managements evaluation (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our President
and Chief Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in
our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Chief
Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:    There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls:    Our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
The material set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. The risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are
not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future.
Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of
Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. Approximately $11.1 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of August 31, 2013 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working
capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time
through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock
repurchase program:

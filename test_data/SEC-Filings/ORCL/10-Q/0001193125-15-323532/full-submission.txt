Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements
For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms Oracle, we, us and our refer to Oracle Corporation and
its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:


 
 our expectation that we will continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies;


 
 our beliefs regarding how our acquisitions, investments and innovations will help us achieve our long-term strategic plans;


 
 continued realization of gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures;


 
 our expectation that the total revenues of our cloud and on-premise software business generally will continue to increase;


 
 our belief that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow;


 
 our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software
business;


 
 our intention that we will renew our software as a service and platform as a service contracts when they are eligible for renewal;


 
 our international operations providing a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses;


 
 our expectation that we will continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities, including those
related to hardware products and services, and our belief that research and development efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position;


 
 the sufficiency of our sources of funding for acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases and other matters;


 
 our expectation that we will continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis and in amounts comparable to prior periods;


 
 our belief that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and our belief that our net deferred tax
assets will be realized in the foreseeable future;


 
 our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any;


 
 our expectations regarding the timing and amount of expenses relating to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan and the improved efficiencies in our
operations that such plan will have;


 
 the timing and amount of our stock repurchases;


 
 our expectation that we will continue to depend on third party manufacturers to build certain hardware products and third party logistics providers to
deliver our products;


 
 our expectation that to the extent customers renew support contracts or cloud software as a service and platform as a service contracts, we will
recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective renewal periods;


 
 our ability to predict quarterly hardware revenues;


 
 our expectations that our revenues will continue to follow a seasonal trend;
as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may
be preceded by, followed by or include the words expects,

Table of Contents
anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, strives, estimates, will, should,
is designed to and similar expressions. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements. We have based these
forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our business that could affect our future results and could cause
those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk
Factors included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q to be filed by us in our fiscal year 2016, which runs from June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016.
We have no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should
be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur. You should not
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.

regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. We believe that all
necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are
not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2016. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-15, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit ArrangementsAmendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, and ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, neither of which had an impact on our reported financial position or results
of operations and cash flows. There have been no other significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements or to our significant accounting
policies that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 that have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses,
integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in
acquisition related and other expenses result from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock
options and restricted stock-based awards.

Sales of Financing Receivables We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that
we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing
receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During the three months ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, $972 million and $724 million of financing receivables were sold to financial
institutions, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Cloud Computing Arrangements that Include a Software Element:    In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU
2015-05, IntangiblesGoodwill and OtherInternal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (ASU 2015-05). ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers
about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other
software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new guidance does not change the accounting for a customers accounting for
service contracts. ASU 2015-05 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted using either of two methods: (i) prospective to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date
and represents a change in accounting principle; or (ii) retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2015-05 on our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition:    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic
606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue
recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price
to each separate performance obligation, among others. The original effective date of ASU 2014-09 would have required us to adopt the

8

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)
August 31, 2015
(Unaudited)

standard in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (ASU 2015-14),
which defers the effective date by one year while providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date. Accordingly, we may adopt the standard either in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarter of fiscal 2019
using either of two methods: (i) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective application of
ASU 2014-09 with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the timing and the impact of
our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions Acquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc. On June 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. On July 3, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we
commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MICROS at a purchase price of $68.00 per share, net to the holder in cash, without interest thereon, based upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement. Between September 3, 2014 and September 8, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, we accepted and paid for the substantial majority of outstanding shares of MICROS common stock. On
September 8, 2014, we effectuated the merger of MICROS with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable Maryland law, and MICROS became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Oracle. Pursuant to the merger, shares of MICROS common stock that remained outstanding and were not acquired by us were converted into, and cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive $68.00 per share in cash. The unvested equity awards to
acquire MICROS common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We acquired
MICROS to, among other things, expand our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and related services offerings for hotels, food and beverage industries, facilities, and retailers. We have included the financial results of MICROS in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we estimated the preliminary fair values of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such fair values was recorded as goodwill. The preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based
upon preliminary valuations and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets
acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist us in determining the fair values of the net assets
acquired during the measurement period. The following table summarizes the estimated preliminary fair values of net assets acquired from MICROS:

We do not expect the goodwill recognized as a part of the MICROS acquisition to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Other Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions During fiscal 2015, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not
individually significant. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates and the results from each of these companies were not individually material
to our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminary purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $1.7 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.7 billion in cash and $7 million for the fair values of stock
options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. We have preliminarily recorded $14 million of net tangible assets and $388 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.3 billion of residual goodwill.
The initial purchase price calculation and related accounting for certain of our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 is preliminary. The
preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for certain of our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 were based upon preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions for certain of
these acquisitions are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that are not yet
finalized relate to certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters and income and non-income based taxes.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, MICROS, and certain other
companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2015 that were considered relevant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2015. The unaudited
pro forma financial information for all periods presented also included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including our amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which are
preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2015. The
unaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of
fiscal 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended August 31, 2015 includes only the historical
results of Oracle for the three months ended August 31, 2015 and is included below for comparative purposes only. The unaudited pro forma
financial information for the three months ended August 31, 2014 combined the historical results of Oracle for the three months ended August 31, 2014, the historical results of MICROS for the three months ended June 30, 2014 (due to
differences in reporting periods), and the historical results of certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2015 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us,
and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above. The unaudited pro forma financial information was as follows:

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value
Measurement. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy
that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

 

 
 Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

 

 
 Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities; or


 
 Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or
liabilities. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and 2

Our marketable securities investments consist of Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and
certain other securities. As of August 31, 2015 and May 31, 2015, approximately 35% and 28%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 65% and 72%, respectively, mature within one to six years. Our
valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our marketable securities that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments exist. Our valuation techniques used
to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data,
quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including LIBOR-based yield curves, among others.
Based on the trading prices of our $42.0 billion of senior notes that were outstanding as of August 31, 2015 and May 31, 2015, the
estimated fair values of our borrowings using Level 2 inputs at August 31, 2015 and May 31, 2015 were $43.3 billion and $44.1 billion, respectively.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisition of MICROS and
certain other operational activities (2015 Restructuring Plan). The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan are up to $626 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our
consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $83 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2015 Restructuring Plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated
remaining $443 million through the end of fiscal 2016. Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2015 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations. Summary of All Plans

Deferred software license updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware support revenues represent customer
payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services
business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred cloud software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenues generally result from customer
payments made in advance for our cloud-based offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term. Deferred new software licenses revenues typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer specific
acceptance provisions, customer payments made in advance for time-based license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services. In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and
hardware support obligations, among others, assumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating
the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These
aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as
liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value HedgesInterest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due
October 2019 (2019 Notes) and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap
agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became
variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and
maturity dates.

We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments
and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in
the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with
the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated
statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest
expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities. We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading
purposes. Cash Flow HedgesCross-Currency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of our 1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes), we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign
currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic
effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of
3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January
2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes. We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or
other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets
and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income, net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro denominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The
ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately to non-operating income, net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not
record any ineffectiveness for the three months ended August 31, 2015 or 2014. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash
flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities. We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for
trading purposes. Net Investment HedgeForeign Currency Borrowings In July 2013, we designated our 750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes) as a net investment hedge of our investments in
certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S.
Dollar. We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the
change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the
ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating

income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness for
the three months ended August 31, 2015 or 2014. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the
risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 (refer to
Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 for additional information regarding these contracts). As of August 31, 2015 and May 31, 2015,
respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held
to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $956 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal as of August 31, 2015 and
May 31, 2015. Included in our non-operating income, net were $97 million and $(31) million of net gains (losses) related to these forward contracts for the three months ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash flows related
to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities. The effects of derivative and non-derivative instruments
designated as hedges on certain of our consolidated financial statements were as follows as of or for each of the respective periods presented below (amounts presented exclude any income tax effects): Fair Values of Derivative and Non-Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges in Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Common Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. Approximately $6.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of August 31, 2015, pursuant to
our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 75.7 million shares for $3.0 billion during the three months ended August 31, 2015 (including 5.0 million shares for $185 million that were repurchased but not settled) and
48.8 million shares for $2.0 billion during the three months ended August 31, 2014 under the stock repurchase program. Our stock
repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations
or repurchase of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated,
suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Dividends on Common Stock During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock, which we paid during the same period. In September 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable
on October 28, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 14, 2015. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of
Directors. Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock Awards During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we issued 24 million stock options and 28 million restricted stock-based awards (consisting of 26 million service-based restricted stock units
(RSUs) and 2 million performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs)). Substantially all of the awards were issued as a part of our annual stock-based award process and are subject to service-based vesting restrictions, with the PSUs also
having performance-based vesting restrictions, that are of a similar nature to those described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015.

7 million of the 24 million stock options granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 were to our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer and had contractual lives of
5 years in comparison to the 10 year contractual lives for the other stock options granted. Our 2016 stock-based award issuances were partially offset by forfeitures and cancellations of 4 million shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate for the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a
broad range of income tax rates. Our provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes,
the U.S. research and development tax credit, acquisition related settlements with tax authorities and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Our effective tax rate was 24.4% and 19.7% for the three months ended August 31, 2015 and
2014, respectively. Our net deferred tax assets were $1.0 billion and $993 million as of August 31, 2015 and May 31, 2015,
respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years
in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in
future periods if estimates of future taxable income change. Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining
income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2013. Our U.S. federal and, with some exceptions, our state income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2003 and we are no longer subject to
audit for those periods. Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our
unrecognized tax benefits. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997. We believe that we have adequately provided under U.S. GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement
effect thereof. On

July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
A final decision has yet to be issued by the Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations.
We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated
financial statements.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Our chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officers. We are organized geographically and by line of business. While our Chief Executive Officers evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business
management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. We have three
businessescloud and on-premise software, hardware and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments. Our cloud and on-premise software business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) cloud software and
on-premise software, which includes our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, (2) cloud infrastructure as a service and (3) software license updates and product support. Our hardware business is comprised of two operating segments:
(1) hardware products and (2) hardware support. All other operating segments are combined under our services business. Our cloud
software and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers our application and platform technologies, including our SaaS and PaaS offerings, which provide customers a choice of software applications and platforms that are
delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others. The cloud infrastructure as a service line of business provides comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT
infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities; deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT
infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; and certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems and related support offerings that are deployed in our
customers data centers for a monthly fee. The software license updates and product support line of business provides customers with
rights to software product upgrades and maintenance releases, patches released, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period. The hardware line of business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, industry specific hardware, virtualization software,
operating systems including the Oracle Solaris Operating System and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. Our hardware support line of business provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and
certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Our services business
is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting, advanced customer support services and education services. Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to

customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades.
Advanced customer support provides support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and
employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. We do not track our assets by operating segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. The following table presents summary results for each of our three businesses and for the operating segments of our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses:

 Cloud software and on-premise software revenues for management reporting
included revenues related to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations in the
amounts of $1 million and $2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Software license updates and product support revenues for management reporting included revenues related to software support contracts that
would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations in the amount of $1 million for the three months ended August 31,
2015. In addition, we did not recognize hardware support revenues related to hardware support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $1 million for each of the three
months ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 7 for an explanation of these adjustments and the table below for a reconciliation of our total operating segment revenues to our total revenues. Our new software license and
services revenues for management reporting also differ from amounts reported per our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to certain insignificant reclassifications between these lines for management reporting
purposes.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action
including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged that
when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark
Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd
Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on
December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had
misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court
issued a final statement of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itanium-based servers and to port such products at
no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision. The issues of breach, HPs performance, causation and damages, HPs tort claims, and Oracles cross-claims will all be tried
before a jury. As of April 8, 2013, the trial

was stayed pending Oracles appeal of the courts denial of its anti-SLAPP motion. On August 27, 2015, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial courts denial of Oracles
anti-SLAPP motion. The Court of Appeals decision becomes final on September 26, 2015, and absent any further appeal by Oracle, the matter will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and trial. We cannot currently estimate
a reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it. State of Oregon Litigation On August 22, 2014, the Attorney General for the State of
Oregon, the State of Oregon, and the Oregon Health Insurance Exchange Corporation, doing business as Cover Oregon (Cover Oregon) filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Marion against Oracle, our
then-President and Chief Financial Officer, three current and two former Oracle employees, and Mythics, Inc. The complaint alleges claims related to the work Oracle performed on Oregons healthcare exchange website and Oregons system for
delivering health and human services to low-income residents. Thereafter, Cover Oregon was dissolved, and the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services continued to assert Cover Oregons claims. Also, one of the former Oracle
employees was dismissed from the lawsuit. A First Amended Complaint was filed on August 10, 2015. The complaint alleges claims against
Oracle for fraud, violations of Oregons False Claims Act, breach of contract, and violations of the Oregon Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and alleges a violation of Oregons False Claims Act against each of the
individuals. The complaint seeks monetary damages, statutory penalties, attorneys fees and costs, and a permanent injunction prohibiting Oracle from marketing to or entering into a contract with any public corporation or agency of the State of
Oregon. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Oracle committed fraud by making false statements about the capabilities and functionality of its products and about the amount of time and effort it would take Oracles consulting and managed
cloud services operations to perform the requested work. It also alleges that Oracle breached the contracts by failing to provide what was required under the contracts and failing to perform the services in a professional manner consistent with
industry standards. The complaint alleges that Oracle violated Oregons False Claims Act by making false statements in order to obtain payment of invoices and by presenting invoices for payment that were false. The claims for violation of
Oregons Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act allege that Oracle violated the statute by making false statements in writing about the capabilities of Oracles products and the functionality and readiness of the
healthcare exchange website, and by using those false statements to obtain the signatures necessary to secure the contracts and enable payment. The claims against the individuals allege that one former employee violated Oregons False Claims Act by making false statements that fraudulently
induced the State of Oregon to enter into its contracts with Oracle, and that the other four employees violated the statute by making false statements in order to get invoices paid. Oracle responded to the original complaint on December 2, 2014, and filed a response to the First Amended Complaint on August 20, 2015. Oracle denied all claims and allegations and filed
counterclaims against the Department of Consumer and Business Services for breach of contract, quantum meruit (a claim requesting payment for the value of services provided), and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The
court granted the State of Oregons motion to dismiss Oracles claims for breach of contract and the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Oracle will seek leave to amend its allegations to reassert both dismissed
claims and to add a claim for promissory estoppel (a claim seeking to enforce promises that Oracle relied upon in providing services). Oracle seeks monetary damages to compensate it for the value of unpaid services and its attorneys fees and
costs. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and will continue to vigorously defend it.

On August 8, 2014, Oracle filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, District of Oregon in
Portland against Cover Oregon. The complaint alleged claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit and sought monetary damages to compensate Oracle for the value of unpaid services. On September 8, 2014, Oracle filed a First Amended
Complaint adding two State of Oregon agencies as defendants and adding causes of action for copyright infringement and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On January 27, 2015, Oracle filed a Second Amended Complaint.
Cover Oregon, now the Department of Consumer and Business Services, is a defendant as to all causes of action; the other state agencies are defendants to the cause of action for copyright infringement. In addition to monetary damages, Oracle seeks
an injunction prohibiting infringement of its copyrights. All defendants have moved for judgment in their favor, claiming that the state entities cannot be sued in federal court. Other Litigation We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either
asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.

Item 2.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview
of our businesses, key operating segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in
our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business
Overview Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT)
environmentsapplication, platform and infrastructureand are available to customers either via cloud computing or on-premise deployment models. Our offerings include database and middleware software, application software, cloud
infrastructure software, hardware (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry specific products), and related support and services. We offer to over 400,000 worldwide customers a choice of deployment models to best suit
their needs including (1) the deployment of our products via our Oracle Cloud offerings, (2) the acquisition of Oracle products and services for an on-premise IT environment or (3) a mix of these two models. For customers opting for a cloud computing model, Oracle offers a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of cloud applications and platform services in
all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Integrated Cloud offerings are designed to be: rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to
innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendability between cloud and on-premise IT environments; and cost effective by requiring lower
upfront customer investment. Our Oracle Cloud offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. We are a leader in the core technologies of
cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our
Oracle Cloud services, our partners cloud services and our customers cloud IT environments. In addition to offering a broad spectrum of cloud products and services, we have for decades developed and sold our products and services to our
customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to
continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT
environmentsapplication, platform and infrastructureinteract and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more
cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to take
advantage of our research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft
and JD Edwards application software products, among others, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. Oracle customers are
increasingly electing to run their IT environments using our Integrated Cloud offerings. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle
Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect these different deployment models to enable
flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. A selective and active acquisition program is another important
element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase
stockholder value. 
In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our
existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. We have
three businesses that deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: cloud and on-premise software, hardware, and services. These businesses can be further divided into certain operating segments (Note 11 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, provides additional information related to our operating segments). Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different
opportunities and challenges. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Cloud and On-Premise
Software Business Our cloud and on-premise software business, which represented 77% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter
basis, is comprised of three operating segments: (1) cloud software and on-premise software, (2) cloud infrastructure as a service and (3) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our
cloud and on-premise software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and cloud software subscription offerings, our software license updates and product support offerings,
including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow and continue to make investments in research and development. Cloud Software and On-Premise Software:    Our cloud software and on-premise software line of business markets, sells
and delivers our application and platform technologies, including our SaaS and PaaS offerings, which provide customers a choice of software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and
support, and the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others. Our application and platform technologies are substantially built on standards-based architectures
that are designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our commitment to industry standards results in software that works in customer environments with Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components and
that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business needs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and on-premise deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and
seamlessness. Our software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris,
Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third party UNIX products, among others. These approaches are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational
institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any
IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. Cloud software and on-premise software revenues represented 26% of our total
revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis. The growth in our SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the
strategy for and competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our SaaS and PaaS contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new
software license transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues. Our SaaS and PaaS arrangements are generally one
to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our cloud software and on-premise software segments margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a
particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, as discussed
further below under Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges, our cloud software and on-premise software segments margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS
obligations that 
we assumed in our business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service:    Our cloud infrastructure as a service offerings, which represented 2% of our total
revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner
data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities; deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing
and reliable and secure object storage; and certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems and related support offerings that are deployed in our customers data centers for a monthly fee. Software License Updates and Product Support:    Software license updates and product support revenues are generated through the sale of software support contracts
relating to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers. Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the
term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration. Substantially all of our software license customers renew their software license
updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its
software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 49% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, is our highest margin
business unit. Our software support margins over the trailing 4-quarters were 90% and accounted for 82% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments
relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations and by amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges. However, over the longer term, we
believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: 

 

 
 substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal;


 

 
 substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a
further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth were flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods
assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which
add to our software support contract base; and 

 

 
 our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.
Hardware Business Our hardware business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware products and (2) hardware support. Our hardware business represented 13% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter
basis. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support
services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware Products:    We provide a broad selection of hardware and related services, including Oracle Engineered
Systems, servers, storage, networking, workstations and related devices, industry specific hardware, 
virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with
virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the worlds largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle
Cloud. Our hardware products are designed to be easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance
relative to our competitors offerings. We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect on-premise and cloud IT environments to further enable interoperability, interchangeability and extendability and to work in customer environments
that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they deploy our hardware products, which we believe is a priority for our
customers. Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data center and cloud computing
offerings including the Oracle Cloud. These pre-integrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency relative to our
competitors products; to be upgraded effectively and efficiently; and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching. Oracle Engineered Systems are tested before they are shipped to customers and delivered
ready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten deployment time to production. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC
microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total
cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the
Oracle SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on
microprocessors from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata
Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products
are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage
management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. Our networking and data center fabric products, including
Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and
complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We offer hardware products and services designed for specific industries. Our
point-of-sale hardware offerings include point-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and retail industries, among others. Our hardware products and services for
communications networks include network signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, among others. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials
procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing

partners to produce our hardware-related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for
these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across
product types and a build-to-order manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Our hardware products revenues, cost of hardware products and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products, the strength
of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware products segment have been and will be affected
by the amortization of intangible assets. Our quarterly hardware products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and
delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, among other factors, could substantially affect the amount of hardware products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Support:    Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that
are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware support contract
arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees, are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. We continue to evolve hardware support processes that are intended to
proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware products. Our hardware support revenues that we report are influenced by a
number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the
percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing
hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware support margins have been and will be affected by
certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating to hardware support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under Supplemental
Disclosure Related to Certain Charges. Services Business Our services business, which represented 10% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our
cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints,
personnel reductions in our customers IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware products revenues. Our services business offerings include: 

 

 
 consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our offerings,
including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial software implementation and integration, and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our
customers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; 

 

 
 advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability
of their Oracle products and services; and 

 

 
 education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and
employees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. Acquisitions A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies,
products, services and technologies including MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS) in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can
offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in
furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from
operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before
deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial
Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within
the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and
assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: 

 

 
 Revenue Recognition 

 

 
 Business Combinations 

 

 
 Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments 

 

 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 

 

 
 Legal and Other Contingencies 

 

 
 Stock-Based Compensation In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in
its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related
disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, there were no significant
changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended
May 31, 2015 provides a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Results of Operations
Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisition of MICROS in the
second quarter of fiscal 2015. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to
the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our operating segments revenues where
such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and
services. The contributions of our acquisitions to certain of our operating segments revenues, margins and expenses for each of the respective period comparisons generally are not provided in our discussions, as they either were not separately
identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre-and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general
trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: 

 

 
 any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business
strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and


 

 
 although substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and
product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, software license updates and
product support deferred revenues, and hardware support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to
the extent customers do not renew. Seasonality Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology
industry. Our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as
our revenues (in particular, our cloud software and on-premise software segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are
expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to
provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant
currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on
May 31, 2015, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold
on August 31, 2015 and 2014, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.12 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.32 million in the first quarter
of fiscal 2015 (using 1.32 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 using the May 31, 2015 exchange rate and
indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses

 Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa 

(2) 
 Asia Pacific includes Japan Our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in
international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 9 percentage points, total operating expenses by 6 percentage points and total operating margin by 12 percentage points. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations of 9 percentage points, our total revenues increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to
revenue increases across all of our businesses. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software revenues was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, growth in our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS
revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The constant currency growth in our hardware business was attributable to growth in our hardware products and hardware support revenues, which were primarily attributable to revenue
contributions from our recent acquisitions. The constant currency growth in our services business was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 52%, EMEA
contributed 36% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the growth in our total revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the
effects of favorable currency variations of 6 percentage points, our total operating expenses increased by 9 percentage points during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to expense increases across substantially all of our lines of business, the
largest of which were due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, and increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses
to support the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues. Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 12 percentage points, our
operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased as our total revenues increased at a slower rate than our total operating expenses. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated
financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions (above)
for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following
business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense and income items:

 In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS subscriptions, software support and hardware support
obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts as presented in the above table
that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers that purchased these contractual obligations renew these contracts with us, we expect to
recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods.

 The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the
respective periods presented. Income tax effects for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 25.0%
and 21.5%, respectively, instead of 24.4% and 19.7%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our condensed consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items,
including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. Cloud and On-Premise Software Business Our cloud and on-premise software business consists of our cloud software and on-premise software segment, our cloud infrastructure as a service segment and our software license updates and product
support segment. Cloud Software and On-Premise Software:    Our cloud software and on-premise software
segment engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our cloud software offerings, including our SaaS and PaaS, and the licensing of our software for on-premise IT environments. Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings grant customers access to a broad
range of our application and platform software technologies on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based, cloud computing environment that includes access, hosting, infrastructure management, the use of software updates, and support. New
software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our application software products within on-premise IT environments. We continue to place significant emphasis, both
domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud software and on-premise software segment are included in sales and
marketing expenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses and amortization of intangible assets. These costs are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the
cost of providing our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings and amortization of intangible assets.

 Included as a component of Amortization of Intangible Assets in our condensed consolidated statements of operations
Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 7 percentage points, total revenues from
our cloud software and on-premise software segment increased by 1 percentage point in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and contributions from our recent acquisitions. This increase was partially
offset by constant currency decreases in our new software licenses revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to the strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud software offerings. In constant currency,
revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions was offset by revenue declines in the Americas region. In reported currency, new software
licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 27% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and represented 20% of our new software licenses revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 in comparison to 23% in the first
quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 7 percentage points, total cloud software and
on-premise software expenses increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase.
Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our cloud software and on-premise software segments total margin and
margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the growth in our total expenses for this operating segment. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service:    Our cloud infrastructure as a service segment provides comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for
customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities; virtual machine instance services that are subscription-based in
which we deploy, secure, provision, manage and maintain certain of our hardware products for our customers to provide them with a set of cloud-based core infrastructure capabilities like elastic compute and storage services to run workloads in the
cloud; and hardware and related support offerings for certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems that are deployed in our customers data centers for a monthly fee. Cloud IaaS expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures,
technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs. For all periods presented, our cloud IaaS segments revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and
hosting services.

Not meaningful On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS revenues increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016
primarily due to growth in our comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and hosting services and due to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas
contributed 66%, EMEA contributed 24%, and Asia Pacific contributed 10% of our IaaS revenues growth. On a constant currency basis, total cloud
IaaS expenses increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with increased headcount. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency exchange variances, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as total revenues increased at a
faster rate than our total expenses for this operating segment. Software License Updates and Product
Support:    Software license updates and product support revenues are generated through the sale of software support contracts relating to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers. Our software license
updates and product support offerings include software license updates, which grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the support period, and product support including
internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost
of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations of 9 percentage points, software license updates and product
support revenues increased by 8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all of these customers electing to purchase software support contracts during the trailing 4-quarter period, the
renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas
contributed 56%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total software
license updates and product support expenses decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. This expense decrease during the first
quarter of fiscal 2016 was partially offset by higher constant currency employee related expenses associated with increased headcount, primarily due to our recent acquisitions, and a benefit related to statutory obligations in certain jurisdictions
that we recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 that reduced our expenses in that period. Excluding the effects of unfavorable
currency rate fluctuations of 9 percentage points, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the growth in total revenues for this segment and the decrease of
amortization of intangible assets. Hardware Business Our hardware business consists of our hardware products segment and hardware support segment. Hardware Products:    Hardware products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered
Systems, computer server, storage, networking, workstations and related devices and industry specific hardware products. We market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors
and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or
by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products also include
sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 10 percentage points, total hardware
products revenues increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to incremental revenues from our recently acquired companies, primarily MICROS, offset by reductions in sales volumes of certain of our other hardware product offerings. On a
constant currency basis, revenue increases in the Americas region and EMEA region were partially offset by declines in the Asia Pacific region. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 10 percentage points, total hardware products expenses increased in the first quarter of
fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in hardware products costs associated with increased hardware products revenues and an increase in employee related expenses due to increased headcount from our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a

Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues and expenses increased during
the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to revenues and expenses growth in our consulting, managed cloud services and education segments, of which the majority of the growth was attributable to recently acquired companies. In constant currency, total margin increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our increase in revenues, while our total margin as a percentage
of total revenues decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this business. Research and Development Expenses:    Research and development expenses
consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

Excluding the impacts of favorable currency variations of 5 percentage points, total general and administrative expenses decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower
stock-based compensation expenses resulting from changes in expense classification as noted in the Research and Development Expenses discussion above and also due to lower variable compensation expenses. These decreases were partially offset by
increased constant currency salaries expenses resulting from increased headcount. Amortization of Intangible
Assets:    Substantially all of our intangible assets are acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets.
We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a reduction in
expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. These decreases were partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our acquisitions of MICROS in the
second quarter of fiscal 2015, among others. Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses:    Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for
transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other
operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses result from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon
termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

On a constant currency basis, the increase in acquisition related and other expenses during the first quarter of fiscal
2016 was due to an increase in certain transitional employee related costs, primarily related to our acquisition of MICROS. Restructuring Expenses:    Restructuring expenses result from the execution of management approved restructuring plans
that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate
facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report.

Restructuring expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring
expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily related to our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated these plans in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. The total
estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan are up to $626 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated
remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan were approximately $443 million as of August 31, 2015 and the majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2016. Actions pursuant
to the 2013 Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of May 31, 2015 (Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 contains additional
information pertaining to our 2013 Restructuring Plan). Our estimated costs are subject to change in future periods. Interest Expense:

Interest expense increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from
our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in May 2015 and, to a lesser extent, our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 2014. The increases in interest expense during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 were partially offset by
reductions in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and the related fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in July 2014. Non-Operating Income, net:    Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests
in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and
net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 increased due to higher
interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances, lower net foreign currency losses and lower noncontrolling interests in income. These non-operating income increases were partially offset by certain
other losses, net, including losses on our deferred compensation investments that we hold and classify as trading. Provision for Income
Taxes:    Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax
computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, acquisition related settlements with tax
authorities and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws
and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Provision for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 increased, relative to the provision for income taxes
during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, due in substantial part to an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and the effects of certain acquisition related settlements with

tax authorities in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 that were not present in the current period. These effects are substantially offset by the effects of a lower net income before provision for
income taxes during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working capital:    The decrease in working capital as of August 31, 2015 in
comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to cash used for repurchases of our common stock and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These unfavorable working capital movements were partially
offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and
timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:    Cash and cash equivalents
primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and
certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at August 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was due to cash flows generated from our operations and, to a lesser extent, cash inflows from
stock option exercises, both of which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These cash increases were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders, both of which
occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $44.8 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2015, a significant portion of which was generated from the earnings of
these foreign subsidiaries that we consider as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings that are considered as indefinitely reinvested overseas would be subject to U.S. income tax if
repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign
subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our
consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major
international currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of August 31, 2015 relative to
what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2015 balance sheet date. Days sales outstanding, which we
calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 37 days at August 31, 2015 compared with 47 days at May 31, 2015. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of revenue
adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware support obligations to fair value. The decline in days sales
outstanding was primarily due to strong collections in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 and seasonality resulting in a large volume of software license and software support balances outstanding as of May 31, 2015.

Table of Contents
Cash flows from operating activities:    Our largest source of operating
cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of
the contracts terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support
arrangements, and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily due to
the cash unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate variances on net income of 12 percentage points during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and due to certain cash unfavorable changes in working capital balances, primarily cash
unfavorable movements associated with trade receivables, accounts payable and income taxes, relative to the corresponding changes for these items in the prior year period. Cash flows from investing activities:    The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our
investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash used for investing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales
and maturities) and an increase in capital expenditures to support our cloud offerings and research and development functions. Cash
flows from financing activities:    The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net
proceeds related to employee stock programs. We used net cash for financing activities of $3.3 billion during the first quarter of fiscal 2016
in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $6.5 billion during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The change in financing activities cash flows during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 in comparison to the corresponding prior year
period was primarily related to debt for which we received $8.5 billion of net cash proceeds during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 (in comparison to none during the first quarter of fiscal 2016) and due to an increase in stock repurchase activity
during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Free cash flow:    To
supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases
for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from
operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows:

Long-Term Customer Financing:     We offer certain of our customers the option to
acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within
90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of

these financing receivables. We financed $131 million and $156 million, respectively, or approximately 11% of our new software licenses revenues in each of the first quarters of fiscal 2016 and
2015, and $40 million and $26 million, respectively, or approximately 7% and 4%, respectively of our hardware products revenues in the first quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015. Contractual Obligations:    During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, there were no significant changes to our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual
obligations and commitments as presented in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our
working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:    We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of
existing stockholders. We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to
control the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2012 has been a weighted average
annualized rate of 1.9% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited
by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the
outstanding stock options at August 31, 2015, which generally have a 10-year exercise period, 13.6% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than
offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or
for other purposes. At August 31, 2015, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including
stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 11.0%. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:    Based on our managements evaluation (with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officers, one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Principal Executive
Officers) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting:    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls:    Our management,
including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
In addition to
the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. The
risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future.
Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 18, 2014, we announced that our Board of
Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $13.0 billion. Approximately $6.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of August 31, 2015, pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our
working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to
time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended August 31, 2015 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock
repurchase program:

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements
For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms Oracle, we, us and our refer to Oracle Corporation and
its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:


 
 our expectation to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies;


 
 our expectation that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase;


 
 our belief that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow;


 
 our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business;


 
 our international operations providing a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses;


 
 our expectation to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities, including those related to
hardware products and services;


 
 the sufficiency of our sources of funding for acquisitions or other matters;


 
 our belief that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and that any tax settlement will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations;


 
 our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any;


 
 our expectation to incur the majority of the remaining expenses pursuant to the Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan through the remainder of fiscal
2014 and our expectation to improve efficiencies in our operations that will impact our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan;


 
 our expectation that to the extent customers renew support contracts or cloud software subscriptions contracts, we will recognize revenues for the full
contracts values over the respective renewal periods;


 
 our experience and ability to predict quarterly hardware systems products revenues;


 
 the timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to manufacture or deliver a few large transactions substantially affecting the amount of
hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we will report;
as well as other statements
regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates, will, is designed to and similar expressions. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to
risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our business that could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by us in our fiscal year 2014, which runs from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014.
We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except
to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New
information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date
of this Quarterly Report.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Basis of Presentation We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
However, we believe that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and
the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. We believe that all necessary
adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2014.
There have been no significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements or to our significant
accounting policies that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 that have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect our
consolidated total revenues, consolidated operating income or consolidated net income. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software
Subscriptions Revenues New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and
middleware and our applications software products. Cloud software subscriptions revenues represent fees earned from granting customers access to select Oracle software applications and software platforms on a subscription basis through a cloud-based
computing environment. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues for the three and six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

Included in acquisition related and other expenses for the three and six months ended November 30, 2012 were changes
in estimates for contingent consideration payable related to an acquisition, which reduced acquisition related and other expenses by $145 million and $129 million for the three and six months ended November 30, 2012, respectively (see Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for additional information). Acquisition related and other expenses during the six months ended November 30,
2012 also included a benefit of $306 million related to certain litigation (see Note 14 for additional information), which reduced our acquisition related and other expenses in this period. Non-Operating Income, net Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income,
net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized

Sales of Financing Receivables We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these
contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates

of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these
financing receivables. Financing receivables sold to financial institutions were $216 million and $1.0 billion for the three and six months ended November 30, 2013, respectively, and $192 million and $1.2 billion for the three and six months
ended November 30, 2012, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits:     In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11, Presentation
of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11) to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits. ASU 2013-11 requires an entity to
present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows: to the extent a net
operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a
tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial
statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2015 with earlier adoption permitted. ASU 2013-11 should be applied prospectively with retroactive
application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2013-11 on our consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions During the first half of fiscal 2014, we acquired certain companies primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not individually significant. We have included the
financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates and the results from each of these companies were not individually or collectively material to our consolidated financial
statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminary purchase price for these acquisitions was $1.8 billion, which consisted primarily of cash consideration, and we preliminarily recorded $131 million of net tangible liabilities, related primarily to
deferred tax liabilities, $954 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $99 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated fair values, and $923 million of residual goodwill. In addition, as of November 30, 2013, we have agreed to acquire certain companies for amounts that are not material to our business and expect to
close such acquisitions within the next twelve months. The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
for our acquisitions completed during the first half of fiscal 2014 were based upon preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions for each of these acquisitions are subject to change as we obtain additional information
for our estimates during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that were not yet finalized related to certain tangible assets and liabilities
acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters and income and non-income based taxes. Fiscal 2013 Acquisitions
Acquisition of Acme Packet, Inc. On March 28, 2013, we completed our acquisition of Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet), a provider of session border control technology. We have included the financial results of Acme Packet in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total preliminary purchase price for Acme Packet was approximately

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)
November 30, 2013
(Unaudited)

$2.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $2.1 billion in cash and $12 million for the fair value of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. We have preliminarily recorded
$257 million of net tangible assets, $525 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $45 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.3 billion of residual goodwill. Acquisition of Eloqua, Inc. On
February 8, 2013, we completed our acquisition of Eloqua, Inc. (Eloqua), a provider of cloud-based marketing automation and revenue performance management software. We have included the financial results of Eloqua in our consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. The total preliminary purchase price for Eloqua was approximately $935 million, which consisted of approximately $933 million in cash and $2 million for the fair value of stock options assumed. We have
preliminarily recorded $1 million of net tangible assets and $327 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $607 million of residual goodwill. Other Fiscal 2013 Acquisitions During fiscal 2013, we acquired certain other
companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate. The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for certain acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 were based upon
preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions for each of these acquisitions are subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the
respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that were not yet finalized related to certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters and income and non-income
based taxes. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, Acme Packet, Eloqua and certain other companies that we acquired since the
beginning of fiscal 2013 (which were considered significant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure) as though the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2013. The pro forma financial information for
all periods presented also included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions including our amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which were preliminary), stock-based compensation
charges for unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2013. The pro forma financial information as
presented below is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2013. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended November 30, 2013 combined the historical results of Oracle for the
three and six months ended November 30, 2013, the historical results of certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2014 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were
acquired by us, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six
months ended November 30, 2012 combined the historical results of Oracle for the three and six months ended November 30, 2012, the historical results of Acme Packet for the three and six months ended December 31, 2012 (due to
differences in reporting periods), the historical results of Eloqua for the three and six months ended September 30, 2012 (due to differences in

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy
that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

 

 
 Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

 

 
 Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities; or 

 

 
 Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or
liabilities. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and 2 inputs are
defined above):

Our marketable securities investments consisted of Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate
debt securities and certain other securities. As of November 30, 2013 and May 31, 2013, approximately 77% and 91%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 23% and 9%, respectively, mature within
one to four years. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our marketable securities that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments exist. Our
valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that are
corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including
LIBOR-based yield curves, among others. Based on the trading prices of our $24.2 billion and $18.5 billion of borrowings, which consisted of
senior notes that were outstanding as of November 30, 2013 and May 31, 2013, respectively, the estimated fair values of our borrowings using Level 2 inputs at November 30, 2013 and May 31, 2013 were $25.7 billion and $20.7
billion, respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER BORROWINGS
Senior Notes In July
2013, we issued 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of November 30, 2013) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of 1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025
Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. We issued the Euro Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends
on our common stock and future acquisitions. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap
agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion

12

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)

(Unaudited)

with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 9 for additional information). Further, we designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our
international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. Refer to
Note 9 for additional information. In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes
due January 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes). The 2019 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month
LIBOR plus 0.58% (0.82% as of November 30, 2013) with interest payable quarterly. We issued these senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future
acquisitions. The effective interest yield of the 2019 Notes was 2.44% and interest is payable semi-annually. In July 2013, we entered into
certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable (0.90% at November 30, 2013;
see Note 9 for additional information). The effective interest yield of the 2021 Notes was 2.33% (3.53% after the economic effects of the cross-currency swap agreements described above and in Note 9) and interest is payable annually. The effective
interest yields of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes at November 30, 2013 were 3.73% and 3.17%, respectively. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually whereas interest on the 2025 Notes is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of
the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2025 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) prior to their maturity subject to the payment of an applicable make-whole premium. The 2019 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed prior to their maturity.
The Senior Notes and the 2019 Floating Rate Notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial
paper program and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for
further information on our commercial paper program and other borrowings). All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes and the 2019 Floating Rate Notes and any
future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at November 30, 2013. There have been
no other significant changes in our notes payable or other borrowing arrangements that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Our
management subsequently amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the
2013 Restructuring Plan are $705 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $99 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2013
Restructuring Plan in the first half of fiscal 2014 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $281 million through the remainder of fiscal 2014. Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2013 Restructuring Plan will be
reflected in our future results of operations.

Deferred software license updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware systems support revenues represent
customer payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our
services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements,
customer specific acceptance provisions, customer payments

made in advance for time-based arrangements including cloud software subscriptions offerings that are typically billed in advance and recognized over the corresponding contractual term, and
software license transactions that cannot be segmented from undelivered consulting or other services. In connection with our acquisitions, we
have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscriptions, software license updates and product support, and hardware systems support obligations assumed from our acquired companies. We have estimated the fair values of the obligations
assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory,
the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the acquired obligations. The aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the new software licenses and cloud software
subscriptions, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize
over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.

9.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value HedgesInterest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on
these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 3.75% senior notes
due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements
pertain to match, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as
qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they
protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated
statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities for the 2014 Notes, and other assets or other non-current liabilities for the 2019 Notes in our consolidated
balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current and other current
borrowings for the 2014 Notes, and notes payable and other non-current borrowings for the 2019 Notes. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense.
We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes. Cash Flow HedgesCross Currency Swap Agreements In connection with the
issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and
the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the
principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC
815. The

15

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)

critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same
time as the 2021 Notes. We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The
fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income, net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro
denominated 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately to non-operating income, net. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the six months ended November 30, 2013. We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes. Net Investment
HedgeForeign Currency Borrowings In July 2013, we designated our Euro denominated 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our
investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect
to the U.S. Dollar. We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting
period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying
value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any
ineffectiveness for the six months ended November 30, 2013. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward
contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant
to ASC 815 (refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for additional information regarding these contracts). As of November 30, 2013
and May 31, 2013, respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of
forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $719 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. As of November 30, 2013, the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell certain
other currencies, except U.S. Dollars, in exchange for Indian Rupees was a U.S. dollar equivalent of $64 million (none as of May 31, 2013). The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at November 30,
2013 and May 31, 2013. Included in our non-operating income, net were $77 million and $9 million of net losses related to these forward contracts for the three and six months ended November 30, 2013, respectively, and $18 million and $51
million of net losses for the three and six months ended November 30, 2012, respectively.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Stock Repurchases Our
Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion.
Approximately $8.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of November 30, 2013, pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 176.1 million shares for $5.8 billion during the six months ended November 30, 2013
(including 2.7 million shares for $97 million that were repurchased but not settled) and 200.3 million shares for $6.1 billion during the six months ended November 30, 2012 under the stock repurchase program.

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase
activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchase of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock
repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Dividends on Common Stock During the
six months ended November 30, 2013, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock, which we paid during the same period. In December 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on January 28, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of
business on January 7, 2014. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuation of Stock Options Stock-based compensation
is included in the following operating expense line items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations:

During the first half of fiscal 2014, we issued 120 million stock options (including our annual grant of stock
options in our first quarter of fiscal 2014 and certain stock options assumed from companies that we acquired). These stock option-based award issuances were partially offset by forfeitures and cancellations of 17 million shares during the
first half of fiscal 2014.

We estimate the fair values of our share-based payments using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award,
which is generally four years. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination. The weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of
our stock options were as follows for the three and six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012:

The expected life input is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free
interest rate input is based on U.S. Treasury instruments, the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors and the volatility input is calculated based on the implied volatility of our
publicly traded options.

INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate for the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a
broad range of income tax rates. Our provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes,
the U.S. research and development tax credit, acquisition related settlements with tax authorities and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Our effective tax rate was 20.3% and 19.1% for the three and six months ended November 30,
2013, respectively, and 21.3% and 22.9% for the three and six months ended November 30, 2012, respectively. Our net deferred tax assets
were $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of November 30, 2013 and May 31, 2013, respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred
tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change. Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2012. Our U.S. federal and, with some
exceptions, our state income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2000 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax
examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1998. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably
foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We are organized geographically and by line of business. While our Chief Executive Officer evaluates results in a number of different ways, the line of business
management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. We have three businessessoftware, hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments.
Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions and (2) software license updates and product support. Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating
segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. All other operating segments are combined under our services business. The new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions line of business is engaged in licensing our database and middleware software and our applications software, and providing access to a broad
range of our software offerings on a subscription basis through a cloud-based computing environment. Database and middleware software generally include database and database management software; application server and cloud application software;
Service-Oriented Architecture and business process management software; business intelligence software; identity and access management software; data integration software; web experience management, portals, content management and social network
software; and development tools. Our database and middleware software product offerings also include Java, which is a global software development platform used in a wide range of computers, networks and devices. Applications software provides
enterprise information that enables companies to manage and automate core business functions. Oracle Applications address specific business and industry requirements including human capital and talent management; customer experience and customer
relationship management; financial management and governance, risk and compliance; procurement; project portfolio management; supply chain management; business analytics and enterprise performance management; and industry-specific applications.
Oracle Cloud is a comprehensive set of cloud service offerings that is designed to provide customers and partners with access to application services, social networking services, platform services and common infrastructure services on a subscription
basis that we manage, host and support. The software license updates and product support line of business provides customers with rights to
software product upgrades and maintenance releases, patches released, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period. The hardware systems products line of business consists primarily of servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems including
the Oracle Solaris Operating System and management software to support diverse information technology (IT) environments, including public and private cloud computing environments. As a part of this line of business, we offer our Oracle Engineered
Systems, including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine, Oracle SPARC SuperCluster, Oracle Database Appliance, and Oracle Big Data Appliance, which are the core building blocks for
Oracles data center and cloud computing products and services. Our hardware systems support line of business provides customers with
software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical
support services. Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting, managed cloud services
and education services. Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in

business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Oracle managed cloud
services provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services including deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner
data centers, or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Education
services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. We do not track our assets by operating segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. Certain costs have been reclassified in the presentation of our segment reporting for the fiscal 2013 periods presented to align with our current line of
business management structure.

 Operating segment revenues generally differ from the external reporting
classifications due to certain software license products that are classified as service revenues for management reporting purposes. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues for management reporting included revenues related to
cloud software subscriptions contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations in the amounts of $3
million and $12 million for the three months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $7 million and $31 million for the six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Software license updates and product support

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted
stock-based awards and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
SAP Intellectual Property Litigation On March 22, 2007, Oracle Corporation, Oracle USA, Inc. and Oracle International Corporation (collectively, Oracle) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against SAP AG, its wholly-owned subsidiary, SAP America, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TomorrowNow, Inc., (the SAP Subsidiary, and collectively, the SAP Defendants) alleging that SAP unlawfully accessed Oracles Customer
Connection support website and improperly took and used Oracles intellectual property. Trial commenced on November 1, 2010 on the
issue of damages, as SAP had stipulated to liability. The jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion. On September 1, 2011, the court granted the SAP Defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. The court vacated the $1.3
billion award and held that Oracle could either accept a reduced amount or remittitur of $272 million or proceed to a new trial. On February 6, 2012, Oracle rejected the remittitur and requested a new trial. On August 2, 2012, Oracle and the SAP Defendants stipulated to a judgment of $306 million against the SAP Defendants, in lieu of having a second jury
trial, while preserving both parties rights to appeal prior court orders. We recorded a $306 million non-current receivable, included in other assets, in our consolidated balance sheet and we recognized a corresponding benefit to our results
of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Previously during trial we received payment of $120 million in attorneys fees from SAP under a stipulation, and we recorded this payment upon receipt as a benefit to our results of operations
during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. On August 3, 2012, the court entered the judgment and vacated the date set for the new trial. Oracle filed a Notice of Appeal on August 31, 2012, and the SAP Defendants filed a notice of appeal on
September 14, 2012. The SAP Defendants subsequently dismissed their appeal. Oracles appeal has been fully briefed. The appellate court has not yet scheduled a date for oral argument.

Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action
including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged that
when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark
Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd
Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on
December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had
misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court
issued a final statement of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itanium-based servers and to port such products at
no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision. The issues of breach, HPs performance, causation and damages, HPs tort claims, and Oracles cross-claims will all be tried
before a jury. As of April 8, 2013, the trial is stayed pending Oracles appeal of the courts denial of its anti-SLAPP motion, which is fully briefed, although oral argument has not yet been scheduled. We cannot currently estimate a
reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it. Derivative Litigations and Related Action Various stockholder derivative lawsuits were
filed against Oracle and certain former and current directors in connection with a qui tam lawsuit that had been filed against Oracle in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The qui tam action alleged that Oracle
made false statements to the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1997-1998 while negotiating its GSA contract, among other claims. Oracle settled this action without admitting liability, and the case was dismissed on October 11, 2011. The
following stockholder derivative actions were filed, claiming that the named officer and director defendants were responsible for certain alleged conduct in the qui tam action and thereby exposing Oracle to reputational damage, monetary damages and
costs and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control and unjust enrichment: on August 2, 2010, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; on
August 19, 2010, a similar stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in California Superior Court, County of San Mateo; and on September 8, 2011, another stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California. The first two derivative actions were consolidated, but pursuant to a motion by Oracle, they were dismissed on November 11, 2011, with leave to plaintiffs to amend. No amended complaint was filed. On September 12, 2011, two alleged stockholders of Oracle filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate for Inspection of Corporate Books and Records
in California Superior Court, County of San Mateo. The petition originally named as respondents Oracle and two of our officers, both of whom were subsequently dismissed. The alleged stockholders claimed that they were investigating alleged corporate
mismanagement relating to the claims in the qui tam action, and asked the court to compel the inspection of certain of Oracles accounting books and records and minutes of meetings of the stockholders, our Board of Directors and the committees
of our Board

of Directors, related to those allegations, plus expenses of the audit and attorneys fees. At a hearing on November 10, 2011, the court granted the alleged stockholders request
for a Writ of Mandate, which was confirmed in a judgment on December 12, 2011. Oracle filed a notice of appeal on February 2, 2012. The derivative and Writ of Mandate actions discussed above have been settled and are now concluded. On September 26, 2013, the United States District
Court held a final fairness hearing and approved the settlement, and on September 30, 2013, the court dismissed with prejudice the derivative cases discussed above. On November 5, 2013, the San Mateo Superior Court entered an order
vacating its December 12, 2011, judgment and dismissing the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. Under the settlement, Oracle will continue or implement certain corporate governance measures, which shall remain in place for three years, and
Oracle paid plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs of $1.9 million. On September 30, 2011, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was
filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and a second stockholder was permitted to intervene as a plaintiff on November 15, 2011. At an August 22, 2012, hearing, the court dismissed certain claims but permitted certain claims for breach of
fiduciary duty to proceed. On May 3, 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The derivative suit is brought by two alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracles behalf, against one former director and all but two of our
current directors, including against our Chief Executive Officer as an alleged controlling stockholder. Plaintiffs allege that Oracles directors breached their fiduciary duties in agreeing to purchase Pillar Data Systems, Inc. at an excessive
price. Oracles acquisition of Pillar is structured as an earn out, under which Oracle is scheduled to make a single payment, if any, by November 30, 2014, to Pillars former shareholders based on an agreed-upon earn-out formula.
Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, rescission of the Pillar Data transaction, damages, disgorgement of our Chief Executive Officers alleged profits, disgorgement of all compensation earned by defendants as a result of their service on
Oracles Board or any committee of the Board, and an award of attorneys fees and costs. On September 19, 2013, the defendants
in the Pillar derivative case filed a third-party complaint against Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, London, Syndicates 623 and 2623 (Beazley), who had issued a directors and officers insurance policy to Oracle. The
third-party complaint alleged that Beazley improperly denied coverage by refusing to pay a reasonable amount to settle the derivative case. The third-party complaint seeks declaratory relief, damages, and attorneys fees and costs. On
October 2, 2013, plaintiffs and defendants in the Pillar derivative case filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release, under which our Chief Executive Officer agreed to pay to Oracle 95% of any and all amounts, if
any, that are paid to him under the Pillar earn out. The settlement is subject to approval by the Delaware Chancery Court. The settlement also is expressly conditioned on Beazleys agreeing to pay, or Beazleys being ordered by a court to
pay, any plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs awarded by the Court by April 1, 2014. Beazley filed a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint, and the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a declaration
that Beazley is obligated to pay on behalf of Oracles directors an award of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs up to the insurance policys $20 million limit. Both motions are fully briefed, and oral argument has been
scheduled for January 8, 2014. Because of the parties conditional settlement, the court canceled the derivative trial that had been
scheduled for November 18 to 22, 2013. While the outcome of the derivative litigation and the related action noted above cannot be
predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any. Other Litigation We are party to
various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are
attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of
amounts already recognized, if any.

Item 2.    Managements Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and
judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the worlds largest provider of enterprise software and a
leading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware as well as web-based
applications, virtualization, clustering and large-scale systems management. We provide cloud services as well as software and hardware products to other cloud service providers, both public and private. Oracle database and middleware software,
applications software and hardware systemsincluding computer server, storage and networking productsare the building blocks of our own cloud services, our partners cloud services and our customers private cloud environments.
Our customers can subscribe to use select Oracle software and hardware products through our cloud offerings, or purchase our software and hardware products and related services to build their own cloud or on-premise information technology (IT)
environments. Our strategy is to deliver reliable and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently. We also pursue new or emerging growth opportunities in order to
maintain technology leadership. Offering customers a choice in how they use our products and serviceswhile maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and interoperabilityis important to our corporate strategy. We believe that internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our
long-term strategic plans. We continue to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability and security to our customers. For example,
Oracle Engineered Systems, which include our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SPARC SuperCluster products, among others, combine certain of our hardware and software offerings in a way that increases
computing performance relative to our competitors products, creating time savings, efficiencies and operational cost advantages for our customers. With products that are engineered to work together, our customers can reduce much of the
complexity of IT and make available resources they would otherwise spend on IT operations. In addition to our introductions of new, innovative hardware and software products, we also continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer choice through
ongoing enhancements to our existing products, including our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards applications software products. We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base,
provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add
to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. We are organized into three businessessoftware, hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique
characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Software Business Our
software business, which represented 75% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions and (2) software license updates and product
support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and subscription offerings,

our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our
acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software
Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions:    We license our database and middleware, as well as our applications software, and provide access to a broad range of our software offerings through cloud software
subscriptions contracts. Our software solutions are substantially built on a standards-based, integrated architecture that is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our software products are
substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third
party UNIX products, among others. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to
offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. The growth in new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints,
the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software licenses transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software
license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues. Since our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to
predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period provides additional visibility into the
underlying performance of this business segment. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 28% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts are generally one to
three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segments margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters
within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new
software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segments margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscriptions obligations that we assumed in our business combinations
(described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. For
certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce cloud software subscriptions obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not
recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to cloud software subscriptions contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $3 million and $12 million for the three
months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $7 million and $31 million for the six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud software subscriptions contracts are renewed with us
following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud software subscriptions contracts over their respective contractual periods. Software License Updates and Product Support:    Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades
and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and substantially all of our
customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support
contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from
companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 47% of our total revenues on a
trailing 4-quarter basis, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins over the trailing 4-quarters were 89% and accounted for 76% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support
margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that
software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: 

 

 
 substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal;


 

 
 substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a
further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods
assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which
add to our software support contract base; and 

 

 
 our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.
We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair
values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise
recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $1 million and $4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $1 million and $8 million for the six months ended
November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective
support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our
hardware business represented 14% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to
produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new
hardware products and services. Hardware Systems Products:    We provide a broad selection of hardware
systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including public and private cloud computing environments. We engineer our
hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems.
Oracle Engineered Systems are core building blocks for Oracles data center and cloud computing products and services. Oracle Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), an on-premise cloud offering for deploying Oracles Engineered Systems to
customers on a subscription basis, provides our customers with flexibility in deployment models and allows our customers to cost effectively handle peak computing workloads with capacity on demand. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are differentiated
by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and 
large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally
intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SPARC SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are also compatible with Oracle
Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 systems are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics
In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore
customers mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems
environments. Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet
technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We
also offer products and services for communications networks including network signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, amongst others. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers.
To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our
internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other
manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control
processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of
components across product types and a build-to-order manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to
proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating margins that we report are affected by our
strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In
addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware
transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support:    Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software
components that are essential to the functionality of our server, storage and networking products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of
factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems 
support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our
acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.
Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value
adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for
contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million and $3 million for
the three months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $10 million and $8 million for the six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with
us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods. Services Business Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our
operating segments and offers consulting services, managed cloud services and education services. Our services business, which represented 11% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, has lower margins than our software and hardware
businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending
and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our consulting line of business is designed to help our customers more
successfully architect and deploy our products. Our consulting services include business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and
upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products to which
they relate and are performed after the customers purchase of the products. Our services revenues as they relate to consulting services are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of our product revenues, in particular the new
software licenses sales of our application products. Oracle managed cloud services provide comprehensive software and hardware management and
maintenance servicesincluding deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade servicesfor customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer
facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. We believe that our managed cloud services offerings provide
our customers with greater value and choice through increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and
services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and
use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. Acquisitions
An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions
of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Tekelec Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013,
amongst others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our
revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in 
furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report provides additional information related to our
pending and recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash
flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as
set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the
time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more
significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:

 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which
managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors. During the first half of fiscal 2014, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 provides a more complete discussion
of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in the second
quarter and first half of fiscal 2014 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2013 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2014 compared to the same periods
of fiscal 2013, we quantify the contributions of our acquired products (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in new software licenses and cloud software 
subscriptions revenues, hardware systems products revenues and hardware systems support revenues. The incremental contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating
segments revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the
periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as the quantified amounts themselves, may
provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: 

 

 
 the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration
efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and 

 

 
 although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support
contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscriptions contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions deferred
revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue
improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Seasonality
Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force
incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. Our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses
are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term.
Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by
changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the
results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are
converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2013, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an
entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on November 30, 2013 and 2012, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.35 million in the first half of fiscal 2014 (using 1.35 as the
month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.29 million in the first half of fiscal 2013 (using 1.29 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the results for the three and
six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012 using the May 31, 2013 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded
results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses

 Asia Pacific includes Japan Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign
currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, our total revenues increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 by 3 percentage points due to an increase in our software business revenues, which was attributable to growth in our new software
licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions, and growth in our software license updates and product support revenues; and an increase in our hardware systems business revenues
attributable to growth in hardware systems support revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the contribution of our software and hardware businesses revenues to our total revenues growth
in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was partially offset by decreases in revenues from our services businesses. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 84% and EMEA contributed 16% to our total revenues growth during the second
quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total operating expenses
increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses due to higher employee related expenses associated with increased headcount, and an increase in acquisition
related and other expenses due primarily to a $145 million acquisition related benefit recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 that decreased our expenses in that period (described further below). These expense increases were partially
offset by constant currency expense decreases during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily in our services business due to lower employee related costs attributable to decreased headcount and lower external contractor expenses; lower hardware
systems support costs as a result of lower employee related costs due to reduced headcount and reduced delivery costs; and lower restructuring expenses. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our operating margin was flat and our operating
margin as a percentage of revenues decreased during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 as our total operating expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, our total
revenues increased by 4 percentage points in the first half of fiscal 2014 due to an increase in our software business revenues due to the same reasons as noted above. On a constant currency basis, the contribution of our software business revenues
to our total revenues growth in the first half of fiscal 2014 was partially offset by decreases in revenues from our hardware systems and services businesses. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 80%, EMEA contributed 8% and Asia
Pacific contributed 12% to the increase in our total revenues during the first half of fiscal 2014.

Table of Contents
Excluding the effect of favorable foreign
currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total operating expenses increased on a net basis during the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to similar reasons as noted above; a $306 million benefit relating to certain litigation that
decreased our acquisition related and other expenses during the first half of fiscal 2013 (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information), partially offset
by expense decreases due to a decrease in hardware systems products expenses associated with lower hardware revenues.
Excluding the effect of
foreign currency rate fluctuations, our operating margin increased during the first half of fiscal 2014 due to the increase in our total revenues. However, on a constant currency basis, our operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased
during the first half of fiscal 2014 as our total operating expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. Supplemental
Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is
helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre-
and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses
related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense and income items:

 In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscriptions, software support and hardware systems
support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as
independent entities in the amounts of $3 million and $12 million for the three months ended November 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and $7 million and $31 million for the six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We
also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $1 million and $4 million
for the three months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $1 million and $8 million for the six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues
related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by 

 

the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million and $3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $10 million and $8
million for the six months ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 

    
Approximately $8 million and $3 million of estimated cloud software subscriptions revenues related to contracts assumed will not be recognized during the remainder of
fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $2
million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during each of the remainder of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain
acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values
over the respective contracts renewal periods.

 Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based
compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. In the first half of fiscal 2013,
acquisition related and other expenses included a benefit of $306 million related to certain litigation (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information), and
a net benefit of $129 million due to a change in the fair value of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our
fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for additional information).

 The significant majority of restructuring expenses during the periods presented for the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013 related to employee
severance and facility exit costs in connection with our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 7 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

 The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the
respective periods presented. Income tax effects for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.9%,
instead of 20.3%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our condensed consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects 

 

of acquisition related items, including the tax effect of amortization of intangible assets. Income tax effects for the first half of fiscal 2014 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate
of 21.9%, instead of 19.1%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our condensed consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effect of amortization of
intangible assets. Income tax effects for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.5%, instead of 21.3%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our condensed consolidated statement of
operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effect of amortization of intangible assets. Income tax effects for the first half of fiscal 2013 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of
23.5%, instead of 22.9%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our condensed consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of
intangible assets, partially offset by the disproportionate tax rate impact of certain discrete items for the period. Software Business Our software business
consists of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment and software license updates and product support segment. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions:    New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from
granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our applications software products. Cloud software subscriptions revenues represent fees earned from granting customers access to a broad range of our software offerings on a
subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment that includes access, hosting, infrastructure management, the use of software updates, and support. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and
internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Expenses associated with our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues are included in sales and
marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the cost of providing cloud software subscriptions services and amortization
of intangible assets.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    Excluding the effect
of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased by 1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 due substantially to incremental revenues from our recent
acquisitions. In constant currency, growth in revenues in the Americas and EMEA regions was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Asia Pacific region. In reported currency, our new software licenses revenues were $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in the second quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, and our cloud software subscriptions revenues were
$259 million and $218 million in the second quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. In constant currency, our new software 
license revenues were flat and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased by 20% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions.
In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $64 million of growth to our total new software licenses and cloud software
subscriptions revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2014. In constant currency, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions increased over the trailing 4-quarters by 2% primarily due to revenue contributions from our recent
acquisitions. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud software subscriptions obligations to their
estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud software subscriptions revenues in the amounts of $3 million and $12 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our
acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in the second quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud software subscriptions contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will
recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud software subscriptions contracts over the respective contractual periods. In reported
currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater represented 27% of our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in each of the second quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013.
Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total new software licenses and cloud software
subscriptions expenses increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher employee related expenses including higher salaries and variable compensation expenses from increased headcount. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of
revenues decreased during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 as our total expenses associated with this segment increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total new software
licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased by 4 percentage points in the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, growth in revenues in the Americas region
was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Asia Pacific region, while revenues in the EMEA region were flat. In reported currency,
our new software licenses revenues were $3.5 billion in each of the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and our cloud software subscriptions revenues were $513 million and $421 million in the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. In
constant currency, our new software licenses revenues and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased by 2% and 23%, respectively, in the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. In reported
currency, cloud software subscriptions revenues in the amounts of $7 million and $31 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013,
respectively, due to business combination accounting rules. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $145 million of growth
to our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues during the first half of fiscal 2014. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 3% in the first
half of fiscal 2014 and represented 25% of our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in each of the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased, and margin and margin as a percentage
of revenues decreased, during the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. Software License Updates
and Product Support:    Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the support period. Product support includes internet
access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and 
product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software
support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    Excluding the
effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, software license updates and product support revenues increased by 7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all
customers electing to purchase software support contracts during the trailing 4-quarter period, and the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period. Excluding the
effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 54%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2014. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition
dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts in the amounts of $1 million and $4 million that would have been otherwise recorded
by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in the second quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software
support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of
which are one year in duration. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, total software
license updates and product support expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 modestly increased due to an increase in certain non-income based taxes, partially offset by a decrease in employee related costs due to a modest decrease in
headcount and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license
updates and product support margin increased during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased at a faster rate that than our total expenses. Margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment was flat in
comparison with the prior year period. First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    Excluding
the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 1 percentage point, software license updates and product support revenues increased by 8% in the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. Excluding the effect
of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during the first half of fiscal 2014. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support
contracts in the amounts of $1 million and $8 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses during the first half of fiscal
2014 modestly increased as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. Software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during the first half of fiscal
2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased at a faster rate in comparison to our total expenses. Hardware Systems Business
Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. Hardware Systems Products:    Hardware systems products revenues are
primarily generated from the sales of our computer server, storage and networking products, including sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such
as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products
by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses
associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of
intangible assets.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    Excluding the effect
of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems products revenues decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy product lines, including lower margin products.
These revenue decreases were partially offset by $56 million of incremental revenues from our recently acquired companies and increases in hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems during the second quarter of fiscal 2014.
Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products operating expenses increased in the second quarter of
fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses related primarily to increased sales and marketing headcount. Excluding
the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the decrease in our hardware revenues and the increase in total
expenses for this segment. First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    Excluding
the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products revenues decreased during the first half of fiscal 2014 due to the reasons noted above. Our recent acquisitions contributed $102 million of incremental revenues during the
first half of fiscal 2014. In constant currency, total operating expenses decreased in the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in hardware systems product costs associated with lower hardware revenues, partially offset by an
increase in employee related expenses due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount. Total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the decrease in our hardware revenues and the
increase in employee related expenses due to the increase in sales and marketing headcount. Hardware Systems
Support:    Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris and
certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer
products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

 Included as a component of Amortization of Intangible Assets in our condensed consolidated statements of operations
Excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems support revenues increased by
5 percentage points in each of the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2014, primarily due to incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions of $36 million and $69 million in the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2014,
respectively, partially offset by certain revenues decreases that were generally caused by the reductions in sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware systems product lines for which we offer hardware systems support. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the
acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $4 million and $3 million that would have been otherwise
reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in the second quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $10 million and $8 million were not recognized in the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013,
respectively. To the extent these 
underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses during the first half of fiscal 2014 decreased
primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount and reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, total hardware systems support expenses were
lower for similar reasons as the aforementioned, but on a constant currency basis were offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in the fiscal 2014 periods presented as our total revenues for this segment increased
while our total expenses for this segment were flat to down. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, managed cloud services and education services. Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to
customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Managed cloud services revenues are earned by providing
comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance servicesincluding deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade servicesfor customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data
centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Education
revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, media-based, internet-based and custom training in the use of our software and hardware products. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology
infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

 Included as a component of Amortization of Intangible Assets in our condensed consolidated statements of operations
Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased during the fiscal 2014 periods
presented due to revenue decreases in each of our services segments. The largest services revenues decreases in the fiscal 2014 periods presented were to our consulting segments revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total services expenses decreased during the fiscal
2014 periods presented primarily due to expense decreases in our consulting services segment attributable to decreases in employee related expenses due to decreased headcount, lower external contractor costs, and lower intangible asset amortization.
Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues
increased during the fiscal 2014 periods presented primarily due to decreases in our total expenses related to this segment. Research
and Development Expenses:    Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our
judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    On a constant currency basis, total general and administrative expenses increased modestly during
the second quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013 due primarily to slightly higher salaries and benefits expenses due to an increase in headcount. First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    On a constant currency basis, total general and administrative expenses decreased during the first half of
fiscal 2014 as compared to the first half of fiscal 2013 due primarily to lower variable compensation expenses and reductions in professional fees and certain other net operating expenses, partially offset by slightly higher salaries and benefits
due to an increase in headcount. Amortization of Intangible Assets:    Substantially all of our intangible
assets are purchased through our acquisitions. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review for potential impairment for these assets based upon
relevant facts and circumstances. For additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization, see Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased during the fiscal 2014 periods presented as certain of our intangible assets
pertaining to our acquisitions of BEA Systems, Inc. and Sun Microsystems, Inc. and certain other companies became fully amortized. These decreases were partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection
with our recent acquisitions. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses:    Acquisition related and other
expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the
measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from
acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    On a constant
currency basis, the increase in acquisition related and other expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition, which resulted in a
net benefit of $145 million that we recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for additional
information).
First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    On a constant currency basis,
the increase in our acquisition related and other expenses in the first half of fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the same reason as noted above and a $306 million benefit that we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to professional fees and
other, net related to certain litigation that decreased our expenses during that period (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information).
Restructuring expenses:    Restructuring expenses result from the execution of management approved restructuring plans
that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs

and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring
plans, see Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Restructuring expenses in the fiscal 2014 and 2013 periods presented primarily related to our 2013 Restructuring Plan,
which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014
to reflect additional actions that we expect to take to improve efficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan are $705 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense
line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan were approximately $281 million as of November 30, 2013. The majority
of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the remainder of fiscal 2014. Our estimated costs may be subject to change in future periods. Interest Expense:

Interest expense increased in the fiscal 2014 periods presented due to higher average borrowings resulting from our
issuance of $3.0 billion and 2.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013 and our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $1.25
billion of senior notes in April 2013 (see Recent Financing Activities below and Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our fiscal 2014
borrowings). Non-Operating Income, net:    Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income,
net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses) including net realized gains
and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    On a constant
currency basis, our non-operating income, net increased during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that we classify as trading that are held to support our deferred
compensation plan obligations, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses, and due to an increase in noncontrolling interests in income of our majority-owned subsidiaries. First Half Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    On a
constant currency basis our non-operating income, net increased during the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that are held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations
and a decrease in noncontrolling interests in income of our majority owned subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes:    Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of
income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and
development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in
tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2014 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2013:    Provision for
income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 decreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, due to a tax favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings, which was partially offset by an
income tax benefit related to an acquisition related item that we recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2013. First Half
Fiscal 2014 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2013:    Provision for income taxes for the first half of fiscal 2014 decreased, relative to the provision for income taxes for the first half of fiscal 2013, due to a tax
favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings and also due to the effect of acquisition related settlements with tax authorities during the fiscal 2014 period. Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working capital:    The increase in working capital as of November 30, 2013 in
comparison to May 31, 2013 was primarily due to our issuance of 2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2013, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during the first half of
fiscal 2014, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by the reclassification of $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from long-term to current, cash used for
repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions, all of which occurred during the first half of fiscal 2014. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in
future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities:    Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist
of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at November 30, 2013 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was due to an
increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of 2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by
$5.8 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $1.7 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions and $1.1 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders during the first half of fiscal 2014. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable

securities included $31.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of November 30, 2013, a significant portion of which was generated from the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries that
we consider as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings that are considered as indefinitely reinvested overseas would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States.
The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of
comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during the first half of fiscal 2014, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased as of November 30, 2013 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2013 balance sheet date. Days sales outstanding, which was calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 41 days at
November 30, 2013 compared with 50 days at May 31, 2013. The days sales outstanding calculation excluded the impact of revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud software subscriptions
obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. Our decline in days sales outstanding was primarily due to the collection, in our first half of fiscal 2014, of large
software license and software support balances outstanding as of May 31, 2013.

Cash flows from operating activities:    Our largest source of operating cash flows is
cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the
contracts terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software licenses sales and sales of hardware systems support arrangements, and to a lesser extent, sales of services, hardware systems
products, and cloud software subscriptions. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased
facilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the following, which in each
case compares the favorable cash impacts for the first half of fiscal 2014 to the first half of fiscal 2013: the cash favorable impacts of increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and
depreciation; additional cash inflows associated with arrangements for which revenues were initially deferred at the outset of the arrangements, primarily software support arrangements; and the impact of a reduction of contingent consideration
payable in connection with an acquisition (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for additional information) and the impact of a $306
million non-current receivable related to certain litigation (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information), both of which were recognized in the first
half of fiscal 2013.
Cash flows from investing activities:    The changes in cash flows from investing
activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support
our growth. Net cash used for investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal 2014 due to an increase in net cash used to purchase
marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in each case compared to the first half of fiscal 2013. Cash flows from financing activities:    The changes in cash flows from
financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash used for financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2014 decreased in comparison to the first half of fiscal 2013 primarily due to the repayment of $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings
pursuant to certain expired revolving credit facilities during the first half of fiscal 2013 (no repayments during the first half of fiscal 2014); a net increase in borrowings during the first half of fiscal 2014 (we issued 2.0 billion and
$3.0 billion of senior notes during the first half of fiscal 2014 in comparison to $5.0 billion of senior notes issued during the first half of fiscal 2013) and lower stock repurchase activity. These fiscal 2014 cash favorable variances were
partially offset by an increase in payments of cash dividends to stockholders in the first half of fiscal 2014 in comparison to the first half of fiscal 2013. Free cash flow:    To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze
cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as
an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows:

 Derived from capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities as per our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows
presented in accordance with GAAP. Long-Term Customer Financing:    We offer certain of
our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse
basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered
control of these financial assets. We financed $635 million and $491 million, respectively, or approximately 16% and 12%, respectively, of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013,
and $68 million and $64 million, respectively, or approximately 5% and 4%, respectively, of our hardware systems products revenues in the first half of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Recent Financing Activities: Senior Notes:    In July
2013, we issued 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of November 30, 2013) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of 1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025
Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. We are accounting for the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international
subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar pursuant to ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate
notes due January 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes, and together with the Floating Rate Notes and 2019 Notes, the U.S. Dollar
Notes). We issued the Euro Notes and the U.S. Dollar Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include
stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions. Additional details regarding the Euro Notes, the U.S. Dollar Notes, and related hedge accounting are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Interest Rate Swap Agreements:    In
July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based
on LIBOR. As of November 30, 2013, our 2019 Notes had an effective interest rate of 0.90% after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair
value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report. Cross Currency Swap Agreements:    In July 2013, in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we
entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at
maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes
at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. Additional details regarding our
senior notes and related cross-currency swap agreements are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Common Stock Repurchases:    Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of
Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. Approximately $8.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of November 30, 2013 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Our stock
repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations,
our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or
discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations:    During the first half of fiscal 2014, there were no
significant changes to our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as presented in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 other than those items noted under Recent Financing ActivitiesSenior Notes;Interest Rate Swap Agreements; andCross Currency Swap Agreements above.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our
working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:    We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of
existing stockholders. 
We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions. We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and
restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2010 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.9% per year.
The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company,
divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the outstanding stock options at
November 30, 2013, which generally have a 10-year exercise period, approximately 1.2% have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive
effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes.
At November 30, 2013, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where
the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 11.5%. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Expense Risk
In July 2013, we issued 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of November 30, 2013) of fixed rate senior notes and $3.0 billion of
senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes and $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the Recent Financing Activities section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (Item 2) in this Quarterly Report. Our total borrowings were $24.2 billion as of November 30, 2013, consisting of $23.7 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $500 million of floating rate borrowings. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated
with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have
the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical
terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as
fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 6 and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based
upon LIBOR. As of November 30, 2013, our 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes had effective interest rates of 1.32% and 0.90%, respectively, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall
level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of
assumed changes in market interest rates. As of November 30, 2013, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our 
interest expense annually by approximately $35 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign
Currency Transaction and Translation Risks In July 2013, we issued 1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and
we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a
fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6
billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. In July 2013, we also issued 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes).
We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the
changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion
is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Any remaining
change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income, net. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the first half of fiscal 2014. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the
2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar weakened by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of November 30, 2013, our obligation to settle the 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $101 million. There were no other significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the first half of fiscal 2014. Please
refer to Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 for a more complete discussion of the market risks we encounter.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:    Based on our managements evaluation (with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management
(including our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls:    Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are
effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A

control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
The material set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. The risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are
not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future.
Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of
Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. Approximately $8.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of November 30, 2013 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working
capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time
through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended November 30, 2013 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock
repurchase program:

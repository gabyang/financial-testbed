ITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.
Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.  Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as equity method or measurement alternative method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.  The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date in which the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation.  The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).The balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019.  The consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 and as of June 30, 2020 are unaudited, and in the opinion of management, include all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for interim periods.  The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  Reference should be made to the Mastercard Incorporated Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.Use of estimates -  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, including the potential impacts and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.  These financial statements were prepared using information reasonably available as of June 30, 2020 and through the date of this Report.  The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, net losses from non-controlling interests were not material and, as a result, amounts are included in the consolidated statement of operations within other income (expense).
Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
Simplifying the accounting for income taxes - In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued accounting guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes.  This guidance includes the removal of certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles and provides clarity and simplification to other areas of income tax accounting by amending the existing guidance.  The guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2020.  The Company expects to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2021 and is in the process of evaluating the potential effects this will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Reference Rate Reform - In March 2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current contract modifications and hedge accounting guidance in light of the expected market transition from LIBOR to alternative rates.  The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.  The transactions primarily include (1) contract modifications, (2) hedging relationships, and (3) sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity.  The amendments were effective immediately upon issuance of the update.  Companies may elect to adopt the amendments prospectively to transactions existing as of or entered from the date of adoption through December 31, 2022.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacted contracts, and the potential effects this will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2. Acquisitions
Businesses Acquired
During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company acquired businesses for $185 million in cash.  The Company is evaluating and finalizing the purchase accounting for these acquisitions.  The Company’s preliminary estimate of net assets acquired has been recorded primarily as intangible assets, including goodwill of $140 million that is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition dates.  The majority of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for local tax purposes.  Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the valuation techniques Mastercard utilizes to fair value the respective components of business combinations.In 2019, the Company acquired several businesses in separate transactions for total consideration of $1.5 billion.  As of June 30, 2020, the Company finalized the purchase accounting for certain businesses acquired during 2019 for total consideration of $783 million with no material adjustments from the preliminary estimated fair values.  For the preliminary estimated fair values of the purchase price allocations, as of the acquisition dates, refer to Note 2 (Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Pending Acquisitions
In June 2020, Mastercard entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Finicity Corporation (“Finicity”) for $825 million, subject to adjustments for cash and certain other liabilities at closing.  Finicity’s existing shareholders have the potential to receive an earn-out of up to an additional $160 million, if certain performance targets are met.  The pending acquisition is expected to enhance and expand the Company’s existing open banking platform by providing real-time access to financial data and insights.  Subject to satisfying certain closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In August 2019, Mastercard entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the majority of the Corporate Services business of Nets Denmark A/S for €2.85 billion (approximately $3.21 billion as of June 30, 2020), subject to adjustments for cash and certain other liabilities at closing.  The pending acquisition primarily comprises the clearing and instant payment services, and e-billing solutions of Nets Denmark A/S’s Corporate Services business.  The Company anticipates completing the acquisition in the third quarter of 2020 subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities held at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 primarily carried a credit rating of A- or better with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  The municipal securities are comprised of state tax-exempt bonds and are diversified across states and sectors.  Government and agency securities include U.S. government bonds, U.S. government sponsored agency bonds and foreign government bonds with similar credit quality to that of the U.S. government bonds.  Corporate securities are comprised of commercial paper and corporate bonds.  The asset-backed securities are investments in bonds which are collateralized primarily by automobile loan receivables.
The maturity distribution based on the contractual terms of the Company’s investment securities at June 30, 2020 was as follows:

Equity Investments
Included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet are equity investments with readily determinable fair values (“Marketable securities”) and equity investments without readily determinable fair values (“Nonmarketable securities”).  Marketable securities are publicly traded companies and are measured using unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.  Nonmarketable securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting are measured at cost, less any impairment and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer (“measurement alternative”).

Cumulative impairments and downward fair value adjustments on measurement alternative investments were $14 million and cumulative upward fair value adjustments were $69 million as of June 30, 2020.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements
The Company classifies its fair value measurements of financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy (the “Valuation Hierarchy”).  Financial instruments are categorized for fair value measurement purposes as recurring or non-recurring in nature.  There were no transfers made among the three levels in the Valuation Hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020.

1 The Company’s U.S. government securities are classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.  The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale municipal securities, non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities and asset-backed securities are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices, benchmark yields and issuer spreads for similar assets in active markets and are therefore included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy.2 The Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate derivative asset and liability contracts have been classified within Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair value is based on observable inputs such as broker quotes relating to foreign exchange and interest rates for similar derivative instruments.  See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for further details. 3 The Company’s Marketable securities are publicly held and classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.4 The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan where assets are invested primarily in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is restricted for payments to participants of the plan.  The Company has elected to use the fair value option for these mutual funds, which are measured using quoted prices of identical instruments in active markets and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
5 The deferred compensation liabilities are measured at fair value based on the quoted prices of identical instruments to the investment vehicles selected by the participants.  These are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial Instruments - Non-Recurring Measurements
Nonmarketable Securities
The Company’s Nonmarketable securities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods after initial recognition under the equity method or measurement alternative method.  Nonmarketable securities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value that require management’s judgment.  The Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value of its Nonmarketable securities when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.  See Note 6 (Investments) for further details.

Debt
The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on quoted market prices.  These debt securities are classified as Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as they are not traded in active markets.  At June 30, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of total long-term debt was $12.5 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively.  At December 31, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt was $8.5 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively.
Other Financial Instruments
Certain other financial instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost or amortized cost basis, which approximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature.  These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, settlement due from customers, restricted security deposits held for customers, accounts payable, settlement due to customers and other accrued liabilities.

1 During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the depreciation of the British pound and Brazilian real, partially offset by the appreciation of the euro.  During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the depreciation of the euro and British pound. 2 The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.  Changes in the value of the debt are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the net investment hedge was driven by the appreciation of the euro. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the net investment hedge was driven by the depreciation of the euro. See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.3 In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company entered into treasury rate locks which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.  In the first quarter of 2020, in connection with the issuance of the 2020 USD Notes, these contracts were settled and the Company recorded a loss of $175 million, or $150 million net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  As of June 30, 2020, the cumulative loss will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2020 USD Notes.  During the six months ended June 30, 2020, reclassifications to interest expense were not material.  See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.
4 During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities, reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to investment income, were not material.  See Note 6 (Investments) for additional information.

Note 13. Share-Based Payments
During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company granted the following awards under the Mastercard Incorporated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of June 5, 2012 (the “LTIP”).  The LTIP is a stockholder-approved plan that permits the grant of various types of equity awards to employees.

The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options and calculated the expected life and the expected volatility based on historical Mastercard information.  The expected life of stock options granted in 2020 was estimated to be six years, while the expected volatility was determined to be 19.3%.  Stock options generally vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company’s Class A common stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents.  For awards granted on or after March 1, 2020, shares underlying the RSUs will generally vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant.  For awards issued prior to March 1, 2020, shares underlying the RSUs will generally vest three years from the date of grant.

The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to determine the grant-date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted.  Shares underlying the PSUs will vest after three years from the date of grant.  For all PSUs granted on or after March 1, 2019, shares issuable upon vesting are subject to a mandatory one-year deferral period, during which vested PSUs are eligible for dividend equivalents. Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures over the shorter of the vesting period or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire under the LTIP.  The Company uses the straight-line method of attribution over the requisite service period for expensing equity awards.

Note 14. Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 16.0% and 15.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, versus 18.7% and 17.2%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2019.  The lower effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, versus the comparable periods in 2019, were primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings.The Company is subject to tax in the United States, Belgium, Singapore, the United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions, as well as state and local jurisdictions.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted after considering facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation.  Within the next twelve months, the Company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur.  While such a change may be significant, it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statutes of limitation expire.  The Company has effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2011.  With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to state and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit was $389 million and $203 million, respectively.  These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate.  The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased primarily due to a prior year tax issue resulting from a refund claim filed in the second quarter of 2020.

Note 15. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
Mastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business.  Some of these proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages.  Accordingly, except as discussed below, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and therefore, Mastercard has not established reserves for any of these proceedings.  When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, Mastercard records a liability and discloses the amount of the liability if it is material.  When a material loss contingency is only reasonably possible, Mastercard does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made.  Unless otherwise stated below with respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of the following reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of monetary damages or the amounts are unsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, (5) the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants or potential defendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel legal issues presented.  Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below, Mastercard does not believe that the outcome of any individual existing legal or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or overall business.  However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to any proceedings discussed below could result in fines or payments by Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its business practices.  In addition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the filing of civil damage claims and possibly result in significant damage awards.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Mastercard’s results of operations, financial condition and overall business.
Interchange Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
Mastercard’s interchange fees and other practices are subject to regulatory, legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions, including the proceedings described below.  When taken as a whole, the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s prospects for future growth and its overall results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  United States.  In June 2005, the first of a series of complaints were filed on behalf of merchants (the majority of the complaints were styled as class actions, although a few complaints were filed on behalf of individual merchant plaintiffs) against Mastercard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions.  Taken together, the claims in the complaints were generally brought under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit monopolization and attempts or conspiracies to monopolize a particular industry, and some of these complaints contain unfair competition law claims under state law.  The complaints allege, among other things, that Mastercard, Visa, and certain financial institutions conspired to set the price of interchange fees, enacted point of sale acceptance rules (including the no surcharge rule) in violation of antitrust laws and engaged in unlawful tying and bundling of certain products and services.  The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in MDL No. 1720.  The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint that seeks treble damages.

ITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In July 2006, the group of purported merchant class plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint alleging that Mastercard’s initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock in May 2006 (the “IPO”) and certain purported agreements entered into between Mastercard and financial institutions in connection with the IPO: (1) violate U.S. antitrust laws and (2) constituted a fraudulent conveyance because the financial institutions allegedly attempted to release, without adequate consideration, Mastercard’s right to assess them for Mastercard’s litigation liabilities.  The class plaintiffs sought treble damages and injunctive relief including, but not limited to, an order reversing and unwinding the IPO. In February 2011, Mastercard and Mastercard International entered into each of: (1) an omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement with Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions; and (2) a Mastercard settlement and judgment sharing agreement with a number of financial institutions.  The agreements provide for the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which Mastercard, the Visa parties and the financial institutions may incur, jointly and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of one or all of the cases in the merchant litigations.  Among a number of scenarios addressed by the agreements, in the event of a global settlement involving the Visa parties, the financial institutions and Mastercard, Mastercard would pay 12% of the monetary portion of the settlement.  In the event of a settlement involving only Mastercard and the financial institutions with respect to their issuance of Mastercard cards, Mastercard would pay 36% of the monetary portion of such settlement. In October 2012, the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement with respect to the merchant class litigation (including with respect to the claims related to the IPO) and the defendants separately entered into a settlement agreement with the individual merchant plaintiffs.  The settlements included cash payments that were apportioned among the defendants pursuant to the omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement described above.  Mastercard also agreed to provide class members with a short-term reduction in default credit interchange rates and to modify certain of its business practices, including its “no surcharge” rule.  The court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2013, and objectors to the settlement appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  In June 2016, the court of appeals vacated the class action certification, reversed the settlement approval and sent the case back to the district court for further proceedings.  The court of appeals’ ruling was based primarily on whether the merchants were adequately represented by counsel in the settlement.  As a result of the appellate court ruling, the district court divided the merchants’ claims into two separate classes - monetary damages claims (the “Damages Class”) and claims seeking changes to business practices (the “Rules Relief Class”).  The court appointed separate counsel for each class.In September 2018, the parties to the Damages Class litigation entered into a class settlement agreement to resolve the Damages Class claims.  Mastercard increased its reserve by $237 million during 2018 to reflect both its expected financial obligation under the Damages Class settlement agreement and the filed and anticipated opt-out merchant cases.  The time period during which Damages Class members were permitted to opt out of the class settlement agreement ended in July 2019 with merchants representing slightly more than 25% of the Damages Class interchange volume choosing to opt out of the settlement.  The district court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2019.  The district court’s settlement approval order has been appealed.  Mastercard has commenced settlement negotiations with a number of the opt-out merchants and has reached settlements and/or agreements in principle to settle a number of these claims.  The Damages Class settlement agreement does not relate to the Rules Relief Class claims.  Separate settlement negotiations with the Rules Relief Class are ongoing.  As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Mastercard had accrued a liability of $831 million and $914 million, respectively, as a reserve for both the Damages Class litigation and the opt-out merchant cases.  As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Mastercard had $587 million and $584 million, respectively, in a qualified cash settlement fund related to the Damages Class litigation and classified as restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheet.The reserve as of June 30, 2020 for both the Damages Class litigation and the opt-out merchants represents Mastercard’s best estimate of its probable liabilities in these matters.  The portion of the accrued liability relating to both the opt-out merchants and the Damages Class litigation settlement does not represent an estimate of a loss, if any, if the matters were litigated to a final outcome.  Mastercard cannot estimate the potential liability if that were to occur.  Canada.  In December 2010, a proposed class action complaint was commenced against Mastercard in Quebec on behalf of Canadian merchants.  The suit essentially repeated the allegations and arguments of a previously filed application by the Canadian Competition Bureau to the Canadian Competition Tribunal (dismissed in Mastercard’s favor) concerning certain Mastercard rules related to point-of-sale acceptance, including the “honor all cards” and “no surcharge” rules.  The Quebec suit sought compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts, as well as injunctive relief.  In the first half of 2011, additional purported class action lawsuits were commenced in British Columbia and Ontario against Mastercard, Visa and a number of large Canadian financial institutions.  The British Columbia suit sought compensatory damages in unspecified amounts, and the Ontario suit sought compensatory damages of $5 billion on the basis of alleged conspiracy and various alleged breaches of the Canadian Competition Act.  Additional purported class action complaints were commenced in Saskatchewan and Alberta with claims that largely mirror those in the other suits.  In June 2017, Mastercard entered into a class settlement agreement to resolve all of the Canadian class action litigation.  The settlement, which requires Mastercard to make a cash payment and modify its “no surcharge” rule, has received court approval in each Canadian province.  Objectors to the settlement have sought to appeal the approval orders.  Certain appellate courts have rejected the objectors’ appeals, while outstanding appeals remain in a few provinces.Europe.  Since May 2012, a number of United Kingdom (“U.K.”) retailers filed claims or threatened litigation against Mastercard seeking damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct with respect to Mastercard’s cross-border interchange fees and its U.K. and Ireland domestic interchange

fees (the “U.K. Merchant claimants”).  In addition, Mastercard, has faced similar filed or threatened litigation by merchants with respect to interchange rates in other countries in Europe (the “Pan-European Merchant claimants”).  In aggregate, the alleged damages claims from the U.K. and Pan-European Merchant claimants were in the amount of approximately £3 billion (approximately $4 billion as of June 30, 2020).  Mastercard has resolved over £2 billion (approximately $3 billion as of June 30, 2020) of these damages claims through settlement or judgment.  In January 2017, Mastercard received a liability judgment in its favor on all significant matters in a separate action brought by ten of the U.K. Merchant claimants.  Three of the U.K. Merchant claimants appealed the judgment, and these appeals were combined with Mastercard’s appeal of a 2016 judgment in favor of one U.K. merchant.  In July 2018, the U.K. appellate court heard the appeals of the four merchant claimants and ruled against both Mastercard and Visa on two of the three legal issues being considered.  The parties appealed the rulings to the U.K. Supreme Court.  In June 2020, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled against Mastercard and Visa with respect to one of the liability issues being considered by the Court related to U.K. domestic interchange fees.  Additionally, the U.K Supreme Court set out the legal standard that should be applied by lower trial courts with respect to determining whether interchange was exemptible under applicable law, and provided guidance to lower courts with regard to the legal standard that should be applied in assessing merchants’ damages claims.  The U.K. Supreme Court sent one of the four merchant cases back to the trial court for a determination of liability and damages issues and sent the remaining three merchant cases back to the trial court for a determination of damages issues only.  Mastercard expects to participate in a case management conference with the four merchant claimants during the second half of 2020, with the trials in these matters likely to be scheduled in 2021.  Mastercard continues to litigate with the remaining U.K. and Pan-European Merchant claimants and it has submitted statements of defense disputing liability and damages claims.  The majority of these merchant claims generally had been stayed pending the decision of the U.K. Supreme Court, and have therefore not progressed with either liability or damages discovery.  Mastercard incurred charges of $22 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 to reflect both the estimated attorneys’ fees incurred by the four merchant claimants in the U.K. Supreme Court appeal, as well as agreements in principle to settle with a number of Pan-European merchants.  In September 2016, a proposed collective action was filed in the United Kingdom on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages for intra-EEA and domestic U.K. interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by merchants between 1992 and 2008.  The complaint, which seeks to leverage the European Commission’s 2007 decision on intra-EEA interchange fees, claims damages in an amount that exceeds £14 billion (approximately $17 billion as of June 30, 2020).  In July 2017, the trial court denied the plaintiffs’ application for the case to proceed as a collective action.  In April 2019, the U.K. appellate court granted the plaintiffs’ appeal of the trial court’s decision and sent the case back to the trial court for a re-hearing on the plaintiffs’ collective action application.  Mastercard was granted permission to appeal the appellate court ruling to the U.K. Supreme Court, which heard oral argument on that appeal in May 2020.
ATM Non-Discrimination Rule Surcharge Complaints
In October 2011, a trade association of independent Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) operators and 13 independent ATM operators filed a complaint styled as a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against both Mastercard and Visa (the “ATM Operators Complaint”).  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of non-bank operators of ATM terminals that operate in the United States with the discretion to determine the price of the ATM access fee for the terminals they operate.  Plaintiffs allege that Mastercard and Visa have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by imposing rules that require ATM operators to charge non-discriminatory ATM surcharges for transactions processed over Mastercard’s and Visa’s respective networks that are not greater than the surcharge for transactions over other networks accepted at the same ATM.  Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.  Subsequently, multiple related complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging both federal antitrust and multiple state unfair competition, consumer protection and common law claims against Mastercard and Visa on behalf of putative classes of users of ATM services (the “ATM Consumer Complaints”).  The claims in these actions largely mirror the allegations made in the ATM Operators Complaint, although these complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services who pay allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank and non-bank ATM operators as a result of the defendants’ ATM rules.  Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. In January 2012, the plaintiffs in the ATM Operators Complaint and the ATM Consumer Complaints filed amended class action complaints that largely mirror their prior complaints.  In February 2013, the district court granted Mastercard’s motion to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s order in August 2015 and sent the case back for further proceedings.  In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed their motions for class certification in which the plaintiffs, in aggregate, allege over $1 billion in damages against all of the defendants.  Mastercard intends to vigorously defend against both the plaintiffs’ liability and damages claims and has opposed class certification.  Mastercard expects briefing on class certification to be completed in the second half of 2020.
U.S. Liability Shift Litigation
In March 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that  Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the “Network Defendants”), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks (the “Bank Defendants”) engaged in a conspiracy to shift fraud liability for card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in compliance with the standards for EMV chip cards in the United States (the “EMV Liability Shift”), in violation of the Sherman Act and California law.  Plaintiffs allege damages equal to the value of all chargebacks for which class members became liable as a result of the EMV Liability Shift on October 1, 2015.  The plaintiffs seek treble

damages, attorney’s fees and costs and an injunction against future violations of governing law, and the defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.  In September 2016, the court denied the Network Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants.  In May 2017, the court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. merchant class interchange litigation described above.  The plaintiffs have filed a renewed motion for class certification, following the district court’s denial of their initial motion.
Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action
Mastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action pending in Florida.  The plaintiffs are individuals and businesses who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them advertising a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank (“FAB”).  The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax.  Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed).  In June 2018, the court granted Mastercard’s motion to stay the proceedings until the Federal Communications Commission makes a decision on the application of the TCPA to online fax services.  In December 2019, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received via e-mail.  As a result of the ruling, the stay of the litigation was lifted in January 2020.  The parties have completed briefing plaintiff’s motion for class certification.
U.S. Federal Trade Commission Investigation
In June 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition (“FTC”) informed Mastercard that it has initiated a formal investigation into compliance with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  In particular, the investigation focuses on Mastercard’s compliance with the debit routing provisions of the Durbin Amendment.  The FTC has issued a subpoena and Mastercard is cooperating with it in the investigation.

Note 16. Settlement and Other Risk Management
Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between its customers (“settlement risk”).  Settlement exposure is the settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement.  While the term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited, the duration of settlement exposure is short term and typically limited to a few days.  Gross settlement exposure is estimated using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period end multiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure.  The Company has global risk management policies and procedures, which include risk standards, to provide a framework for managing the Company’s settlement risk and exposure.  In the event of a failed customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company’s rules to recover potential losses.  Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer failures.As part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that are not in compliance with the Company’s risk standards to post collateral, such as cash, letters of credit, or guarantees.  This requirement is based on a review of the individual risk circumstances for each customer.  Mastercard monitors its credit risk portfolio on a regular basis and the adequacy of collateral on hand.  Additionally, from time to time, the Company reviews its risk management methodology and standards and revises the estimated settlement exposure as necessary.
The Company’s estimated settlement exposure was as follows:
June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019  (in millions)Gross settlement exposure $42,398 $55,800Collateral held for settlement exposure (3,589) (4,772)Net uncollateralized settlement exposure $38,809 $51,028
Mastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other counterparties indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third parties to perform duties.  This includes guarantees of Mastercard-branded travelers cheques issued, but not yet cashed of $362 million and $367 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of which $285 million and $290 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, is mitigated by collateral arrangements.  In addition, the Company enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company.  Certain indemnifications do not provide a stated maximum exposure.  As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.  Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of contractual arrangements have not been material.

Note 17. Derivative and Hedging Instruments
The Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate exposures as part of its overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results.  A primary objective of the Company’s risk management strategies is to reduce the financial impact that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates principally through the use of both foreign exchange derivative contracts (Derivatives) and foreign currency denominated debt (Net Investment Hedge).  In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances (Cash Flow Hedges).
Foreign Exchange Risk
Derivatives
The Company enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are valued based on currencies other than the functional currency of the entity.  The Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations.  The objective of these activities is to reduce the Company’s exposure to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies.
The Company’s derivative contracts are summarized below:
June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019  Notional Estimated FairValue Notional Estimated FairValue  (in millions)Commitments to purchase foreign currency $705 $20 $185 $3Commitments to sell foreign currency 1,249 15 1,506 (25)Options to sell foreign currency — — 21 2Balance sheet location        Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1   49   12Other current liabilities 1   (14)   (32)
1 The derivative contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, which contain various netting and setoff provisions.
The amount of gain (loss) recognized on the consolidated statement of operations for the contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency is summarized below:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2020 2019 2020 2019  (in millions)Foreign exchange derivative contracts        General and administrative $(24) $(15) $83 $(20)
The fair value of the foreign exchange derivative contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive (or pay), on a pre-tax basis, to terminate the contracts.  The terms of the foreign exchange derivative contracts are generally less than 18 months.  The Company had no deferred gains or losses related to foreign exchange contracts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as these contracts were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting.The Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject to both market and counterparty credit risk.  Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other related variables.  Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms.  To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into derivative contracts with a diversified group of selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties.

Net Investment Hedge
The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates, with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  In 2015, the Company designated its €1.65 billion euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge for a portion of its net investment in European operations.  As of June 30, 2020, the Company had a net foreign currency pre-tax loss of $93 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with hedging activity.
Interest Rate Risk
Cash Flow Hedges
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company entered into treasury rate locks for a total notional amount of $1 billion, which were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  These contracts were entered into to hedge a portion of the Company’s interest rate exposure attributable to changes in the treasury rates related to the forecasted debt issuance during 2020.  The maximum length of time over which the Company had hedged its exposure was 30 years.  In connection with the issuance of the 2020 USD Notes, these contracts were settled and the Company paid $175 million.  As of June 30, 2020, a cumulative loss of $135 million net of tax was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with these contracts and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2020 USD Notes.  As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax net unrealized gain of $14 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with these contracts. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, reclassifications to interest expense were not material.  The Company estimates that $6 million, pre-tax, of the deferred loss on cash flow derivative contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at June 30, 2020 will be reclassified into interest expense on the statement of operations within the next 12 months.

COVID-19
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe.  This outbreak has resulted in the widespread reduction of business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners.  We are monitoring the effects of the pandemic and related actions taken by governments as they relate to travel restrictions, social distancing measures, re-opening of businesses, and the continued impact of these actions on consumer and commercial behavior.  The pandemic has had significant negative effects on the global economy.  The duration of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy is uncertain and may continue to be volatile. The COVID-19 outbreak has affected our 2020 performance to date, during which we have seen unfavorable trends compared to historical periods.  The impact of this outbreak started in the first quarter of 2020 as we experienced declines in our key metrics, primarily due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders implemented by governments in many regions and countries across the globe.  Early in the second quarter of 2020 switched transactions and cross-border volume growth rates started to stabilize around new lower activity levels as a result of compliance with social distancing and mobility limitations.  Subsequently switched transactions trends have progressively improved from the lower levels, in part due to relaxation of social distancing measures globally and the impact of fiscal stimulus in the United States.  Cross-border volume trends continued to be significantly impacted by the decline in travel, with modest improvements as the quarter progressed.  Additionally, gross domestic volumes declined during the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the year ago periods in 2019 for the reasons mentioned above. The full extent to which the pandemic, and measures taken in response, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.Financial Results OverviewThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported:

Non-GAAP Financial Information
Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts.  Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”).  Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:
Gains and Losses on Equity Investments
•In the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 we recorded net gains of $75 million ($67 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share), and net losses of $99 million ($80 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.•In the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net gains of $143 million ($111 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share), and  $148 million ($116 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.
Special Items
Litigation provisions
•In the second quarter of 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $22 million ($17 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to estimated attorneys’ fees and litigation settlements with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.•In the first quarter of 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $6 million ($5 million after tax, and an immaterial impact per diluted share) related to litigation settlements with U.K. merchants.
Tax act
•In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a $30 million tax benefit ($0.03 per diluted share) related to a reduction to the 2017 one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings resulting from final transition tax regulations issued in 2019.See Note 6 (Investments), Note 14 (Income Taxes) and Note 15 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion.  We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results.  The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting

Key Metrics
In addition to the financial measures described above in “Financial Results Overview”, we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions.  We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  Gross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)1 measures dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands during the period.  Dollar volume represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period.  Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported.  These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.Cross-border Volume2 measures cross-border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs. Switched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard.  We define transactions switched as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.  Operating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems.  All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers.2 Normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods.  Carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where the company does not clear and settle are processed.

Foreign Currency
Currency Impact (Translational and Transactional)
Our primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian real and the British pound.  Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.Our operating results can also be impacted by transactional currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”) and gross euro volume (“GEV”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives.  In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  As a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies.  For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar.  The currency transactional impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis decreased 14% and 4%, respectively, while GDV on a local currency basis decreased 10% and 1%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2019.  Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency.The translational and transactional impact of currency (“Currency impact”) has been identified in our drivers of change impact tables and has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  See “Financial Results - Revenue and Operating Expenses” for our drivers of change impact tables and “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments.
Foreign Exchange Activity
We incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts (“Foreign Exchange Activity”).  The impact of Foreign Exchange Activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see “Non-GAAP Financial Information”) and is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.  We manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and transactional currency exposure through our foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.  Since we do not designate foreign exchange derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives immediately in current period earnings, with the related hedged item being recognized as the exposures materialize.
Risk of Currency Devaluation
We are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries.  In addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into U.S. dollars.  While these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.

Primary drivers of net revenue, versus the comparable periods in 2019, were as follows:For the three months ended June 30, 2020, net revenue decreased 19%, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis reflecting impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and includes 1 percentage point of growth from our acquisitions.  Gross revenue decreased 16%, or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by decreased volumes, primarily cross-border volumes, offset by an increase in our value-added products and services.  Rebates and incentives decreased 10%, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, due to decreased volumes partially offset by new and renewed deals.  For the six months ended June 30, 2020, net revenue decreased 8%, or 6% on a currency-neutral basis reflecting impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak primarily in the second quarter of 2020, and includes 1 percentage point of growth from our acquisitions.  Gross revenue decreased 4%, or 2% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by decreased dollar volume activity, primarily cross-border volumes, partially offset by an increase in our value-added products and services and transactions growth.  Rebates and incentives increased 6%, or 9% on a currency-neutral basis, due to new and renewed deals partially offset by decreased volumes.

General and Administrative
For the three months ended June 30, 2020, general and administrative expenses were flat, or increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2019.  Current year results include growth of 4 percentage points from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the 3 percentage point decrease in expenses was primarily due to reduced spend on travel and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in personnel to support our continued investment in our strategic initiatives.For the six months ended June 30, 2020, general and administrative expenses increased 5%, or 6% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2019.  Current year results include growth of 5 percentage points from acquisitions and an increase in personnel to support our continued investment in our strategic initiatives. These increases are partially offset by reduced spend on travel and professional fees and a 2 percentage point benefit, primarily from foreign exchange derivative contracts.The components of general and administrative expenses were as follows:

See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion.
Advertising and Marketing
Advertising and marketing expenses decreased 59% and 41%, or 58% and 40% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, versus the comparable periods in 2019, primarily due to lower advertising and sponsorship spend in response to COVID-19.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 19% and 21%, or 20% and 22% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, versus the comparable periods in 2019, due to  higher depreciation from capital investments and the impact of acquisitions, which contributed 6 and 9 percentage points of growth, respectively.

Provision for Litigation
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded $22 million and $28 million, respectively related to various litigation settlements and legal costs.  There were no litigation charges in the comparable period in 2019.  See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” in this section and Note 15 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion.

Other Income (Expense)
For the three months ended June 30, 2020, other income (expense) was unfavorable, versus the comparable period in 2019, primarily due to lower net gains in the current period related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities, as well as increased interest expense related to our recent debt issuances.For the six months ended June 30, 2020, other income (expense) was unfavorable, versus the comparable period in 2019, primarily due to net losses in the current period versus net gains in prior period related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities, as well as increased interest expense related to our recent debt issuances.The components of our other income (expense) were as follows:

Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 16.0% and 15.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, versus 18.7% and 17.2%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2019.  The adjusted effective income tax rates were 16.3% and 15.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, versus 18.5% and 17.7%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2019.  The effective income tax rates, both as reported and as adjusted, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were lower versus the comparable periods in 2019, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us:

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in billions)Cash, cash equivalents and investments 1$11.5 $7.7Unused line of credit6.0 6.0

This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations.Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers.  Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses.  The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  See Note 16 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 for a description of these guarantees.  Our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7 (Business Environment) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Note 15 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 and Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Report.

Cash Flow
The table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:
Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$3,317 $2,848Net cash used in investing activities(626) (554)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,691 (3,160)
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $469 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, versus the comparable period in 2019, primarily due to higher collections of accounts receivable in the current period and a decrease in accrued litigation payments, partially offset by lower net income adjusted for non-cash items.Net cash used in investing activities increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020, versus the comparable period in 2019, primarily due to lower net proceeds from investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, partially offset by higher prior year acquisitions.During the six months ended June 30, 2020 we had net cash provided by financing activities versus the comparable period in 2019 when we had net use of cash for financing activities.  This change was primarily due to lower repurchases of our Class A common stock and higher net debt proceeds in the current period.
Debt and Credit Availability
In March 2020, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due March 2027, $1.5 billion principal amount of notes due March 2030 and $1.5 billion principal amount notes due March 2050.  Our total debt outstanding was $12.5 billion and $8.5 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, with the earliest maturity of $650 million of principal occurring in November 2021.As of June 30, 2020, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires in November 2024. Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. See Note 10 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion on our debt and Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.
Dividends
We have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend.  The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs. Aggregate payments for quarterly dividends totaled $804 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. On December 4, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share paid on February 7, 2020 to holders of record on January 9, 2020 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  The aggregate amount of this dividend was $403 million.On February 4, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on May 8, 2020 to holders of record on April 9, 2020 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

Share Repurchases
Repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock.  In December 2019 and 2018, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to $8.0 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of our Class A common stock under each plan.  The program approved in 2019 became effective in January 2020 after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2018.   The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.The following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations  and repurchase activity of our Class A common stock through June 30, 2020, under the plans approved in 2019 and 2018:

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in factors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates is limited.  Management monitors risk exposures on an ongoing basis and establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.Foreign currency exposures are managed through our risk management activities, which is discussed further in Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments).Foreign Exchange RiskWe enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  We may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations.  The objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro.  The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately $56 million and $144 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, related to the hedging program.  We are also subject to foreign exchange risk as part of our daily settlement activities.  To manage this risk, we enter into foreign exchange contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position.  This risk is typically limited to a few days between the timing of when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with our customers.Interest Rate RiskOur available-for-sale debt investments include fixed and variable rate securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.  Our policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure.  A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investments at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Item 4. Controls and procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Mastercard's internal control over financial reporting.

The following supplements the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (our “2019 Form 10-K”).  The following risk factor disclosure should be read in conjunction with the risk factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K.
The extent to which the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak and measures taken in response to it impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty.  The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns.  These measures have not only negatively impacted consumer spending and business spending, they have also adversely impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers and business partners.  These measures may remain in place for a significant period of time and they are likely to continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.  There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.  Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.  We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole.  However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.Risks related to consumers and businesses lowering or changing spending, which impact domestic and cross-border spend, are described in our risk factor titled “Global economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors-Global Economic and Political Environment” in our 2019 Form 10-K.  For a full discussion of our additional risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of our 2019 Form 10-K.

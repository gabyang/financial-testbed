Notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.
Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.  Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as equity method or measurement alternative method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.  The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date in which the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).The balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.  The consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and as of March 31, 2021 are unaudited, and in the opinion of management, include all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for interim periods.  The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  Reference should be made to the Mastercard’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.

Note 2. Acquisitions
On March 5, 2021, Mastercard acquired a majority of the Corporate Services business of Nets Denmark A/S for €3.0 billion (approximately $3.6 billion as of the date of acquisition) in cash consideration based on a €2.85 billion enterprise value, adjusted for cash and net working capital at closing.  The business acquired is primarily comprised of clearing and instant payment services and e-billing solutions.In relation to this acquisition, the Company’s preliminary estimate of net assets acquired has been recorded and primarily relates to intangible assets, including goodwill of $2.1 billion, of which $0.8 billion is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes.  The goodwill arising from the acquisition is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise through geographic, product and customer expansion, the underlying technology and workforce acquired.  Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the valuation techniques Mastercard utilizes to fair value the respective components of business combinations.

The Company’s corporate and municipal available-for-sale investment securities held at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 primarily carried a credit rating of A- or better.  Corporate securities are comprised of commercial paper and corporate bonds.  Municipal securities are comprised of state tax-exempt bonds and are diversified across states and sectors.  Government and agency securities include U.S. government bonds, U.S. government sponsored agency bonds and foreign government bonds which are denominated in the national currency of the issuing country.  Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The maturity distribution based on the contractual terms of the Company’s investment securities at March 31, 2021 was as follows:
Available-For-Sale Amortized CostFair Value (in millions)Due within 1 year$180 $180 Due after 1 year through 5 years190 191 Total$370 $371
Investment income on the consolidated statement of operations primarily consists of interest income generated from cash, cash equivalents, time deposits, and realized gains and losses on the Company’s investment securities.  The realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.
Held-to-Maturity Securities
The Company classifies time deposits with maturities greater than three months but less than one year as held-to-maturity.  Time deposits are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet and are intended to be held until maturity.  The cost of these securities approximates fair value.
Equity Investments
Included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet are equity investments with readily determinable fair values (“Marketable securities”) and equity investments without readily determinable fair values (“Nonmarketable securities”).  Marketable securities are publicly traded companies and are measured using unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.  Nonmarketable securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting are measured at cost, less any impairment and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer (“measurement alternative”).

ITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1The Company’s U.S. government securities are classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.  The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale municipal securities, non-U.S. government and agency securities and corporate securities are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices, benchmark yields and issuer spreads for similar assets in active markets and are therefore included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy.2The Company’s foreign exchange derivative asset and liability contracts have been classified within Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair value is based on observable inputs such as broker quotes relating to foreign exchange for similar derivative instruments.  See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for further details. 3The Company’s Marketable securities are publicly held and classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.4The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan where assets are invested primarily in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is restricted for payments to participants of the plan.  The Company has elected to use the fair value option for these mutual funds, which are measured using quoted prices of identical instruments in active markets and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
5The deferred compensation liabilities are measured at fair value based on the quoted prices of identical instruments to the investment vehicles selected by the participants.  These are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial Instruments - Non-Recurring Measurements
Nonmarketable Securities
The Company’s Nonmarketable securities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods after initial recognition under the equity method or measurement alternative method.  Nonmarketable securities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value that require management’s judgment.  The Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value of its Nonmarketable securities when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.  See Note 6 (Investments) for further details.
Debt
The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on market quotes.

1.During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related for foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the depreciation of the euro, British pound and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. 2.During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the decreases in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the net investment hedges were driven by the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information. 3.Beginning in 2021, certain foreign exchange derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.  Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings.  See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.4.In 2019, the Company entered into treasury rate locks which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.  In the first quarter of 2020, in connection with the issuance of the 2020 USD Notes, these contracts were settled for a loss of $175 million, or $136 million net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The cumulative loss will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2020 USD Notes.  See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.

Note 13. Share-Based Payments
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company granted the following awards under the Mastercard Incorporated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of June 5, 2012 (the “LTIP”).  The LTIP is a stockholder-approved plan that permits the grant of various types of equity awards to employees.

estimated to be six years, while the expected volatility was determined to be 26.1%.  Stock options generally vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company’s Class A common stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents.  The shares underlying the RSUs will generally vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant. The Company used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to determine the grant-date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted.  Shares underlying the PSUs will vest after three years from the date of grant and are subject to a mandatory one-year deferral period, during which vested PSUs are eligible for dividend equivalents. Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures over the shorter of the vesting period or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire under the LTIP.  The Company uses the straight-line method of attribution over the requisite service period for expensing equity awards.

Note 14. Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 16.5% and 14.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The higher effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021, versus the comparable period in 2020, was primarily due to lower discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments.The Company is subject to tax in the United States, Belgium, Singapore, the United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions, as well as state and local jurisdictions.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted after considering facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation.  Within the next twelve months, the Company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur.  While such a change may be significant, it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statutes of limitation expire.  The Company has effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2011.  With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to state and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.

Note 15. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
Mastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business.  Some of these proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages.  Accordingly, except as discussed below, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and therefore, Mastercard has not established reserves for any of these proceedings.  When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, Mastercard records a liability and discloses the amount of the liability if it is material.  When a material loss contingency is only reasonably possible, Mastercard does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made.  Unless otherwise stated below with respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of the following reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of monetary damages or the amounts are unsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, (5) the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants or potential defendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel legal issues presented.  Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below, Mastercard does not believe that the outcome of any individual existing legal or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or overall business.  However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to any proceedings discussed below could result in fines or payments by Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its business practices.  In addition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the filing of civil damage claims and possibly result in significant damage awards.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Mastercard’s results of operations, financial condition and overall business.
Interchange Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
Mastercard’s interchange fees and other practices are subject to regulatory, legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions, including the proceedings described below.  When taken as a whole, the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s prospects for future growth and its overall results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  United States.  In June 2005, the first of a series of complaints were filed on behalf of merchants (the majority of the complaints were styled as class actions, although a few complaints were filed on behalf of individual merchant plaintiffs) against Mastercard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions.  Taken together, the claims in the complaints were generally brought under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit monopolization and attempts or conspiracies to monopolize a particular industry, and some of these complaints contain unfair competition law claims under state law.  The complaints
22     MASTERCARD MARCH 31, 2021 FORM 10-Q


PART I
ITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
allege, among other things, that Mastercard, Visa, and certain financial institutions conspired to set the price of interchange fees, enacted point of sale acceptance rules (including the no surcharge rule) in violation of antitrust laws and engaged in unlawful tying and bundling of certain products and services, resulting in merchants paying excessive costs for the acceptance of Mastercard and Visa credit and debit cards.  The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in MDL No. 1720.  The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint that seeks treble damages. In July 2006, the group of purported merchant class plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint alleging that Mastercard’s initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock in May 2006 (the “IPO”) and certain purported agreements entered into between Mastercard and financial institutions in connection with the IPO: (1) violate U.S. antitrust laws and (2) constituted a fraudulent conveyance because the financial institutions allegedly attempted to release, without adequate consideration, Mastercard’s right to assess them for Mastercard’s litigation liabilities.  The class plaintiffs sought treble damages and injunctive relief including, but not limited to, an order reversing and unwinding the IPO. In February 2011, Mastercard and Mastercard International entered into each of: (1) an omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement with Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions; and (2) a Mastercard settlement and judgment sharing agreement with a number of financial institutions.  The agreements provide for the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which Mastercard, the Visa parties and the financial institutions may incur, jointly and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of one or all of the merchant litigation cases.  Among a number of scenarios addressed by the agreements, in the event of a global settlement involving the Visa parties, the financial institutions and Mastercard, Mastercard would pay 12% of the monetary portion of the settlement.  In the event of a settlement involving only Mastercard and the financial institutions with respect to their issuance of Mastercard cards, Mastercard would pay 36% of the monetary portion of such settlement. In October 2012, the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement with respect to the merchant class litigation (including with respect to the claims related to the IPO) and the defendants separately entered into a settlement agreement with the individual merchant plaintiffs.  The settlements included cash payments that were apportioned among the defendants pursuant to the omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement described above.  Mastercard also agreed to provide class members with a short-term reduction in default credit interchange rates and to modify certain of its business practices, including its “no surcharge” rule.  The court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2013, and objectors to the settlement appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  In June 2016, the court of appeals vacated the class action certification, reversed the settlement approval and sent the case back to the district court for further proceedings.  The court of appeals’ ruling was based primarily on whether the merchants were adequately represented by counsel in the settlement.  As a result of the appellate court ruling, the district court divided the merchants’ claims into two separate classes - monetary damages claims (the “Damages Class”) and claims seeking changes to business practices (the “Rules Relief Class”).  The court appointed separate counsel for each class.In September 2018, the parties to the Damages Class litigation entered into a class settlement agreement to resolve the Damages Class claims.  The time period during which Damages Class members were permitted to opt out of the class settlement agreement ended in July 2019 with merchants representing slightly more than 25% of the Damages Class interchange volume choosing to opt out of the settlement.  The district court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2019.  The district court’s settlement approval order has been appealed.  Mastercard has commenced settlement negotiations with a number of the opt-out merchants and has reached settlements and/or agreements in principle to settle a number of these claims.  The Damages Class settlement agreement does not relate to the Rules Relief Class claims.  Separate settlement negotiations with the Rules Relief Class are ongoing.  In December 2020, the Rules Relief Class filed a motion for class certification.  Briefing on summary judgment motions in the Rules Relief Class and opt-out merchant cases was completed in December 2020.As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Mastercard had accrued a liability of $783 million as a reserve for both the Damages Class litigation and the opt-out merchant cases.  As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Mastercard had $586 million in a qualified cash settlement fund related to the Damages Class litigation and classified as restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheet.  The reserve as of March 31, 2021 for both the Damages Class litigation and the opt-out merchants represents Mastercard’s best estimate of its probable liabilities in these matters.  The portion of the accrued liability relating to both the opt-out merchants and the Damages Class litigation settlement does not represent an estimate of a loss, if any, if the matters were litigated to a final outcome.  Mastercard cannot estimate the potential liability if that were to occur.  Canada.  In December 2010, a proposed class action complaint was commenced against Mastercard in Quebec on behalf of Canadian merchants.  The suit essentially repeated the allegations and arguments of a previously filed application by the Canadian Competition Bureau to the Canadian Competition Tribunal (dismissed in Mastercard’s favor) concerning certain Mastercard rules related to point-of-sale acceptance, including the “honor all cards” and “no surcharge” rules.  The Quebec suit sought compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts, as well as injunctive relief.  In the first half of 2011, additional purported class action lawsuits were commenced in British Columbia and Ontario against Mastercard, Visa and a number of large Canadian financial institutions.  The British Columbia suit sought compensatory damages in unspecified amounts, and the Ontario suit sought compensatory damages of $5 billion on the basis of alleged conspiracy and various alleged breaches of the Canadian Competition Act.  Additional purported class action complaints were commenced in Saskatchewan and Alberta with claims that largely mirror those in the other suits.  In June 2017, Mastercard entered into a

class settlement agreement to resolve all of the Canadian class action litigation.  The settlement, which required Mastercard to make a cash payment and modify its “no surcharge” rule, received court approval in each Canadian province.  All appeals by objectors to the settlement have either been rejected by the Supreme Court or abandoned, and the settlement is now final. Europe.  Since May 2012, a number of United Kingdom (“U.K.”) merchants filed claims or threatened litigation against Mastercard seeking damages for excessive costs paid for acceptance of Mastercard credit and debit cards arising out of alleged anti-competitive conduct with respect to, among other things, Mastercard’s cross-border interchange fees and its U.K. and Ireland domestic interchange fees (the “U.K. Merchant claimants”).  In addition, Mastercard, has faced similar filed or threatened litigation by merchants with respect to interchange rates in other countries in Europe (the “Pan-European Merchant claimants”).  In aggregate, the alleged damages claims from the U.K. and Pan-European Merchant claimants were in the amount of approximately £3 billion (approximately $5 billion as of March 31, 2021).  Mastercard has resolved over £2 billion (approximately $3 billion as of March 31, 2021) of these damages claims through settlement or judgment.  In January 2017, Mastercard received a liability judgment in its favor on all significant matters in a separate action brought by ten of the U.K. Merchant claimants.  Three of the U.K. Merchant claimants appealed the judgment, and these appeals were combined with Mastercard’s appeal of a 2016 judgment in favor of one U.K. merchant.  In July 2018, the U.K. appellate court heard the appeals of the four merchant and ruled against both Mastercard and Visa on two of the three legal issues being considered.  The parties appealed the rulings to the U.K. Supreme Court.  In June 2020, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled against Mastercard and Visa with respect to one of the liability issues being considered by the Court related to U.K. domestic interchange fees.  Additionally, the U.K Supreme Court set out the legal standard that should be applied by lower trial courts with respect to determining whether interchange was exemptible under applicable law, and provided guidance to lower courts with regard to the legal standard that should be applied in assessing merchants’ damages claims.  The U.K. Supreme Court sent one of the four merchant cases back to the trial court for a determination of liability and damages issues and sent the remaining three merchant cases back to the trial court for a determination of damages issues only.  A hearing in one of these merchant cases on liability and damages issues is expected to be scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021, while a trial on damages for the other three merchant claims is not expected to occur until 2023.Mastercard continues to litigate with the remaining U.K. and Pan-European Merchant claimants and it has submitted statements of defense disputing liability and damages claims.  The majority of these merchant claims generally had been stayed pending the decision of the U.K. Supreme Court, and a number of those matters are now progressing with motion practice and discovery.  In one of the actions involving multiple merchant plaintiff claims, the court has scheduled for May 2021 argument related to the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on certain liability issues.  Mastercard incurred charges of $22 million during the second quarter of 2020 to reflect both the estimated attorneys’ fees incurred by the four merchant claimants in the U.K. Supreme Court appeal, as well as settlements with a number of Pan-European merchants.  In September 2016, a proposed collective action was filed in the United Kingdom on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages for intra-EEA and domestic U.K. interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by merchants between 1992 and 2008.  The complaint, which seeks to leverage the European Commission’s 2007 decision on intra-EEA interchange fees, claims damages in an amount that exceeds £14 billion (approximately $19 billion as of March 31, 2021).  In July 2017, the trial court denied the plaintiffs’ application for the case to proceed as a collective action.  In April 2019, the U.K. appellate court granted the plaintiffs’ appeal of the trial court’s decision and sent the case back to the trial court for a re-hearing on the plaintiffs’ collective action application.  In December 2020, the U.K. Supreme Court rejected Mastercard’s appeal of this  ruling.  In March 2021, the trial court held a re-hearing on the plaintiffs’ collective action application.
ATM Non-Discrimination Rule Surcharge Complaints
In October 2011, a trade association of independent Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) operators and 13 independent ATM operators filed a complaint styled as a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against both Mastercard and Visa (the “ATM Operators Complaint”).  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of non-bank operators of ATM terminals that operate in the United States with the discretion to determine the price of the ATM access fee for the terminals they operate.  Plaintiffs allege that Mastercard and Visa have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by imposing rules that require ATM operators to charge non-discriminatory ATM surcharges for transactions processed over Mastercard’s and Visa’s respective networks that are not greater than the surcharge for transactions over other networks accepted at the same ATM.  Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.  Subsequently, multiple related complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging both federal antitrust and multiple state unfair competition, consumer protection and common law claims against Mastercard and Visa on behalf of putative classes of users of ATM services (the “ATM Consumer Complaints”).  The claims in these actions largely mirror the allegations made in the ATM Operators Complaint, although these complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services who pay allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank and non-bank ATM operators as a result of the defendants’ ATM rules.  Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.

In January 2012, the plaintiffs in the ATM Operators Complaint and the ATM Consumer Complaints filed amended class action complaints that largely mirror their prior complaints.  In February 2013, the district court granted Mastercard’s motion to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s order in August 2015 and sent the case back for further proceedings.  In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed their motions for class certification in which the plaintiffs, in aggregate, allege over $1 billion in damages against all of the defendants.  Mastercard intends to vigorously defend against both the plaintiffs’ liability and damages claims and has opposed class certification.  Briefing on class certification is complete.
U.S. Liability Shift Litigation
In March 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that  Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the “Network Defendants”), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks (the “Bank Defendants”) engaged in a conspiracy to shift fraud liability for card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in compliance with the standards for EMV chip cards in the United States (the “EMV Liability Shift”), in violation of the Sherman Act and California law.  Plaintiffs allege damages equal to the value of all chargebacks for which class members became liable as a result of the EMV Liability Shift on October 1, 2015.  The plaintiffs seek treble damages, attorney’s fees and costs and an injunction against future violations of governing law, and the defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.  In September 2016, the district court denied the Network Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants.  In May 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. merchant class interchange litigation described above.  In August 2020, the district court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification.  In January 2021, the Network Defendants’ request for permission to appeal the district court’s certification decision to the appellate court was denied.  The case is proceeding with substantive expert discovery.  The plaintiffs’ have submitted expert reports that allege aggregate damages in excess of $1 billion against the four Network Defendants.  The Network Defendants have submitted expert reports rebutting both liability and damages.
Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action
Mastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action pending in Florida.  The plaintiffs are individuals and businesses who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them advertising a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank (“FAB”).  The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax.  Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed).  In June 2018, the district court granted Mastercard’s motion to stay the proceedings until the Federal Communications Commission makes a decision on the application of the TCPA to online fax services.  In December 2019, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received via e-mail.  As a result of the ruling, the stay of the litigation was lifted in January 2020.  In January 2021, the magistrate judge serving on the district court issued an opinion recommending that the district court judge deny plaintiffs’ class certification motion.  In light of an appellate court decision, issued subsequent to the magistrate’s recommendation, the district court judge has instructed the parties to re-brief the motion for class certification.
U.S. Federal Trade Commission Investigation
In June 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition (“FTC”) informed Mastercard that it has initiated a formal investigation into compliance with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  In particular, the investigation focuses on Mastercard’s compliance with the debit routing provisions of the Durbin Amendment.  The FTC has issued a subpoena and Mastercard is cooperating with it in the investigation.
U.K. Prepaid Cards Matter
In 2019, Mastercard was informed by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) that Mastercard was a target of its confidential investigation into alleged anti-competitive conduct by public sector prepaid card program managers in the U.K.  This matter focused exclusively on historic behavior.  In March 2021, the PSR announced the resolution and settlement of this investigation.  As part of the resolution, Mastercard has agreed to pay a maximum fine of £32 million.  This matter has no prospective impact on Mastercard’s on-going business.  In connection with this matter, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Mastercard recorded a litigation charge of $45 million.

Note 16. Settlement and Other Risk Management
Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between its customers (“settlement risk”).  Settlement exposure is the settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement.  While the term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited, the duration of settlement exposure is short term and typically limited to a few days.  Gross settlement exposure is estimated using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period end multiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure.  The Company has global risk management policies and procedures, which include risk standards, to provide a framework for managing the Company’s settlement risk and exposure.  In the event of a failed customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company’s rules to recover potential losses.  Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer failures.

ITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that are not in compliance with the Company’s risk standards to post collateral, such as cash, letters of credit, guarantees, or other risk mitigating arrangements.  This requirement is based on a review of the individual risk circumstances for each customer.  Mastercard monitors its credit risk portfolio on a regular basis and the adequacy of collateral on hand.  Additionally, from time to time, the Company reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of estimated settlement exposure are revised as necessary.
The Company’s estimated settlement exposure was as follows:
March 31,2021December 31,2020(in millions)Gross settlement exposure$52,265 $52,360 Collateral applied to settlement exposure(6,128)(6,021)Net uncollateralized settlement exposure$46,137 $46,339
Mastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other counterparties indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third parties to perform duties.  This includes guarantees of Mastercard-branded travelers cheques issued, but not yet cashed of $368 million and $370 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, of which $292 million and $294 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, is mitigated by collateral arrangements.  In addition, the Company enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company.  Certain indemnifications do not provide a stated maximum exposure.  As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.  Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of contractual arrangements have not been material.

Note 17. Derivative and Hedging Instruments
The Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate exposures as part of its overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results.  A primary objective of the Company’s risk management strategies is to reduce the financial impact that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates principally through the use of both foreign exchange derivative contracts and foreign currency denominated debt.  In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, which fluctuate based on currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The objective of these hedging activities is to reduce the effect of movement in foreign exchange rates for a portion of revenues and expenses forecasted to occur. As these contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings.In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances, and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship.  In 2019, the Company entered into treasury rate locks which are accounted for as cash flow hedges. In the first quarter of 2020, in connection with the issuance of the 2020 USD Notes, these contracts were settled at a loss of $136 million after tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  As of March 31, 2021, a cumulative loss of $132 million after tax, remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with these contracts and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2020 USD Notes.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates.  The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded as a currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Forward points are designated as an excluded component and recognized in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations over the hedge period.In 2015, the Company designated its €1.65 billion euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge for a portion of its net investment in its European operations.  As of March 31, 2021, the Company had a net foreign currency loss of $72 million after tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this hedging activity.

Non-designated Derivatives
The Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to serve as economic hedges, such as to offset possible changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations, without designating these derivative contracts as hedging instruments.  In addition, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk as part of its daily settlement activities.  This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with customers.  To manage this risk, the Company may enter into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position.  The objective of these activities is to reduce the Company’s exposure to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies.  Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

The Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject to both market and counterparty credit risk.  Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other related variables.  Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms.  The Company’s derivative contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, which contain various netting and setoff provisions.  To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into derivative contracts with a diversified group of selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties.

COVID-19
Since early 2020, the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe and has had significant negative effects on the global economy.  This outbreak has affected business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce.  We continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic and actions taken by governments as they relate to travel restrictions, social distancing measures and restrictions on business operations, as well as the continued impact of these actions on consumers and businesses.  While some of these measures have eased in certain jurisdictions, others have remained in place.  The extent to which current measures are removed or new measures are put in place will depend upon how the pandemic evolves, as well as the progress of the global administration of vaccines. The following table provides a summary of trends in our quarterly key metrics since early 2020 as compared to the respective year-ago periods to provide context of the effects of the pandemic:

Non-GAAP Financial Information
Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which primarily includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts.  Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”).  Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:
Gains and Losses on Equity Investments
•In the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net gains of $94 million ($87 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share) and net losses of $174 million ($146 million after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.
Special Items
Litigation provisions
•In the first quarter of 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $6 million ($5 million after tax, and an immaterial impact per diluted share) related to litigation settlements with U.K. merchants.See Note 6 (Investments) and Note 15 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion.  We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.
Currency-neutral Growth Rates
We present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results as well as removing the related impact of our designated foreign exchange derivative contracts related to our cash flow hedging activities.  The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our designated cash flow foreign exchange derivative contracts is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statement of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.  We believe the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.The translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our designated foreign exchange cash flow hedging activities (“Currency impact”) has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has been identified in our drivers of change impact tables.  See “Foreign Currency - Currency Impact” for further information on our currency impacts and “Financial Results - Revenue and Operating Expenses” for our drivers of change impact tables.Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Key Metrics
In addition to the financial measures described above in “Financial Results Overview”, we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions.  We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  Gross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)1 measures dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis.  GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period.  Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported.  These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.Cross-border Volume2 measures cross-border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Switched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard.  We define transactions switched as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.Operating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense.  Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.1    Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems.  All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers.2    Normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods.  Carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where the company does not clear and settle are processed.
Foreign Currency
Currency Impact
Our primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian real and the British pound.  Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.Our operating results are also impacted by transactional currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”) and gross euro volume (“GEV”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives.  In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  As a result, certain of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies.  For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar.  The currency transactional impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis.  For the three months ended March 31, 2021, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis and on a local currency basis increased 9% and 8%, respectively, versus the comparable period in 2020.  Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.Through December 31, 2020, our approach to manage our transactional currency exposure consisted of hedging a portion of anticipated revenues impacted by transactional currencies by entering into foreign exchange derivative contracts, and recording the related changes in fair value in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.  During the first quarter of 2021, we started to formally designate certain newly-executed foreign exchange derivative contracts, which meet the established accounting criteria, as cash flow hedges.  Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these designated contracts will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statement of operations  when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.
Foreign Exchange Activity
We incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement receivables and payables with our customers, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities.  The gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.  The impact of foreign exchange activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.  Our foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.
Risk of Currency Devaluation
We are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries.  In addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into U.S. dollars.  While these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.

Financial Results

Revenue
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, gross revenue increased 4%, or 3% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2020, which includes growth of 1% percentage points from acquisitions.  The remaining increase was primarily driven by growth in gross dollar volume activity, number of switched transactions and our value-added products and services, partially offset by a decrease in our cross-border volumes.Rebates and incentives increased 6%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, versus the comparable period in 2020, primarily due to new and renewed deals and increased volumes, partially offset by mix.  Net revenue increased 4%, or 2% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, versus the comparable period in 2020,  and includes 1 percentage point of growth from our acquisitions.

Advertising and Marketing
Advertising and marketing expenses decreased 22%, or 24% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, versus the comparable period in 2020, primarily due to lower advertising and sponsorship spend in response to COVID-19.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, depreciation and amortization expenses increased 13%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable period in 2020, which includes growth of 9 percentage points from acquisitions.
Provision for Litigation
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no litigation charges.  For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded $6 million in provisions for litigation settlements with U.K. merchants.  See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” in this section for further discussion.

Both the as reported and as adjusted effective income tax rates increased primarily due to lower discrete benefits related to share-based payments. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us:

This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations which include litigation provisions and credit and settlement exposure.Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers.  Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses.  The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  See Note 16 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 for a description of these guarantees.Our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.

Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $396 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, versus the comparable period in 2020, primarily due to timing of settlement with customers and higher customer incentives paid, partially offset by timing of estimated tax payments.Net cash used in investing activities increased $3,053 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, versus the comparable period in 2020, primarily due to higher current year acquisition of businesses.During the three months ended March 31, 2021 we had a net use of cash for financing activities, versus the comparable period in 2020, when we had net cash provided by financing activities. This change was primarily due to lower net debt proceeds in the current period and higher dividends paid.
Debt and Credit Availability
In March 2021, we issued $600 million principal amount of notes due March 2031 and $700 million principal amount of notes due March 2051 (collectively the “2021 USD Notes”).  Our total debt outstanding was $13.9 billion and $12.7 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, with the earliest maturity of $650 million of principal occurring in November 2021.  The proceeds of the 2021 USD Notes due March 2031 are to be used to fund eligible green and social projects, examples of which are described in the Use of Proceeds section of the Prospectus Supplement filed on March 4, 2021.  All other notes are to be used for general corporate purposes.  As of March 31, 2021, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires in November 2025.Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.See Note 10 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion on our debt and Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.
Dividends and Share Repurchases
We have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend.  The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.Aggregate payments for quarterly dividends totaled $439 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On December 8, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share paid on February 9, 2021 to holders of record on January 8, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  The aggregate amount of this dividend was $439 million.On February 8, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share payable on May 7, 2021 to holders of record on April 9, 2021 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $434 million.Repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock.  In December 2020 and 2019, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to $6.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, of our Class A common stock under each plan.  The program approved in 2020 will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019.  The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the

For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the potential impact of these pronouncements refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.

Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in factors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates is limited.  Management monitors risk exposures on an ongoing basis and establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.Foreign currency and interest rate exposures are managed through our risk management activities, which is discussed further in Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.Foreign Exchange RiskWe enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  We may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations.  The objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro.  The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies could result in a fair value loss of approximately $63 million and $58 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.We are also subject to foreign exchange risk as part of our daily settlement activities.  To manage this risk, we enter into short duration foreign exchange contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position.  This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with our customers.  The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies could result in a fair value loss of approximately $33 million and $23 million on our short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. respectively. We are further exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to translation of our foreign operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  To manage this risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries.  The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in a fair value loss of approximately $196 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge at March 31, 2021, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.  The Company did not have similar foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2020.Interest Rate RiskOur available-for-sale debt investments include fixed and variable rate securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.  Our policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure.  A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair value of our investments at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

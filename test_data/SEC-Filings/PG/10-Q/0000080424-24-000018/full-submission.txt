NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries ("the Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We have prepared these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Note that certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.

2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

3. Segment Information

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2023, were comprised of:
Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationIntangible assets with determinable lives$9,071 $(6,444)Intangible assets with indefinite lives19,675 — Total identifiable intangible assets$28,746 $(6,444)
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $84 and $79, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization expense was $171 and $159, respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we determined that the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value. The Russia business accounted for approximately 4% of Gillette net sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

The Procter & Gamble Company        9
We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

5. Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.
Net earnings per common share were calculated as follows:

The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented.The fair value of long-term debt was $25.6 billion and $26.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($3.4 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Disclosures about Financial Instruments
The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, are as follows:
Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)December 31, 2023June 30, 2023December 31, 2023June 30, 2023December 31, 2023June 30, 2023DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSInterest rate contracts$3,098 $4,044 $— $— $(317)$(445)DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSForeign currency interest rate contracts$12,267 $11,005 $5 $26 $(347)$(631)TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$15,365 $15,049 $5 $26 $(664)$(1,076)DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTSForeign currency contracts$4,321 $3,489 $37 $7 $(7)$(42)TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$19,686 $18,538 $42 $33 $(671)$(1,118)
The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $2.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $10.8 billion and $11.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively.  Derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. Derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $653 and $1,088 as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.

9. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

12        The Procter & Gamble Company
We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 30–40 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $15, including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

10. Supplier Finance Programs
The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2023, and $5.8 billion as of June 30, 2022.

11. Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting.  In December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax, consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred charges of $89 including $48 in Costs of products sold and $39 in SG&A. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred charges of $181 including $109 in Costs of products sold and $68 in SG&A.

Separation Costs
Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods.
Asset-Related Costs
Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation for manufacturing consolidations. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.
Other Costs
Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. Such charges include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures
The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of Results – Six Months Ended December 31, 2023•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2023•Segment Results – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2023•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAPThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.

OVERVIEW
P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport The Procter & Gamble Company        15duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Limited Market Portfolio Restructuring
In December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax, consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. Although the timing of the completion of this restructuring program has yet to be determined, the Company currently anticipates that these restructuring charges will be recognized in the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and 2025. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs will be reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


16        The Procter & Gamble Company
Intangible Asset Impairment
During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company’s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. For a more detailed discussion of the Gillette impairment, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2023
The following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2023, versus the six months ended December 31, 2022:•Net sales increased 5% to $43.3 billion versus the prior year period. Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits in Grooming and low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, also increased 5%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits in Health Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digits in Beauty.•Net earnings were $8.0 billion, an increase of $127 million, or 2%, versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.0 billion after taxes related to the Gillette intangible asset. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $8.0 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 1%, versus the prior year period. •Diluted EPS increased 2% to $3.23 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the Gillette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring, increased 16% to $3.66.•Operating cash flow was $10.0 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $8.7 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge, was 96%.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised more than 20% of our net sales in the fiscal year 2023. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. We are also exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments including unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, military conflicts, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. These risks can reduce our net sales or erode our operating margins and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to energy shortages, natural disasters, labor or freight constraints could also lead to increased costs. New or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could also result in increased costs due to higher material costs and investments in facilities and equipment. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have significant translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three years, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar has resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, net earnings and cash flows and could do so in the future. Certain countries that are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Russia and Turkey. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency The Procter & Gamble Company        17impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy." The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites and accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Ukraine business accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. The Russia business accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and ultimate resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.

Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $21.4 billion. The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 4%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1%. Unit volume and mix were unchanged. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% while organic volume declined by 1%.The following table summarizes key drivers of the change in net sales by reportable segment:

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 520 basis points to 52.7% of net sales for the quarter. The increase in gross margin was due to:•240 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings,•200 basis points of lower commodity costs and•a 190 basis-point increase due to higher pricing.These impacts were partially offset by:•a 70 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,•20 basis points of product and packaging investments and•20 basis points of rounding and other impacts.The Procter & Gamble Company        19Total SG&A spending increased 8% to $5.5 billion versus the prior year period due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 130 basis points to 25.8% due to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales were unchanged as wage inflation, foreign exchange and other cost increases were offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $248 million for the quarter, an increase of $77 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Interest income was $133 million for the quarter, an increase of $67 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $177 million, which is an increase of $22 million versus the prior year period.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was 22.3%, compared to 18.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by 180 basis points due to the net impact of the prior year recognition of operating loss carryforwards and 180 basis points due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts.
Net Earnings
Operating income decreased $352 million, or 7%, to $4.4 billion for the quarter, due to the non-cash, before tax impairment charge to the Gillette intangible asset of $1.3 billion and an increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of net sales. This was partially offset by the increase in net sales, along with the increase in gross margin, all of which are discussed above. Net earnings decreased $466 million, or 12%, to $3.5 billion due to the decrease in operating income and an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $78 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $465 million, or 12%, to $3.5 billion for the quarter. Diluted EPS decreased 12% to $1.40 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings. Core EPS, which represents diluted EPS excluding charges for the Gillette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring, increased 16% to $1.84.

Global market share of the Home Care category increased 1.2 points.Net earnings increased 34% to $3.1 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 430 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by higher pricing, increased productivity savings and lower commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale effects of the net sales increase.

Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $49 million to $126 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased to a loss of $1.2 billion for the quarter due to the impairment of the Gillette intangible asset, increased interest expense and higher restructuring charges.For the six months ended December 31, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $158 million to $270 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased to a loss of $1.4 billion due to the impairment charge of the Gillette intangible asset, increased interest expense and higher restructuring charges.

LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
Operating cash flow was $10.0 billion fiscal year to date, an increase of $2.4 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, intangible asset impairment, and share-based compensation expense), generated $10.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $927 million of cash in the period primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable from sales growth, a reduction in salary related liabilities due to the excess of payment over accruals, and a reduction in postretirement benefit accruals resulting from the net periodic benefit credit and payments. This is partially offset by the impact of our supplier finance program (see Note 10, Supplier Finance Programs). Days sales outstanding and Days inventory on hand increased by three days.
Investing Activities
Investing activities used $2.2 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges.
Financing Activities
Financing activities used $8.1 billion of net cash fiscal year to date, mainly due to dividends to shareholders, treasury stock purchases, and a net debt decrease, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other. As of December 31, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $12.8 billion. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.

MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.The Procter & Gamble Company        27Organic sales growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:

Adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.
The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):
Six Months Ended December 31, 2023Operating Cash FlowCapital SpendingU.S. Tax Act PaymentsAdjusted Free Cash Flow$10,004 $(1,742)$422 $8,684
Adjusted free cash flow productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:•Incremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.•Intangible asset impairment: As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2023, a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

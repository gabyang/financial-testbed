4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows:
BeautyGroomingHealth CareFabric & Home CareBaby, Feminine & Family CareTotal CompanyGoodwill at June 30, 2022$13,296 $12,571 $7,589 $1,808 $4,436 $39,700 Acquisitions and divestitures404 — — — 34 438 Translation and other221 148 130 16 65 580 Goodwill at March 31, 2023$13,921 $12,719 $7,719 $1,824 $4,535 $40,718
Goodwill increased from June 30, 2022, primarily due to an acquisition in the Beauty segment, other minor brand acquisitions in the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment and currency translation.
Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2023, were comprised of:
Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationIntangible assets with determinable lives$9,170 $(6,335)Intangible assets with indefinite lives20,997 — Total identifiable intangible assets$30,167 $(6,335)
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, was $82 and $79, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization expense was $241 and $230, respectively.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31.Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. In connection with the Grooming operating segment integration as described further in Note 3, we concluded that the Shave Care and Appliances categories are one reporting unit (Grooming) for goodwill impairment testing. Based on our annual impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Grooming goodwill reporting unit, which is comprised entirely of acquired businesses, has a fair value cushion of over 30% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. As of March 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $14.1 billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value by up to 5%.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.
Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value+25 bps Discount Rate-25 bps Growth Rates-50 bps Royalty RateGillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(6)%(6)%(4)%

5. Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.
Net earnings per share were calculated as follows:

7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2023.The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented.Cash equivalents were $6.0 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $91 and $140 as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, including equity securities of $63 and $113 as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments measured at fair value are primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were $2 and $(4) during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were $10 and $(36) during the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These unrealized gains/(losses) are recognized in Other non-operating income, net. The fair value of long-term debt was $25.9 billion and $25.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($4.1 billion and $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Disclosures about Financial Instruments
The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, are as follows:

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $3.6 billion and $4.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $10.5 billion and $11.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is partially offset by the decrease in debt designated as a net investment hedge due to maturities. The net increase in the total amount of instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $1,131 and $219 as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.
Before tax gains on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows:

(1)    For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $64 and $18 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $179 and $50 for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.(2)    In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $(242) and $237 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $(406) and $804 for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The loss on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The loss on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A).

9. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40–50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $30, including interest and penalties.Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures
The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections:•Overview•Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023•Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAPThroughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) that include organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.
OVERVIEW
P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.
The table below lists our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, versus the nine months ended March 31, 2022:•Net sales increased by 1% to $61.5 billion versus the prior year period. Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, low single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Grooming. Net Sales in Beauty was unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, Grooming and Beauty.•Net earnings were $11.3 billion, a decrease of $389 million, or 3%, versus the prior year period due to a decrease in operating margin, partially offset by the increase in net sales.•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $11.3 billion, a decrease of $421 million, or 4%, versus the prior year period.•Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) decreased 1% to $4.53 due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. •Operating cash flow was $11.5 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $9.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, was 83%.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain very dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in Central and Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), the Middle East, certain Latin American markets and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation and labor costs, broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints, freight container and truck shortages and inflation have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary impacts or cost increases may also offset portions of the impacts, however such increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Historically, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar have resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations such as Argentina, Brazil, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and Turkey have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy". Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt and Pakistan. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites. We have approximately 400 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of March 31, 2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $200 million as of March 31, 2023. We have approximately 1,800 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2022, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of March 31, 2023. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2023
The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter increased by 4% to $20.1 billion. The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 10% and favorable mix of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 4% and a decrease in unit volume of 3%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Favorable mix was driven by a higher proportion of sales in North America (with higher than company-average selling prices) and a lower proportion of sales in Europe (with lower than company-average selling prices).Net Sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Grooming. On a regional basis, volume decreased double digits in Europe, decreased mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and IMEA, decreased low single digits in Greater China and increased mid-single digits in Latin America. Volume was unchanged in North America.

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 150 basis points to 48.2% of net sales for the quarter. The increase in gross margin was due to:•a 470 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and•210 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings.These impacts were partially offset by •270 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs,•a 140 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, •a 70 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,•20 basis points of increased transportation costs,•20 basis points of product and packaging investments and•a 10 basis-point decline from capacity start-up and other manufacturing costs.Total SG&A spending increased by 8% to $5.4 billion versus the prior year period due to increased marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 100 basis points to 27.0% due primarily to the increase in overhead costs and other operating costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings were mostly offset by the increase in marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due primarily to higher foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $222 million for the quarter, an increase of $113 million versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates and an increase in short-term debt in the current fiscal year. Interest income was $83 million for the quarter, an increase of $74 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $179 million, an increase of $32 million versus the prior year period, due to an increase in net non-operating benefits on postretirement benefit plans.
Income Taxes
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the effective tax rate increased 280 basis points versus the prior year period to 20.1% due to:•a 120 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 140 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 260 basis-point benefit in the prior year period) and•a 170 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings and cross-border tax impacts. These increases were partially offset by a 10 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 10 basis-point unfavorable impact in the current period versus a 20 basis-point unfavorable impact in the prior year period).
Net Earnings
Operating income increased $224 million, or 6%, to $4.2 billion for the quarter, due to the increase in net sales and the increase in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $57 million, or 2%, to $3.4 billion, as the increase in operating income was partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $309 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $42 million, or 1%, to $3.4 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.37 versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023

Net Sales
Net sales for the period increased by 1% to $61.5 billion. The increase in net sales was driven by higher pricing of 10% and a favorable mix of 1%, mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6% and a 4% decrease in unit volume. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Favorable mix is driven by a higher proportion of sales in North America (with higher than company-average selling prices) and decline in Europe (with lower than company-average selling prices).Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, increased low single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Grooming. Net sales were unchanged in Beauty. On a regional basis, volume decreased double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Greater China and low single digits in North America, Asia Pacific and IMEA. Volume increased low single digits in Latin America.

Operating Costs
Gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 47.7% of net sales for the period. The decrease in gross margin was due to: •390 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs,•a 140 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix due to the launch and growth of premium products (which have lower than Company-average gross margins) and the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, •a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,•30 basis points of increased transportation costs,•20 basis points of product and packaging investments and•10 basis points due to capacity start-up costs and other manufacturing impacts.These impacts were partially offset by •a 450 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and•130 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings.Total SG&A spending increased by 2% to $15.3 billion due to increased overhead costs and other operating costs, partially offset by decreased marketing spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 25.0% as the decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was more than offset by an increase in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and increased savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges and a prior period gain on the sale of real estate. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 50 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $516 million for the period, an increase of $192 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in short-term debt in the current period and higher interest rates. Interest income was $191 million for the period, an increase of $161 million versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $473 million, an increase of $49 million versus the prior year period due primarily to a prior period unrealized loss on equity investments.
Income Taxes
For the nine months ended March 31, 2023, the effective tax rate increased 140 basis points versus the prior year period to 19.6% due to:•a 130 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 90 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 220 basis-point benefit in the prior year period) and•a 10 basis-point increase from favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions in the prior year period.A favorable impact primarily due to the recognition of operating loss carryforwards is fully offset by unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings and cross-border tax impacts.
Net Earnings
Operating income decreased $243 million, or 2%, to $14.0 billion for the period as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings decreased $389 million, or 3%, to $11.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period due to the decrease in operating income and an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $1.1 billion on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $421 million, or 4%, to $11.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 1% to $4.53 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $42 million to $173 million due to a decrease in sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $257 million to a loss of $114 million for the quarter due to the decrease in net sales of incidental businesses, increased commodity costs tied to incidental businesses and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. For the fiscal year to date period, Corporate net sales improved by $96 million to $601 million, due to an increase in sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings declined by $603 million to a loss of $221 million, as the net sales growth of incidental businesses was more than offset by increased commodity costs tied to the incidental businesses, higher foreign exchange transactional charges and prior period gain on the sale of real estate.

Working capital and other impacts used $1.9 billion of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $301 million of cash, driven by sales growth. Days sales outstanding increased by one day. Total inventories increased, consuming $503 million of cash driven by increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency. Days on hand increased by four days. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities decreased, using $1.4 billion of cash, primarily driven by postretirement benefit payments, net periodic credit from other retiree benefits, and reduced raw and packaging material purchases to adjust supply chain activities to volume trends.

As of March 31, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $15.7 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.

RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and adjusted for transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted net earnings per share. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

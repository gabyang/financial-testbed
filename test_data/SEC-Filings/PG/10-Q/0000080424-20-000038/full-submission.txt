THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Basis of Presentation
These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.  However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.

2.  New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
On July 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)."  The new accounting standard requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet.  We elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis with no restatement of prior period amounts.  As allowed under the new accounting standard, we elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulting in an increase of approximately 1% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet as of July 1, 2019.  See Note 10 for further information.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."  The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety.  This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach.  It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  We will adopt the standard effective July 1, 2020.  The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."  The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform.  The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.  The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform.  These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022.  We are currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by the new standard.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.  Segment Information

Goodwill from current year acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflects opening balance sheet adjustments from the prior year acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 12), along with a minor Baby Care acquisition in the current year and adjustments from a prior year Beauty acquisition.
Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2020 were comprised of:
Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationIntangible assets with determinable lives$8,458  $(5,628) Intangible assets with indefinite lives21,004  —  Total identifiable intangible assets$29,462  $(5,628)
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships.  The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands.  The amortization expense of determinable lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was $87 and $98, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the amortization expense was $274 and $252, respectively.Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment.  The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform a second step (the step two testing) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill.  The step two testing of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination.  If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.  However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.  Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high.  The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019.  The underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets. As a result of the June 30, 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20% as of June 30, 2019.  Because the impairment testing for intangible assets is a one-step process, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date.  During our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on developments in the macroeconomic environment.  As a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5%.  The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate.  The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period.  The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates.  The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share.  As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.  The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure.  Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the
Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar.  Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.  While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.  As of March 31, 2020, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $12.4 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively.The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.  While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, a prolonged pandemic could impact the results of operations due to changes to assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which  may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital.   The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values.  The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

5.  Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method, on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.
Net earnings per share were as follows:
CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTSThree Months Ended March 31Nine Months Ended March 312020201920202019Net earnings$2,957  $2,776  $10,317  $9,203  Less:  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests40  31  90  65  Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted)2,917  2,745  10,227  9,138  Preferred dividends(64) (64) (193) (195) Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic)$2,853  $2,681  $10,034  $8,943  SHARES IN MILLIONSBasic weighted average common shares outstanding2,476.2  2,509.1  2,489.1  2,501.5  Add:  Effect of dilutive securitiesConversion of preferred shares (1)85.5  89.6  86.4  90.8  Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2)51.6  39.0  54.8  32.0  Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding2,613.3  2,637.7  2,630.3  2,624.3  NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3)Basic$1.15  $1.07  $4.03  $3.58  Diluted$1.12  $1.04  $3.89  $3.48
(1)Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.  Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035.(2)Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 7 million and 4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and approximately 3 million and 25 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares).(3)Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

6.  Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits
The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs:

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


7.  Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2020.The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.  The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.  Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2020.Other investments had a fair value of $50 and $169 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets.  During the nine months ended March 31, 2020, the Company sold all of its existing U.S. government securities and corporate bond securities.  Such securities were presented in Available-for-sale investment securities at June 30, 2019, and had fair values of $3,648 and $2,400, respectively.  The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Cash equivalents were $14,171 and $2,956 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments.The fair value of long-term debt was $28,602 and $25,378 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively.  This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($3,473 and $3,390 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively).  Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value.  All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Disclosures about Financial Instruments
The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 are as follows:

All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.  All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities.  The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation.  The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $7,217 and $7,860 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively.  In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.  The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $16,765 and $17,154 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively.  Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI).  All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

9.  Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses.  This program is expected to result in incremental targeted enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  For the three and nine month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $222 and $420, respectively. Of these charges incurred, approximately $198 and $331 were recorded in Cost of products sold and approximately $21 and $80 were recorded in SG&A, respectively.  The remainder of these charges were recorded in Other non-operating income, net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2020:

Separation Costs
Employee separation charges for the three and nine month period ended March 31, 2020 relate to severance packages for approximately 350 and 720 employees, respectively.  The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.
Asset-Related Costs
Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges.
Other Costs
Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization.Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting.  Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.  However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments:

10.  Leases
The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of a contract by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods.  Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease.  For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.  The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate.  The Company does not have any material financing lease or sublease activities.The Company incurred lease expense for operating leases of $82 and $255 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, respectively.  Total cash paid related to leases during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 was $60 and $205, respectively, including amounts expensed and amounts capitalized.  Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material.  The most significant assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles.  For purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined lease and non-lease components.The right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities were $42 and $70 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, respectively.
Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases is as follows:

11.  Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.  While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40–50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $50, including interest and penalties.Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019.


Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


12.  Merck Acquisition
On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the OTC healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction.  This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we completed the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation is based on the final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. The following table presents the allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of the acquisition:
Amounts in millionsNovember 30, 2018Current assets$421  Property, plant and equipment119  Intangible assets2,134  Goodwill2,083  Other non-current assets209  Total assets acquired$4,966  Current liabilities$232  Deferred income taxes763  Non-current liabilities94  Total liabilities acquired$1,089  Noncontrolling interest (1)$169  Net assets acquired$3,708
(1)Represents a 48% minority ownership interest in the Merck India company.
The acquisition resulted in $2.1 billion in goodwill, of which approximately $180 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  All of this goodwill was allocated to the Health Care reportable segment. The fair value of Merck OTC’s identifiable intangible assets is $2.1 billion. The allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows:
Amounts in millionsEstimated Fair ValueAvg RemainingUseful LifeIntangible assets with determinable lives   Brands$701  14   Patents and technology162  10   Customer relationships325  20   Total$1,188  15Intangible assets with indefinite lives   Brands946  Total intangible assets$2,134
The majority of the acquired intangible assets relate to brand intangibles.  Our assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion.  The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands.  The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to R&D and manufacturing know-how.  The customer relationships intangibles are related to Merck OTC’s relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors.

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled "Economic Conditions and Uncertainties" and the section titled "Risk Factors" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 •Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAPThroughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information.  References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items if applicable and is used to explain changes in organic sales.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2019:•Net sales increased 5% to $53.3 billion, driven by a double digit increase in Health Care, mid-single digits increases in Beauty and Fabric & Home Care and a low single digits increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, partially offset by a low single digits decrease in Grooming. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 6%, driven by high single digits increase in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits increases in Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digits increases in Grooming.•Unit volume increased 5% , with organic volume up 4%. Volume increased double digits in Health Care, mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Grooming volume was unchanged. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased high single digits in Health Care.•Net earnings were $10.3 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 12% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales, an increase in operating margin and a reduction in the current period income tax rate, partially offset by the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership.•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion or 12% versus the prior year period to $10.2 billion .•Diluted net earnings per share increased 12% to $3.89 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.•Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding incremental restructuring charges in both periods and the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, increased 16% to $10.4 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 16% to $3.96 due primarily to the increase in Core net earnings.•Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $10.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 101%.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions.  Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs.  Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange.  We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Greater China, Turkey and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits.Government Policies.  Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy." The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxing rights. Further, our earnings and sales may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey.  Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and potential future changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q.
COVID-19 Pandemic disclosures
The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and the use of our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges.  Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material net impact to our consolidated operating results in the current quarter. However, the pandemic has had offsetting impacts during the period.  For example, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 we experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories in certain markets (the health, hygiene and cleaning products, and primarily in North America and Europe) caused in part by changing consumer habits and pantry stocking, contributing to increases in net sales.  At the same time, we experienced declines in Greater China, Japan, and in certain channels, including travel retail, due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements, as well as in certain of our beauty and grooming products.  In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment.  It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits.  However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in markets such as Greater China and Japan, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand trends caused by future economic trends are unclear.  Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in net sales and resulting earnings during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic.  Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic.  Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products.Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain.  The Company has endeavored to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of our products. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we were able to broadly maintain our operations. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic.  However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations.  Because the pandemic has not materially impacted our operations or demand for our products, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term debt ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2020
The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 versus the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $17.2 billion including a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange.  Unit volume increased 6%. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume also increased 6%. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had no impact to net sales. Volume increased high single digits in Heath Care, Fabric & Home Care and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, and increased low single digits in Beauty. Grooming volume was unchanged. On a regional basis, volume increased double digits in North America and high single digits in Europe driven by innovation, increased demand and market growth, particularly in household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and Latin America. These increases were partially offset by a double digits volume decrease in Greater China due to market contraction driven by economic slowdown resulting from COVD-19 and a low single digits decrease in India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Organic sales increased 6% on a 6% increase in organic volume.

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 49.4% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: •170 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (150 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments),•100 basis points of lower commodity costs, and•40 basis points of positive pricing impactsThese benefits were partially offset by a 160 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments which have lower than company average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories), a 60 basis-point decline from higher restructuring costs and a 10 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $5.0 billion primarily due to increases in marketing spending and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 29.3% due to an increase in marketing spending and other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending were more than offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 50 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transaction charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $100 million for the quarter, a decrease of $31 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Interest income was $39 million for the quarter, a $13 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower average cash and investment securities balances and reduced U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $106 million, a decrease of $22 million due to higher costs on certain postretirement benefit plans in the current period.
Income Taxes
For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the effective tax rate increased 20 basis points versus the prior year period to 15.5%. A 290 basis-point increase from an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S. was partially offset by: •a 150 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure,•a 70 basis-point reduction from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (30 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 40 basis-point increase in the prior year period) and•a 40 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (280 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 240 basis-point reduction in the prior year period).
Net Earnings
Operating income increased $224 million, or 7% to $3.5 billion for the quarter, due to the net sales increase and the increase in gross margin, partially offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $181 million or 7% to $3 billion due to the increase in operating income. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $144 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $172 million or 6% to $2.9 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 8% to $1.12. Core net earnings per share increased 10% to $1.17. Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share, excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020
The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2019.

Net Sales
Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 increased 5% to $53.3 billion including a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 5%. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased 4%. Increased pricing had a 1% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven primarily by disproportionate organic growth of the Health Care segment and the Skin & Personal Care category, both of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased double digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume was unchanged in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased high single digits. On a regional basis volume grew mid-single digits in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America and grew low single digits in IMEA. Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in Latin America. Organic sales increased 6% on a 4% increase in organic volume.

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 50.6% of net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Gross margin benefited from: •130 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (110 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments),•50 basis points of positive pricing impacts, and•70 basis points of lower commodity costsThese benefits were partially offset by a 10 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 50 basis point net decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and other impacts.Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $14.7 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in marketing spending and to a lesser extent overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 27.6% due to a decrease in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, were more than offset by reinvestments in media and other marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, productivity savings and lower restructuring charges versus the base period, partially offset by inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points primarily due to gains from legal settlements, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange transaction charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $308 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of $90 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Interest income was $133 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of $35 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in cash and investment securities balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $323 million, a decrease of $362 million primarily due to the base period gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership.
Income Taxes
For the nine months ended March 31, 2020, the effective tax rate decreased 70 basis points versus the prior year period to 16.6% due to:•a 130 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure and•a 40 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 180 basis-point reduction in the current year versus a 140 basis-point reduction in the prior year).These reductions are partially offset by:•a 60 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and •a 30 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix of earnings.
Net Earnings
Operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 14% to $12.2 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $1.1 billion or 12% to $10.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period due to the increase in operating income and the lower tax rates as described above, partially offset by the base period gain on the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $234 million on net earnings for the fiscal year to date period, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion or 12% to $10.2 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share increased 12% to $3.89. Core net earnings per share increased 16% to $3.96. Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans and the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the base period.

Beauty
Three months ended March 31, 2020 compared with three months ended March 31, 2019
Beauty net sales decreased 1% to $3.0 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 1% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable product mix reduced net sales by 2% driven by the disproportionate decline of the super premium SKII brand, caused by the impacts of the COVD-19 pandemic related travel restrictions and economic downturns in Greater China and certain markets in Asia. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 1%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.2 points. The volume increase was driven by a double digit increase in Europe, a high single digit increase in Asia Pacific and a mid-single digit increase in North America, partially offset by a double digit decrease in Greater China (primarily due to reduced demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) and in IMEA.•Volume in Hair Care decreased low single digits. The volume decrease was driven by a high teens decline in Greater China (due to the aforementioned negative impacts of COVID-19), a double digit decline in IMEA and a mid-single digits decline in North America (both due to market declines in certain countries). This was partially offset by a double digit volume increase in Europe and high single digit increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged.•Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased high single digits, primarily driven by growth in personal care products. Volume grew double digits in North America, high single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific and mid-single digits in Greater China (all due to innovation, increased marketing spending and increased consumption and pantry loading due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased less than half a point.Net earnings decreased 21% to $436 million due to the decrease in net sales and a 360 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin.  The net earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and an increase in effective tax rates due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, due to the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SKII brand, partially offset by increased pricing. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the negative scale impacts of the net sales decrease and increased marketing spending.Beauty fiscal year to date net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Favorable product mix added 1% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Skin and Personal Care category, including the Olay Skin care brand, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%.  Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. Volume grew high single digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and low single digits in North America, Greater China and Latin America, partially offset by low single digit decrease in IMEA.•Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits. Increased volume was driven by high single digits growth in Europe, mid-single digits growth in Asia Pacific and low single digits growth in Latin America due to product innovation and market growth, partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Greater China (due to the aforementioned impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) and a low single digit decline in IMEA (due to market decline in certain countries). Volume in North America was unchanged. Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions, organic volume in North America decreased low single digits due to market decline. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged.•Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased high single digits. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume growth was driven by a double digit increase in Greater China and mid-single digits increases in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Volume growth was driven by innovation, increased marketing spending, market growth and to a lesser extent increased consumption and pantry loading in the most recent quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased less than half a point.Net earnings increased 4% to $2.2 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 10 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased marginally due to a reduction in gross margin, offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the lower relative growth of the SK-II brand and the disproportionate growth of large sizes) and other hurts related to new manufacturing startup costs, partially offset by increased pricing. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase.

Organic sales decreased 1%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.8 points. Mid-single digits volume increases in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, were offset by a mid-teens decline in Greater China primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and a mid-single digits decline in North America.•Shave Care volume was unchanged. Volume increased high single digits in Asia Pacific, increased mid-single digits in Latin America and increased low single digits in IMEA due to product innovation and increased distribution in certain markets. This was offset by a double digit decline in Greater China (due to the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic) and a mid-single digits decline in North America (due to limited distribution capacity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). Global market share of the Shave Care category increased slightly.•Volume in Appliances decreased low single digits. Volume declined more than 30% in Greater China and declined high single digits in Asia Pacific due to the aforementioned COVID-19 impacts and competitive activity. This was partially offset by a more than 20% volume increase in IMEA, a high single digits increase in North America and a low single digits increase in Europe due to innovation and increased marketing spending in certain markets. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than two points.Net earnings decreased 26% to $254 million due to the decrease in net sales and a 570 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin declined primarily due to an increase in effective tax rates due to the benefit in the base period from the favorable adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions. To a lesser extent the net earnings margin was impacted by a reduction in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razor products and Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the benefits of manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to the negative scale impacts of the net sales decline.

Global market share of the Shave Care category was unchanged.•Volume in Appliances decreased low single digits. A double digit decline in Asia Pacific and Greater China (due to market contraction, competitive activities and to a lesser extent the aforementioned impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic), was partially offset by mid-single digits volume increase in North America and low single digits increase in Europe due to innovation. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than a point.Net earnings decreased 4% to $1.0 billion due to the decrease in net sales and an 80 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to an increase in effective tax rates and to a lesser extent a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The increase in tax rates was due to the benefit in the base period from the favorable adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a favorable legal settlement in the current period and a reduction in overhead costs due to productivity savings. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razor products and Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the benefits of manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices.

Organic sales increased 9%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.8 points. The volume increase was led by double digit growth in Latin America and IMEA and high single digits growth in Europe and North America. This was partially offset by a mid-teens decline in Greater China due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic related economic slowdown.•Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits. The volume increase was driven by over 20% growth in IMEA, mid-teens growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in Europe and low single digits growth in North America all driven by innovation and market growth. This was partially offset by a mid-teens volume decline in Greater China due to the economic slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased less than a point.•Volume in Personal Health Care increased double digits versus the prior year period. The volume increase was driven by high teens growth in North America, mid-teens growth in Europe, high single digits growth in Latin America, and mid-single digits growth in IMEA, driven by innovation, increased marketing spending and increased consumption and pantry loading due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased a point.Net earnings increased 14% to $408 million, due to the increase in net sales and a 110 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of certain markets in IMEA with lower than segment average margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in overhead costs due to productivity savings.Health Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 13% to $7.0 billion on a 13% increase in unit volume. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic sales increased 8% and organic volume increased 7%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%.

Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate organic growth of the Personal Health Care category which has higher than segment average margins. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.6 points. The volume increase was led by over 30% growth in IMEA, high teens growth in Latin America, mid-teens growth in Europe, double digit growth in Asia Pacific and high single digits growth in North America, partially offset by mid-single digits decrease in Greater China. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased mid-teens in IMEA, increased high single digits in Latin America, increased mid-single digits in Europe and increased low single digits in Asia Pacific. •Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits. Increased volume was driven by over 20% growth in IMEA, double digits growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in Asia Pacific and North America and low single digits growth in Europe, all due to innovation and market growth. Excluding the impact of minor divestitures, volume in Europe grew mid-single digits.

Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales decreased $7 million to $116 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and decreased $62 million to $306 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings improved by $20 million in the quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits during the quarter that are not allocated to the segment, partially offset by higher restructuring charges, all of which have been described above. Fiscal year to date Corporate net earnings increased $26 million as tax benefits and lower interest expense in the current period were largely offset by the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership.
Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings
In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan is expected to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred $1.8 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, with an additional amount of $0.5 to $0.6 billion expected in fiscal 2020. This program is expected to result in additional targeted enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins.
Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.


LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
We generated $12.6 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and loss on sale of assets), generated $12.3 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts generated $333 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable decreased, generating $135 million of cash, primarily due to the timing of the quarter-end (which fell on a Tuesday versus Sunday in the prior year end, resulting in additional collection days in the current year).  Inventory increased, consuming $533 million of cash primarily to support business growth, including increased manufacturing to help build safety stocks to help manage through the COVID-19 pandemic and product initiatives. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $738 million of cash.  Taxes payable accounted for approximately $400 million of this amount, primarily due to an approximate $500 million increase related to the integration of Merck, which had no impact on operating cash flows, as there was an equal and offsetting release of a deferred tax liability that was initially created on the acquisition of Merck.  Extended payment terms to suppliers generated approximately $475 million of cash and all other accruals used approximately $140 million.  All other operating assets and liabilities used $58 million of cash.
Investing Activities
Investing activities generated $3.7 billion of cash fiscal year to date. Capital expenditures were $2.4 billion, or 4.5% of net sales. We received $6.2 billion of cash from sales and maturities of investment securities.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities used $5.0 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $7.4 billion for treasury stock purchases, $5.8 billion for dividends and $1.5 billion for debt repayments. Cash from the issuance of bonds and commercial paper generated $5.0 billion and $3.0 billion of cash, respectively, and the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of cash.As of March 31, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $5.8 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.Organic sales growth:  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.  This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.Adjusted free cash flow:  Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act).  Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.Adjusted free cash flow productivity:  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings.  Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.Core EPS:  Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring:  The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities.  Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax.  In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities.  In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan.  This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings.  The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.Gain on Dissolution of PGT Healthcare Partnership:  The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018.  The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business and resulted in the Company recognizing an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million.  We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.  These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters, and tax.


Item 1A.Risk Factors
We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially.
Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.
We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&A, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets.



Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business.
Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments.
Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit.
A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital.
Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results.
Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, or disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have interrupted product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results.
Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results.
Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.
We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results.



The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.
The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories, and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results.
A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.
We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.
If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.
We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.
Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the Company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and results. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.
An information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation.



As part of the Company’s regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. As part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the Company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this IT/OT risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed.We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:•ordering and managing materials from suppliers; •converting materials to finished products; •shipping products to customers; •marketing and selling products to consumers; •collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”); •summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; •managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;•hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;•collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; •complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; •providing data security; and •handling other processes necessary to manage our business.Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack.Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers’ databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. Such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. In addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers’ IT/OT databases or systems.Periodically, we also need to upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies. If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. Further, if the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results.





Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.
Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union ("Brexit") has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the U.K.'s future legal and economic framework and how the U.K. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results.
We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad.
Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or disposability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.
The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”). The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex.  The ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has used to calculate the impacts. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. An outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS") project is a new project undertaken by more than 130 member countries of the expanded OECD Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy." The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. As this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results.
We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.
As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our financial results have been, and in the future could also be, impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the integration of Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business acquired in fiscal 2019, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets.



Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change.
Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including the move to a new organizational structure in fiscal 2020, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. Our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.
We must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns.
Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These impacts include, but are not limited to:•Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity; if prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may adversely impact our results;•Inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, or other manufacturing and distribution capability; •Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or•Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results.Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Basis of Presentation
These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.  However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.

2.  New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
On July 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."  The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety.  This eliminated the second step of the previous impairment model that required companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach.  It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  The impact of the new standard will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."  The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform.  The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.  The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform.  These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022.  We are currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by the new standard.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.  Segment Information
Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care.

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.



Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2020 were comprised of:
Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationIntangible assets with determinable lives$8,571 $(5,849)Intangible assets with indefinite lives21,092 — Total identifiable intangible assets$29,663 $(5,849)
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships.  The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands.  The amortization expense of determinable lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $84 and $96, respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values.  We typically use an income method to estimate fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.  If the resulting fair value is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.  Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.  However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.  To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future.  Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high.  The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value.  As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019.  Also as previously disclosed, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value as of our most recent impairment testing dates.  Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate.  The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period.  The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates.  The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share.  As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.  The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure.  Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar.  Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.  While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.  The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.  While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk.  Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the pandemic’s impact on net sales will be largely eliminated in the second half of the fiscal year.  There continues to be an extreme
Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve and how governments and consumers will react.  Accordingly, there is a significant amount of risk related to this key assumption.  A more prolonged pandemic could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment.  Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which  may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products.  In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital.  As of September 30, 2020, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $12.7 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively.   The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values.  The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

5.  Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares during the period.  The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.
Net earnings per share were calculated as follows:

(1)Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.  Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035.(2)Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares).(3)Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

6.  Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.




7.  Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2020.The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.  The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.  Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the three months ended September 30, 2020.Other investments had a fair value of $66 and $67 as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets.  The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Cash equivalents were $12.2 billion and $14.6 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments.The fair value of long-term debt was $29.5 billion and $29.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.  This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($2.5 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020).  Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value.  All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Disclosures about Financial Instruments
The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020 are as follows:
Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)September 30, 2020June 30, 2020September 30, 2020June 30, 2020September 30, 2020June 30, 2020DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSInterest rate contracts$7,339 $7,114 $276 $269 $— $— DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSForeign currency interest rate contracts$8,089 $3,856 $21 $26 $(196)$(41)TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$15,428 $10,970 $297 $295 $(196)$(41)DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTSForeign currency contracts$5,944 $5,986 $40 $23 $(32)$(25)TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$21,372 $16,956 $337 $318 $(228)$(66)
The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation.  The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.  In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.  The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $12.5 billion and $16.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.  The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is largely offset by the decrease in the principal balance of debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, reflecting the Company’s decision to leverage favorable interest rates in the foreign currency swap market versus the short-term debt market.      All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.  All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI).  All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows:

(1)For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $14 and $19 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.  The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $(646) and $609 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.  These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense.  The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure.  These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A).

9.  Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses, which resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020. We expect fiscal 2021 restructuring charges to be more in line with our ongoing level of spending noted above. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. The following table presents restructuring activity for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The majority of the charges during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and the remaining reserve balance as of September 30, 2020 related to employee separations.

10.  Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.  While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40–50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $60, including interest and penalties.Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled "Economic Conditions and Uncertainties" and the section titled "Risk Factors" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.  The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 •Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAPThroughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information.  References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items if applicable and is used to explain changes in organic sales.


OVERVIEW

Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $4.1 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macro-economic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula and economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of a multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  In the past two fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Russia Turkey and the European Union have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and net earnings.  Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example,  any regulatory guidance issued as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act) and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy." The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Further, our sales, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey.  Further, our sales, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.
COVID-19 Pandemic Disclosures
The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges.  Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated sales, net earnings and cash flows. The pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts to our sales and net earnings during the quarter ended September 30, 2020.  We have experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories (fabric, home cleaning and hygiene products) primarily in North America and Europe, caused in part by changing consumer habits, pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to increases in sales, net earnings and cash flows.  At the same time, we experienced a decrease in sales due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain regions, including IMEA (India, Middle East and Africa), Asia Pacific and Latin America, in certain channels including travel retail and professional, and in certain of our beauty and grooming products. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits.  However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain markets in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear.  Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic.  Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic.  Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products.Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain.  The Company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. We have been able to broadly maintain our operations, but we have experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets in Asia Pacific and IMEA due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic.  However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations.  Because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations or demand for our products and resulting sales and net earnings, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020

Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter increased 9% to $19.3 billion on a 7% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care, Personal Care, Health Care and Appliances businesses all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales also increased 9% on a 7% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased mid-teens in Fabric & Home Care, increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Beauty, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-teens in North America driven by innovation, increased demand and retailer inventory rebuild, particularly in household cleaning, health care and personal hygiene products due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased high single digits in Greater China, increased mid-single digits in IMEA and Latin America and increased low single digits in Europe. These increases were partially offset by a low single digits volume decrease in Asia Pacific primarily due to the base period inventory build by retailers in Japan in advance of a VAT increase.

(1)Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.(2)Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 52.7% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: •120 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (100 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments),•70 basis points of lower commodity costs,•40 basis points of help from higher pricing,•30 basis points of help due to higher restructuring costs in the base period and•20 basis points of help from other impactsThese benefits were partially offset by a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and a 30 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.Total SG&A spending increased 2% to $4.9 billion primarily due to increases in marketing spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 160 basis points to 25.3% due to a reduction in marketing spending and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, partially offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 100 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales was unchanged. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 110 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $136 million for the quarter, an increase of $28 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in average debt balances. Interest income was $10 million for the quarter, a $48 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower average cash and investment securities balances and reduced U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $142 million, an increase of $39 million due to gains from minor brand divestitures and an increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans caused by annual actuarial assumption updates.
Income Taxes
For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate increased 200 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.7% due to:•a 120 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure and•a 140 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of current year earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S. These increases are partially offset by:•a 10 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (5 basis-point unfavorable impact in the current year versus a 15 basis-point unfavorable impact in the prior year period) and •a 50 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation (250 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 200 basis-point reduction in the prior year period).
Net Earnings
Operating income increased $991 million, or 23% to $5.3 billion for the quarter, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $691 million or 19% to $4.3 billion primarily due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $100 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $684 million or 19% to $4.3 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 20% to $1.63 versus the base period diluted net EPS and increased 19% versus the base period Core EPS which represents diluted net earnings per share excluding incremental restructuring charges in the base period related to our productivity and cost savings plans.

Beauty
Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019
Beauty net sales increased 7% to $3.8 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 7% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 7%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.4 points. •Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits, due to a mid-single digit increase in volumes and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by a double digits increase in Greater China, a high single digits increase in North America, a mid-single digits increase in Latin America and low single digits increases in Asia Pacific and IMEA due to innovation, increased demand following pandemic-related shutdowns and inventory restocking. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased slightly.•Skin and Personal Care net sales increased high single digits, due to a double digit increase in volumes, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and unfavorable mix impacts. Organic sales also increased high single digits. Volume grew more than 20% in Greater China, grew double digits in Asia Pacific and grew high single digits in North America driven by innovation and increased consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased slightly.Net earnings increased 12% to $976 million due to the increase in net sales and a 120 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a reduction in gross margin and an increase in tax rates due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, due to the relatively lower global growth of the super-premium SKII brand, partially offset by increased pricing. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and reduced marketing spending.
Grooming
Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019
Grooming net sales increased 5% to $1.6 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 5% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 1.8 points. •Shave Care net sales decreased low single digits as a low single digit increase in volume, was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of lower priced products in IMEA. Organic sales were unchanged. Volume increased more than 20% in IMEA and increased low single digits in North America and Latin America due to product innovation and increased distribution in certain markets. This was partially offset by mid-single digits decreases in Europe and Asia Pacific primarily due to pandemic-related consumption decline. Global market share of the Shave Care category decreased more than half a point.•Appliances net sales increased more than 40% primarily due to a volume increase of more than 30%. Organic sales increased more than 30%. Volume increased in all regions led by more than a 50% increase in North America, more than a 40% increase in Europe and a high-teens increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation and increased consumption of at-home grooming and styling products driven by the pandemic. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than a point.Net earnings increased 1% to $355 million due to the increase in net sales partially offset by a 90 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin declined primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of IMEA, which has lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, partially offset by a favorable legal settlement in the base period.



Health Care
Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019
Health Care net sales increased 11% to $2.5 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 9% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales for the quarter. Favorable mix increased net sales by 2% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and power brush products both of which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 12%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 1.4 points. •Oral Care net sales increased mid-teens due to a high single digit increase in volume, favorable mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of North America and premium power brush products, and increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased mid-teens. Volume grew in all regions, led by double digits growth in North America and IMEA and high single digits growth in Europe, Greater China and Latin America driven by innovation. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased less than a point.•Personal Health Care net sales increased high single digits versus the prior year period due to a high single digit increase in volume and increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by double digits growth in North America, Europe, IMEA and Latin America and high single digits growth in Asia Pacific, driven by innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased two points.Net earnings increased 31% to $525 million, due to the increase in net sales and a 310 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin, a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a gain on a minor brand divestiture in the current period. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in other operating expenses due to costs related to the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition in the base period.
Fabric & Home Care
Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019
Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 14% to $6.6 billion during the first fiscal quarter on an 10% increase in unit volume.  Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 4% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care category, which have higher than segment average prices. Pricing and foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales also increased 14%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 1.2 points. •Fabric Care net sales increased high single digits due to a high single digit increase in volume and positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region. Organic sales also increased high single digits. Increased volume was driven by high teens growth in North America, high single digits growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in Greater China and low single digits growth in Europe, all due to product innovation and consumption increases in certain markets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by a high single digits decline in Asia Pacific, primarily due to the base period increase in retailer inventories prior to a VAT increase in Japan. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point.•Home Care net sales increased more than 30%, primarily due to a volume increase of more than 20%, a positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased more than 30%. Volume increased in all regions led by more than 30% growth in North America, more than 20% growth in Europe, Latin America and IMEA and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific all due to consumption increases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, product innovation and to a lesser extent, retailer inventory restocking in the U.S. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point.Net earnings increased 31% to $1.3 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 270 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase.



Baby, Feminine & Family Care
Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019
Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 3% to $4.7 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 3% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Mix had no impact to net sales. Organic sales increased 4%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.4 points. •Net sales in Baby Care decreased mid-single digits due to a mid-single digit decrease in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales decreased low single digits. Volume decreased mid-teens in Latin America (due to market contraction), decreased double digits in Asia Pacific (due primarily to the base period increase in retailer inventories prior to a VAT increase in Japan) and IMEA (due to pandemic-related retailer inventory reductions and market contraction) and decreased high single digits in Greater China (primarily due to competitive activity and consumer pantry destocking). This was partially offset by mid-single digits growth in North America (due to consumption increase in certain products and pandemic-related retailer inventory restocking). Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased less than a point.•Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and premium products primarily in Greater China, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased over 20% in Asia Pacific due to a new launch in the adult incontinence category in Japan. Volume increased high single digits in North America (primarily due to pandemic-related trade inventory increases and innovation) and in IMEA (primarily due to market growth). This was partially offset by a mid-single digits decline in Greater China and a low single digits decline in Europe and Latin America primarily due to the COVID-19 related consumption declines. Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased more than half a point.•Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased double digits driven by a double digit increase in volumes and increased pricing driven by lower consumer promotions, partially offset by unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of larger pack sizes. Organic sales also increased double digits. The volume increase was driven by COVID-19 related consumption increase and to a lesser extent retailer inventory restocking. North America share of the Family Care category decreased a point.Net earnings increased 16% to $1.0 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 230 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin and a marginal decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased marginally due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase.
Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales decreased $2 million to $93 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Corporate net earnings improved by $3 million in the quarter as lower restructuring charges versus the base period and lower overheads spending were partially offset by higher interest expense, lower interest income and tax benefits in the base period, all of which have been described above.
Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings
In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. As part of this plan, which was largely completed by the end of fiscal 2020, the Company incurred $1.5 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of $250 to $500 million before tax. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins.



Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.


LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
We generated $4.7 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $570 million versus the prior year period.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $5.2 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $510 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $825 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Days sales outstanding also increased about two days driven by a higher relative amount of sales towards the end of the quarter. Inventory increased, consuming $137 million of cash primarily due to holiday seasonality builds in certain categories and to support business growth. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $442 million of cash, primarily due to an increase in trade-related payables and accruals (approximately $650 million to support business growth and to a lesser extent, extended payment terms to suppliers) and increased taxes payable caused by growth in earnings and the timing of estimated payments (approximately $440 million), partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals.
Investing Activities
Investing activities used $829 million of cash fiscal year to date primarily due to capital expenditures of $850 million.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities used $6.7 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $2.0 billion for treasury stock purchases, $2.0 billion for dividends and $3.6 billion related to the reduction of short-term debt due primarily to the maturity of commercial paper.  The exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $893 million of cash.As of September 30, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.0 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. Subsequent to September 30, 2020 the Company announced a plan to early retire approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding debt securities. The execution of the program is expected to be completed during the three months ended December 31, 2020 and the cash outlay would be funded through a combination of existing liquidity and potentially new debt financing. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.Organic sales growth:  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.  This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.Adjusted free cash flow:  Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act.  Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.Adjusted free cash flow productivity:  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings.  Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.Core EPS:  Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring:  The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities.  Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax.  Since 2012, the Company has had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges.  The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.  In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level. We do not view the above item to be part of our sustainable results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.  This item is also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

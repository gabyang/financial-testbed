THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  Basis of Presentation
These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the Form 8-K filed October 26, 2015 to update the Form 10-K to revise disclosures to reflect discontinued operations related to the pending sale of certain Beauty Brands businesses, which was announced by the Company on July 9, 2015.  For additional details on the transaction and discontinued operations, see Note 11.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.  However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.


2.  New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".  This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2018.  While we are currently assessing the impact of the new standard, we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity".  The guidance included new reporting and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.  For additional details on discontinued operations, see Note 11.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”.  The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2019.  We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”.  The standard amends several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2017.  We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

4.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows:
Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby, Feminine and Family Care Total CompanyGoodwill at June 30, 2015$12,704 $19,619 $5,876 $1,874 $4,549 $44,622Acquisitions and divestitures(2) — (2) — — (4)Translation and other48 (1) 6 (7) 15 61Goodwill at March 31, 2016$12,750 $19,618 $5,880 $1,867 $4,564 $44,679
On July 9, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to divest four product categories, initially comprised of 43 of its beauty brands ("Beauty Brands"), which will be merged with Coty, Inc.  The transaction includes the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color and cosmetics businesses and a majority of the fine fragrances business, along with select hair styling brands (see Note 11).  The Beauty Brands have historically been part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment (previously named Beauty, Hair and Personal Care).  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations.  As a result, the goodwill attributable to the Beauty Brands as of June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2016 is excluded from the preceding table and is reported as Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged Duracell, which the Company had infused with approximately $1.9 billion of additional cash, to repurchase all 52.5 million shares of P&G stock owned by BH (see Note 11).  Prior to the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $402 ($350 after-tax) during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, which reflected the value of BH's shares in P&G stock as of the date of the impairment charges. Goodwill increased from June 30, 2015 primarily due to currency translation.The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill.  The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination.  If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.  However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Electronic Hair Removal, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high.  While both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the Shave Care cushion, as well as the related indefinite-lived intangible assets, have been reduced to below 20% due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that began in recent years and continued subsequent to June 30, 2015.  As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 are comprised of:

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.



Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated AmortizationIntangible assets with determinable lives$7,525 $(4,606)Intangible assets with indefinite lives21,710 —Total identifiable intangible assets$29,235 $(4,606)
Due to the pending divestiture of the Beauty Brands, intangible assets specific to these businesses are reported as Assets held for sale (see Note 11).Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships.  The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands.  The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $98 and $113, respectively.  The amortization expense of intangible assets for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $301 and $348, respectively.


5.  Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits
The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.  The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs:
Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2016 2015 2016 2015Share-based compensation expense$79 $72 $220 $222Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1)85 105 256 333Net periodic benefit cost/(benefit) for other retiree benefits (1)(26) 4 (75) 14
(1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for those interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Form 8-K filed October 26, 2015 to update the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.The disclosures above for both share-based compensation and postretirement benefits include amounts related to discontinued operations which were not material in any period presented.


Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.




6.  Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.  The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.  Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  Except for the impairment charges related to our Batteries business (see Note 4), there were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2016.The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period:
Fair Value Asset March 31, 2016 June 30, 2015Investments   U.S. government securities$4,622 $3,495Corporate bond securities1,302 1,272Other investments28 30Total$5,952 $4,797
Investment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets.  The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $201 as of March 31, 2016 and $700 as of June 30, 2015.  The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $4,401 as of March 31, 2016 and $2,789 as of June 30, 2015.  The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $321 as of March 31, 2016 and $221 as of June 30, 2015.  The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $977 as of March 31, 2016 and $1,052 as of June 30, 2015.  The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  There are no material investment balances classified as either Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments.The fair value of long-term debt was $24,266 and $23,127 as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.  This includes the current portion ($2,641 and $2,776 as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively) of debt instruments.  Certain long-term debt is recorded at fair value.  Certain long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  Long-term debt with fair value of $2,328 and $2,180 as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively, is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  All remaining long-term debt is classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.The following table sets forth the notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015:

All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.  All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities.  The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the Company's derivative activity during the period.  All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

8.  Earnings Per Share
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) are divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate basic net earnings per common share.  Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated to give effect to stock options and other stock-based awards and assume conversion of preferred stock.  Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble and common shares used to calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share were as follows:

(1) Despite being included currently in diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion of preferred shares to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.  Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035.(2) Outstanding stock options of approximately 33 million and 10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately 51 million and  4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were not included in the diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares).(3) Basic net earnings per common share and diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.


9.  Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.  In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy.The Company expects to incur in excess of $5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017), including costs incurred as part of the ongoing and incremental restructuring program.  The program includes a non-manufacturing overhead enrollment reduction target of 25% - 30% by the end of fiscal 2017.Through fiscal 2015, the Company reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 12,600, or approximately 21%.  Through March 31, 2016, the Company reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 14,100, or approximately 24%.  The reductions are enabled by the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology and optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint.  In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  Through fiscal 2015, the Company incurred charges of approximately $3.9 billion.  Approximately $2.0 billion of these charges were related to separations, $954 were asset-related costs and $944 were related to other restructuring-type costs.For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $229 and $591, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 $32 and $121 of these charges were recorded in SG&A, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 $192 and $445 of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold, respectively.  The remainder of the charges was included in discontinued operations.  The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2016:
Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016   Accrual Balance June 30, 2015 Charges Previously Reported                    (Six Months Ended December 31, 2015) Charges for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Cash Spent Charges Against Assets Accrual Balance March 31, 2016Separations$362 $125 $46 $(283) $— $250Asset-related costs— 119 119 — (238) —Other costs27 118 64 (167) — 42Total$389 $362 $229 $(450) $(238) $292
Separation Costs
Employee separation charges for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 relate to severance packages for approximately 570 and 2,040 employees, respectively.  Separations related to non-manufacturing employees were approximately 260 and 750 employees for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016.  The packages are predominantly voluntary and the amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.  Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately 16,340 employees, of which approximately 9,370 are non-manufacturing overhead personnel.
Asset-Related Costs
Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges.
Other Costs
Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes.Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting.  Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.  However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments:

10.  Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and tax.  With respect to these and other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 140 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 60 – 70 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued liabilities of approximately $300, including interest and penalties.Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in the Form 8-K filed October 26, 2015 to update the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015.


11.  Discontinued Operations
On July 9, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to divest four product categories which will be merged with Coty, Inc. (“Coty”).  The divestiture was initially comprised of 43 of the Company's beauty brands (“Beauty Brands”), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  Subsequent to signing, two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture.  In connection with the decision to exclude these brands, the Company recorded a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge in discontinued operations of approximately $48 ($42 after-tax) in the three month period ended March 31, 2016 in order to record the Dolce & Gabbana license intangible asset at its estimated net realizable value.  While the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the Company’s current preference is for a Reverse Morris Trust split-off transaction in which P&G shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange their P&G shares for shares of a new corporation that would hold the Beauty Brands and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares.  The Company expects to close the transaction in the second half of calendar year 2016, pending regulatory approvals.Coty’s offer for the Beauty Brands, which was accepted by the Company, was $12.5 billion.  The final value of the transaction will be determined at closing.  Based on Coty’s stock price and outstanding shares and equity grants as of March 31, 2016, the value of the transaction was approximately $13.5 billion.  The value is comprised of approximately 412 million shares, or 54% of the diluted equity of the newly combined company, valued at approximately $11.5 billion and the assumption of debt of $2.0 billion by the entity holding the Beauty Brands immediately prior to close of the transaction.  The assumed debt is expected to vary between $3.9 billion and $1.9 billion, depending on a $22.06 to $27.06 per share collar of Coty’s stock based on the trading price prior to the close of the transaction, but will be subject to other contractual valuation adjustments including an adjustment for the exclusion of Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera fine fragrance brands.The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  Additionally, the Beauty Brands' balance sheet positions as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015 are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged Duracell, which the Company had infused with approximately $1.9 billion of additional cash, to repurchase all 52.5 million shares of P&G stock owned by BH.  During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded non-cash, before-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges of $402 ($350 after-tax), to reduce the value to the total estimated proceeds based on the value of BH’s shares in P&G stock at the time of the impairment charges (see Note 4).  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $422 to reflect the final value of the BH’s shares in P&G stock.  The total value of the transaction was $4.2 billion representing the value of the Duracell business and the cash capitalization.  This amount was reflected as an increase in treasury stock.The Batteries business has historically been part of the Company's Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  Additionally, the Batteries balance sheet position as of June 30, 2015 is presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in North America, Latin America and other selected countries to Mars, Incorporated (Mars) for $2.9 billion in an all-cash transaction.  Under the terms of the agreement, Mars acquired our branded pet care products and our manufacturing sites in the United States and assumed the majority of the employees working in the Pet Care business.  The European Union countries were not included in the agreement with Mars.  In December 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in Western Europe to Spectrum Brands in an all-cash transaction.  Under the terms of the agreement, Spectrum Brands acquired our branded pet care products and our manufacturing site in the Netherlands and assumed the majority of the employees working in the Western Europe Pet Care business.  The one-time after-tax impact of these transactions was not material.  The Pet Care business was historically part of the Company’s Health Care reportable segment.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2014-08, which included new reporting and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.  The new requirements are effective for discontinued operations occurring on or after the adoption date, which includes the Beauty Brands divestiture.  All other discontinued operations prior to July 1, 2015 are reported based on the previous disclosure requirements for discontinued operations, including the Batteries and Pet Care divestitures.The following table summarizes Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations and reconciles to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings:

MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016 •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016 •Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016 •Liquidity and Capital Resources•Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAPThroughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings.  We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity.  Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends.  Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges and the gain on the sale of the Batteries business.  We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management.  The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information.  References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates.  All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2015:•Net sales decreased 9% versus the previous year to $49.2 billion.  Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange and Venezuela deconsolidation, were unchanged.  Organic sales increased 2% in Fabric Care and Home Care, 1% in Grooming and in Health Care, decreased 1% in Baby, Feminine and Family Care, and were unchanged in Beauty.•Unit volume decreased 4% on an all-in and 2% on an organic basis.  Volume decreased low single digits in Fabric Care and Home Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care.•Net earnings from continuing operations were $8.0 billion, an increase of $228 million, or 3% versus the prior year period.  This increase was driven primarily by operating margin expansion, which more than offset the reduction in net sales.•Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $2.78.•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $8.6 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion, or 31% versus the prior year period.  This was primarily driven by a $1.8 billion increase in earnings from discontinued operations from incremental base period impairment charges of $1.6 billion related to our Batteries business and a $422 million gain on the sale of the Batteries business in the current period.•Core net earnings per share, which excludes discontinued operations, incremental restructuring charges, prior year charges for balance sheet remeasurement related to the Venezuelan currency and charges for certain European legal matters, increased 2% to $2.88.•Operating cash flow was $11.3 billion.  Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $9.3 billion.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges and the gain on sale of the Batteries business, was 108%.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies as commodity prices decline, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs.  Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts.  We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs.  If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012.  If we are not successful in executing these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange.  We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Russia and Turkey have had, and could have, an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.Government Policies.  Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies.  For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings.  Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and Ukraine.  Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.  During fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.For information on risk factors that could impact our results, refer to Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2016
The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 versus the three months ended March 31, 2015.

Net Sales
Net sales decreased 7% to $15.8 billion for the third quarter.  Unit volume decreased 2%.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 5%.  Sales growth in most business segments continued to benefit, to varying degrees, from price increases taken with new product innovations and/or to offset the impact of currency devaluation in markets such as Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Turkey.  Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%.  The impact of minor brand divestitures and the Venezuela deconsolidation reduced net sales by 3%.  Volume was unchanged in Fabric Care and Home Care and decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care and in Health Care.  Volume decreased mid-single digits in Beauty and in Grooming.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and decreased high single digits in developing regions.  Organic sales increased 1% driven by improved pricing on organic volume that was unchanged.

*  Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.**  Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions/divestitures, Venezuela deconsolidation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.
Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 250 basis points to 49.8% of net sales for the quarter.  Gross margin increased primarily due to a 230 basis point positive impact from manufacturing cost savings, a 130 basis point benefit from lower commodity costs and a 60 basis point benefit of higher pricing.  These impacts were partially offset by an 70 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 20 basis point decrease due to incremental restructuring charges, an 80 basis point decline from unfavorable mix, including product mix across segments (caused by a disproportionate decline in Grooming which has higher than average gross margin), product forms within certain businesses and other impacts.Total SG&A decreased 9% to $4.5 billion due to foreign exchange impacts and productivity efforts.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 28.7% due to lower foreign exchange transactional charges and the decreased overhead spending behind productivity efforts, partially offset by increased marketing spending and the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 130 basis points due to the negative scale impacts from reduced sales and increased advertising spending.  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points, as 60 basis points of productivity savings in overhead spending and a 50 basis point benefit from reduced restructuring activity were partially offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development and the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.  Lower foreign exchange transactional charges, from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency, reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by 100 basis points.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $146 million for the quarter, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year period, due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates.  Interest income was $33 million for the quarter, a decrease of $5 million versus the prior period. Other non-operating income was $21 million, a decrease of $32 million, due to a gain from a minor brand divestiture in the base period.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 850 basis points to 27.6%.  The current year rate increased due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings versus the base period, which had an unusually high benefit from favorable geographic mix, and the current year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of unfavorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions in the base period.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $64 million or 3% for the quarter.  This decrease was caused by the reduction in net sales and increase in the effective income tax rate, partially offset by the 320 basis point increase in operating income margin discussed above.  Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $89 million for the quarter due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the currencies of Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Turkey.  This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 1% to $0.81 due to decreased net earnings.
Discontinued Operations
The net earnings from discontinued operations improved by $659 million to $446 million in the current period versus a net loss of $213 million in the prior period.  This change was driven primarily by a $422 million current period after-tax gain from the sale of the Batteries business and a base period $308 million after-tax impairment charge in the Batteries business, partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the Beauty Brands which declined due to currency-driven declines in sales and operating income margin and an impairment charge associated with the Dolce & Gabbana license (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net Earnings
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $597 million or 28% to $2.8 billion for the quarter.  The increase was due to the increase in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by the decline in net earnings from continuing operations, both discussed above.  Diluted net earnings per share increased 29% to $0.97.  Core net earnings per share decreased 3% to $0.86.  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans and charges related to certain European legal matters.
Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts
There are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future.  These evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and  restricted our Venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.  For accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries.  Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting.  This resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our Venezuela subsidiaries, along with Venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries.  Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from the Venezuelan government.  Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ operations in our financial results.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016
The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2015.

Net Sales
Net sales decreased 9% to $49.2 billion fiscal year to date.  Unit volume decreased 4%.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 7%.  Higher pricing, primarily to offset inflation and devaluation, increased net sales by 2%. Volume decreased low single digits in Fabric Care and Home Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care and in Baby, Feminine and Family Care.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and decreased high single digits in developing regions due to increased pricing, competitive activity, minor brand divestitures and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation.  Organic sales were flat on a 2% decline in organic volume due to improved pricing.

*  Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.**  Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions/divestitures, Venezuela deconsolidation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.
Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 220 basis points to 50.1% of net sales for the fiscal year to date period.  Gross margin increased primarily due to a 180 basis point positive impact from manufacturing cost savings, a 110 basis point benefit from lower commodity costs and a 90 basis point benefit of higher pricing.  These impacts were partially offset by a 70 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 40 basis point decrease due to unfavorable product mix caused by the disproportionate decline of higher margin segments like Beauty and by product form mix within the segments, a 20 basis point decline due to incremental restructuring activity and a 30 basis point decrease from negative scale impacts due to lower volume and other impacts.Total SG&A decreased 13% to $13.7 billion due to foreign exchange impacts, productivity efforts in both overhead and marketing and a base period Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement charge.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points to 27.9%, due to lower net foreign exchange transactional charges and decreased spending behind productivity efforts, partially offset by the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points as lower spending did not keep pace with reduced sales.  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, as 70 basis points of productivity savings in overhead spending were partially offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development and the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.  Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by 110 basis points.  A Venezuelan balance sheet remeasurement charge in the base period prior to deconsolidation drove 30 basis points of this decline.  The balance of the reduction relates to lower transactional charges from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $429 million fiscal year to date, a decrease of $49 million versus the prior year period due to lower average debt and a decrease in weighted average interest rates.  Interest income was $135 million fiscal year to date, an increase of $32 million versus the prior period due to higher cash and investment balances.  Other non-operating income decreased $47 million to $38 million due to greater gains on the sale of minor brands in the base period.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 320 basis points to 24.9%. The current year rate increased due to the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings and the current year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations increased $228 million or 3% fiscal year to date.  This increase was caused by a 330 basis point increase in operating income margin discussed above, which more than offset the reduction in net sales.  Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $682 million fiscal year to date due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Russia.  This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $2.78 due to increased net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Discontinued Operations
The net earnings from discontinued operations improved $1.8 billion to $627 million fiscal year to date versus a net loss of $1.2 billion in the prior period.  This was driven primarily by a $1.7 billion reduction in after-tax impairment charges in the Batteries business ($350 million in the current nine month period compared to $2.0 billion in the base period) and a $422 million after-tax gain in the current period from the sale of the Batteries business, partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the Beauty Brands (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net Earnings
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $2.0 billion or 31% to $8.6 billion fiscal year to date.  The increase was due to the change in earnings from discontinued operations and the increase in net earnings from continuing operations (both discussed above).  Diluted net earnings per share increased 33% to $3.00.  Core net earnings per share increased 2% to $2.88.  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans, charges related to European legal matters in both years and prior year balance sheet remeasurement costs from the Venezuelan currency.







BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016
The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment.  Analyses of the results for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 are provided based on a comparison to the same three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2015.  The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations.  The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions):

Beauty
Three months ended March 31, 2016 compared with three months ended March 31, 2015
Beauty net sales decreased 8% to $2.7 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 5% decrease in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 5%.  Price increases had a 2% positive impact on net sales.  Organic sales increased 1% on organic volume that decreased 1%.  Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.9 points.  Volume decreased low single digits in developed markets.  Volume was down high single digits in developing markets, in part due to minor brand divestitures, and was down low single digits on an organic basis.•Volume in Hair Care was down low single digits due to minor brand divestitures and Venezuela deconsolidation.  Organic volume was unchanged.  Developed markets declined low single digits due to competitive activity while developing markets declined mid-single digits due to minor brand divestitures and Venezuela deconsolidation.  Organic volume was unchanged in developing markets.  Global market share of the hair care category decreased a point.•Volume in Skin and Personal Care decreased high single digits, while organic volume decreased low single digits, with the difference attributable to the Camay and Zest brand divestitures and Venezuela deconsolidation.  Volume decreased low single digits in developed regions as declines due to competitive activity were only partially offset by growth in super-premium skin.  Volume decreased double digits in developing regions with organic volume down mid-single digits primarily due to competitive activity.  Global market share of the skin and personal care category decreased a point.Net earnings decreased 5% to $458 million primarily due to the reduction in net sales, partially offset by a 60 basis point increase in net earnings margin as an increase in gross margin more than offset an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  Gross margin increased primarily due to increased pricing and productivity savings which were only partially offset by unfavorable product mix in both Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased as cost savings from productivity efforts were more than offset by the negative scale impact from the reduction in sales.Beauty net sales decreased 10% to $8.7 billion fiscal year to date on a 6% decrease in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 7%.  Price increases added 2% and favorable geographic mix had a 1% positive impact on net sales due to the disproportionate decline in developing region volume, which has lower than segment-average selling prices.  Organic sales were unchanged on organic volume that decreased 3%.  Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 1.0 point.  Volume decreased mid-single digits in developed markets.  Volume was down high single digits in developing markets, in part due to minor brand divestitures, and was down low single digits on an organic basis.•Volume in Hair Care was down mid-single digits.  Developed markets declined mid-single digits due to competitive activity while developing markets also declined mid-single digits driven by increased pricing, the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures.  Global market share of the hair care category decreased more than a point.•Volume in Skin and Personal Care decreased double digits, while organic volume decreased mid-single digits, with the difference attributable to the Camay and Zest brand divestitures and Venezuela deconsolidation.  Organic volume was unchanged in developed regions as commercial innovation was offset by ongoing competitive activity.  Organic volume declined high single digits in developing regions primarily due to increased pricing and competitive activity.  Global market share of the skin and personal care category decreased more than a point.Net earnings decreased 3% to $1.7 billion primarily due to the reduction in net sales, partially offset by a 130 basis point increase in net earnings margin, primarily behind gross margin expansion.  Gross margin increased primarily due to increased pricing and productivity savings.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased slightly, as lower marketing and overhead spending from the Company's focus on efficiencies was more than offset by the reduction in sales.

Net earnings margin decreased 10 basis points.  Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings and lower commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable product mix from the decline in Baby Care.  Higher gross margin was offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to investments in marketing, the negative scale impact from the reduction in net sales and a higher tax rate versus the prior year due to the geographic mix of earnings.Baby, Feminine and Family Care net sales decreased 10% to $13.9 billion fiscal year to date on a 4% decline in unit volume.

Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments.  These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; certain significant asset impairment charges; and certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales decreased $15 million during the third fiscal quarter and $32 million fiscal year to date.  Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $86 million in the third fiscal quarter due mainly to decreased foreign exchange transactional charges and reduced restructuring charges in the current period, partially offset by higher taxes.  Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $630 million fiscal year to date, primarily due to decreased foreign exchange transactional charges (including a base period Venezuelan balance sheet remeasurement charge). Additional discussion of these items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.
Productivity and Cost Savings Plan
In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.As part of this plan, which has been expanded since its inception, the Company expects to incur in excess of $5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017).  Approximately 90% of the estimated costs have been incurred through March 2016.  Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment.  Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3 billion in annual gross savings (before-tax).  The cumulative before-tax savings as of the current year are estimated at approximately $2.2 to $2.5 billion.  Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.
Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.

LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
We generated $11.3 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $676 million versus the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of businesses and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges), generated $11.4 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts used $68 million of cash in the period.  Accounts receivable used $129 million of cash primarily due to sales mix.  Inventory consumed $94 million of cash.  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $199 million of cash primarily due to a decrease in taxes payable due to the timing of estimated payments.  All other operating assets and liabilities generated $354 million of cash primarily due the reduction of prepaid marketing balances.
Investing Activities
Cash used by investing activities was $4.4 billion fiscal year to date.  Capital expenditures were $2.0 billion, or 4.1% of net sales. Divestiture transactions used cash of $1.1 billion including cash held in restricted accounts of $1.0 billion in connection with the pending sale of the Beauty Brands.  We used $2.4 billion for purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by cash generated from proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments of $1.2 billion.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities consumed net cash of $5.6 billion fiscal year to date.  We used $3.5 billion for treasury stock purchases and $5.6 billion for dividends.  Cash generated from net debt issuances was $3.2 billion.  We transferred $1.7 billion of cash to repurchase P&G stock owned by Berkshire Hathaway in the Batteries divestiture.  Cash from the exercise of stock options generated $2.0 billion of cash.As of March 31, 2016, our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $3.0 billion.  Excluding assets and liabilities of the Batteries and Beauty businesses held for sale, current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.8 billion.  We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in the MD&A and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business results and trends and provide a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to more fully understand our business results.  When a non-GAAP measure is used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:•charges for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings,•charges for European legal matters, and•charges for balance sheet impacts from the devaluation of the foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela prior to deconsolidation.We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results.  Organic sales growth:  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Core EPS or Core net earnings per share:  Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated.  Free cash flow:  Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending.  We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity:  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges and the gain on the sale of the Batteries business.  We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  Basis of Presentation
These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.  However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.


2.  New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".  This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.  We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2018.  While we are currently assessing the impact of the new standard, our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers.  Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer.  These are largely un-impacted by the new standard.  Therefore we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes".  This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance sheet by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current.  The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  The impact was not significant.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)".  The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements.  We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019.  We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.  The new guidance requires excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at vest or settlement over the benefits recognized at issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at vest or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized at issuance of share-based payments) to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.  The amended guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, rather than a financing activity.  The standard further provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than utilizing the estimated amount of forfeitures at the time of issuance.  The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our Income taxes on continuing operations rather than in Additional paid-in capital for fiscal year 2017.  As a result, we recognized excess tax benefits of $189 in Income taxes on continuing operations during the nine months ended March 31, 2017.  We also elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.  None of the other provisions in this amended guidance had a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.


Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.




3.  Segment Information
As discussed in Note 11, the Beauty Brands and Batteries businesses are presented as discontinued operations and are excluded from segment results for all periods presented.  Effective July 1, 2016, the Company began accounting for sales to and related earnings from its Venezuela subsidiaries in Corporate for management reporting purposes.  As a result, we are also reflecting such sales and earnings in Corporate for segment reporting purposes.  This change was made on a prospective basis for both management and external segment reporting purposes and did not have a significant impact on any of the segments.Following is a summary of reportable segment results:

4.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows:
Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total CompanyGoodwill at June 30, 2016$12,645 $19,477 $5,840 $1,856 $4,532 $44,350Acquisitions and divestitures— — (10) (3) — (13)Translation and other(227) (259) (74) (24) (71) (655)Goodwill at March 31, 2017$12,418 $19,218 $5,756 $1,829 $4,461 $43,682
On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 41 of its beauty brands ("Beauty Brands"), to Coty, Inc.  The transaction included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color and cosmetics businesses and a majority of the fine fragrances business, along with select hair styling brands (see Note 11).  The Beauty Brands have historically been part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations.  As a result, the goodwill attributable to the Beauty Brands as of June 30, 2016 is excluded from the preceding table and is reported as Current assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Goodwill decreased from June 30, 2016 primarily due to currency translation.The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill.  The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination.  If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.  However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high.  While both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the Shave Care cushion, as well as the related indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have been reduced to below 10% due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that began in recent years.  As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles (carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as of March 31, 2017 are $18.9 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively).Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2017 are comprised of:
Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated AmortizationIntangible assets with determinable lives$7,310 $(4,757)Intangible assets with indefinite lives21,600 —Total identifiable intangible assets$28,910 $(4,757)
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships.  The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands.  The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $79 and $98, respectively.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the amortization expense of intangible assets was $248 and $301, respectively.


Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.




5.  Earnings Per Share
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) are divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate Basic net earnings per common share.  Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated to give effect to stock options and other stock-based awards and assume conversion of preferred stock.  Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble and common shares used to calculate Basic and Diluted net earnings per share were as follows:

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.



(1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.  Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035.(2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 7 million and 33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and approximately 16 million and 51 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares).(3) Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.


6.  Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits
The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs:

(1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for those interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.The disclosures above for both share-based compensation and postretirement benefits include amounts related to discontinued operations which were not material in any period presented.


7.  Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2017.The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.

9.  Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.  In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy.The Company expects to incur approximately $5.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017), including costs incurred as part of the ongoing and incremental restructuring program.  The program includes a non-manufacturing overhead enrollment reduction target of approximately 25% - 30% by the end of fiscal 2017.Through March 31, 2017, the Company reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 26%.  The reductions are enabled by the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology and optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint.  In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  Through fiscal 2016, the Company incurred charges of approximately $4.9 billion.  Approximately $2.3 billion of these charges were related to separations, $1.4 billion were asset-related costs and $1.2 billion were related to other restructuring-type costs.For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $157 and $505, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2017, $25 and $72 of these charges were recorded in SG&A, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2017, $132 and $409 of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold, respectively.  The remainder of the charges were included in discontinued operations.  The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2017:
Nine Months Ended                                                                           March 31, 2017   Accrual Balance                                                    June 30, 2016 Charges Previously Reported                             (Six Months Ended December 31, 2016) Charges for the Three Months Ended                                              March 31, 2017 Cash Spent (1) Charges Against Assets Accrual Balance March 31, 2017Separations$243 $96 $43 $(182) $— $200Asset-related costs— 206 80 — (286) —Other costs72 46 34 (104) — 48Total$315 $348 $157 $(286) $(286) $248
(1) Includes liabilities transferred to Coty related to our Beauty Brands divestiture.
Separation Costs
Employee separation charges for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2017 relate to severance packages for approximately 480 and 1,520 employees, respectively.  Separations related to non-manufacturing employees were approximately 70 and 260 employees for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2017, respectively.  The packages are predominantly voluntary and the amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.  Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately 18,590 employees, of which approximately 9,800 are non-manufacturing overhead personnel.
Asset-Related Costs
Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges.
Other Costs
Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes.Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting.  Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.  However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments:

10.  Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and tax.  With respect to these and other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 140 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 – 60 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued liabilities of approximately $170, including interest and penalties.Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.


11.  Discontinued Operations
On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories to Coty, Inc. (“Coty”).  The divestiture included 41 of the Company's beauty brands (“Beauty Brands”), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and a majority of the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  The form of the divestiture transaction was a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, in which P&G shareholders were given the election to exchange their P&G shares for shares of a new corporation that held the Beauty Brands (Galleria Co.), and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares.  The value P&G received in the transaction was $11.4 billion.  The value is comprised of 105 million shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for the Galleria Co. shares, valued at approximately $9.4 billion, and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt by Galleria Co..  The shares tendered in the transaction were reflected as an addition to treasury stock and the cash received related to the debt assumed by Coty was reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $5.3 billion, net of transaction and related costs.Two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture.  These brands were subsequently divested at amounts that approximated their adjusted carrying values.In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged Duracell, which the Company had infused with approximately $1.9 billion of additional cash, to repurchase all 52.5 million shares of P&G stock owned by BH.  During fiscal 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash, before-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charge of $402 ($350 after-tax), to reduce the value to the total estimated proceeds based on the value of BH’s shares in P&G stock at the time of the impairment charges.  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $422 to reflect the final value of the BH’s shares in P&G stock.  The total value of the transaction was $4.2 billion representing the value of the Duracell business and the cash infusion.  The cash infusion was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands and Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  Additionally, the Beauty Brands' balance sheet positions are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016.  The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  The Batteries business was historically part of the Company's Fabric & Home Care reportable segment.On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2014-08, which included new reporting and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.  The new requirements are effective for discontinued operations occurring on or after the adoption date, which includes the Beauty Brands divestiture.  All other discontinued operations prior to July 1, 2015 are reported based on the previous disclosure requirements for discontinued operations, including the Batteries divestiture.The following table summarizes Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations and reconciles to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings:

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2016:•Net sales were unchanged versus the previous period at $49.0 billion.  Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%.  Organic sales increased 2% in Beauty, 7% in Health Care, 2% in Fabric & Home Care, 1% in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and were unchanged in Grooming.•Unit volume increased 1% with organic volume up 2%.  Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and low single digits in Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Grooming.  Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty.  Excluding the impacts of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in Beauty.•Net earnings from continuing operations were $8.0 billion, unchanged  versus the prior year period.  An increase in operating income, primarily driven by gains on the sale of real estate, and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate were offset by an increase in other non-operating expense due mainly to a charge related to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.•Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 3% to $2.87 due to reduced shares outstanding from shares tendered in the divestiture of the Beauty Brands to Coty.•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $13.1 billion, an increase of $4.6 billion or 53% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by the $5.3 billion after-tax gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the current period partially offset by the base-period results of discontinued operations, including  the net results of the Beauty Brands and a gain on the sale of the Batteries business. •Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which excludes discontinued operations, the charge related to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges, increased 3% to $8.5 billion.  Core net earnings per share increased 7% to $3.07 due to the increase in core net earnings and the reduction in shares outstanding.•Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion.  Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to the sale of the Beauty Brands, was $7.0 billion.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding a loss on early debt extinguishment and the gain on sale of the Beauty business, was 86%.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs.  Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts.  We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs.  If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange.  We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Over the past four years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.Government Policies.  Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies.  For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings.  Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria and Ukraine.  Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.  For example, during fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2016.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2017
The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter decreased 1% to $15.6 billion.  Unit volume was unchanged.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Pricing and mix had no net impact on consolidated net sales.  Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Volume was unchanged in Fabric & Home Care and Grooming and decreased low single digits in Beauty driven by minor brand divestitures.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.  Organic sales increased 1% driven by a 1% increase in organic volume.

*  Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. **  Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions/divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.
Operating Costs
Gross margin was unchanged at 49.8% of net sales for the quarter.  Gross margin benefited from a 210 basis point impact from total manufacturing cost savings (180 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), a 40 basis point impact from lower incremental restructuring charges and a 10 basis point impact from increased volume scale leverage.  These impacts were offset by a 100 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily between segments caused by the disproportionate net sales declines in Beauty and Grooming, both of which have higher than company-average gross margins, and within segments due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products), a 80 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs, a 20 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and 30 basis points from other impacts, including costs incurred from tornado damage to a U.S. Family Care distribution facility.Total SG&A spending decreased 2% to $4.4 billion as a reduction in other operating expense, primarily from a gain on the sale of real estate, was partially offset by increases in marketing and overhead spending.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 28.3%, as a 130 basis point benefit in other operating income, including the gain on the sale of real estate, was partially offset by increases in overhead and marketing as a percent of net sales.  Overhead costs as percent of net sales increased 70 basis points as wage inflation and investments in R&D and sales resources were partially offset by cost savings.  Marketing spending as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points as investments in advertising were partially offset by reductions in agency compensation.  Overall cost savings delivered 50 basis points of benefit in SG&A.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $96 million for the quarter, a decrease of $50 million versus the prior year period, due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates and a decline in the average debt outstanding.  Interest income was $46 million for the quarter, an increase of $13 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents.  Other non-operating income/(loss) was $26 million, an increase of $5 million.
Income Taxes on Continuing Operations
The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 420 basis points to 23.4%.  The decline was due to impacts from excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting (180 basis points), discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 140 basis points in the current year versus zero in the prior year), and the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards (270 basis points).  These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a higher proportion of U.S. earnings.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations increased $219 million or 9% to $2.6 billion for the quarter.  This increase was driven by the lower effective tax rate and reduced interest expense along with a 1% increase in operating income.  Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $80 million for the quarter due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the currencies of Egypt, Turkey and the United Kingdom.  This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.93 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in number of weighted average shares outstanding following the shares tendered in the sale of the Beauty Brands to Coty (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), along with ongoing share repurchases.
Discontinued Operations
Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in the current period versus $446 million in the prior year.  The base period result was driven primarily by a gain on sale of the Batteries business.  The sale of the Beauty Brands closed in the second fiscal quarter of the current year.  Accordingly, there are no results of discontinued operations reported in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net Earnings
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $228 million or 8% to $2.5 billion for the quarter.  The decrease was driven by a reduction in earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by the increase in earnings from continuing operations, both discussed above.  Diluted net earnings per share decreased 4% to $0.93.  The difference between the decrease in net earnings and the decrease in the related earnings per share was due to the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.  Core net earnings per share increased 12% to $0.96.  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017
The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2016.

Net Sales
Net sales fiscal year to date were unchanged versus the previous period at $49.0 billion.  Unit volume increased 1%.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Pricing and mix had no net impact on consolidated net sales.  Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and low single digits in Grooming, Fabric & Home Care and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty driven by minor brand divestitures.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.  Organic sales increased 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 50.5% of net sales for the fiscal year to date period.  Gross margin increased primarily due to a 220 basis point positive impact from total manufacturing cost savings (190 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments) along with minor benefits from lower incremental restructuring charges and increased volume scale leverage.  These impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily between segments caused by the lower relative proportion of sales in Beauty and Grooming, both of which have higher than company-average gross margins, and within segments due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products) and 50 basis points of combined negative impact from higher commodities and other costs.Total SG&A spending was unchanged at $13.7 billion.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 28.0%.  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to an increase in advertising and other activities, partially offset by productivity savings.  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points due to wage inflation and investments in R&D and sales resources.  These impacts were partially offset by an 80 basis point decline in  other operating expense due to reduced net foreign exchange transactional costs and a gain on the sale of real estate.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $349 million for the fiscal year to date period, a decrease of $80 million versus the prior year period, due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates and a decline in the average debt outstanding.  Interest income was $123 million for the fiscal year to date period, a decrease of $12 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents.  Other non-operating income/(loss) was $(450) million, a decrease of $488 million, primarily due to a $543 million charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt incurred in the second fiscal quarter.
Income Taxes on Continuing Operations
The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 230 basis points to 22.6%.  The rate declined due to excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting (180 basis points), discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 160 basis points in the current year versus 50 basis points in the prior year), the tax impact of the early retirement of certain debts (70 basis points) and the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards (80 basis points).  These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a higher proportion of U.S. earnings.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations was unchanged at $8.0 billion for the fiscal year to date period.  A reduction in earnings before tax, primarily driven by a $345 million after-tax charge related to the early extinguishment of long-term debt, was offset by the lower effective tax rate.  Operating income increased 1% due to the improvement in gross margin discussed above.  Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $420 million fiscal year to date due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the currencies of Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and the United Kingdom.  This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 3% to $2.87 due to the decline in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.
Discontinued Operations
Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion in the current period versus $0.6 billion in the prior period.  This change was driven by the $5.3 billion gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the second fiscal quarter of the current period, partially offset by the base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net Earnings
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $4.6 billion or 53% to $13.1 billion for the fiscal year to date period.  The increase was driven by the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the charge related to the early extinguishment of debt, each discussed above.  Diluted net earnings per share increased 59% to $4.76.  The difference between the increase in net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble and the increase in the related earnings per share was due to the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.  Core net earnings per share increased 7% to $3.07.  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans.

Beauty
Three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with three months ended March 31, 2016
Beauty net sales decreased 2% to $2.7 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 2% decrease in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1%. Price increases added 1% to net sales.  Organic sales increased 1% on organic volume that was unchanged.  Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.6 points.  Volume decreased mid-single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.  Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in developing regions.   •Volume in Hair Care decreased low single digits due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume increased low single digits.  Developed market volume decreased mid-single digits following increased pricing and due to competitive activity and reduced customer inventory.  Developing regions declined low single digits due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume increased low single digits in developing regions behind product innovation, increased marketing spending and market growth.  Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased half a point. •Volume in Skin and Personal Care decreased low single digits.  Volume decreased high single digits in developed regions following increased pricing and reduced promotional events at certain customers.  Volume increased low single digits in developing regions due to product innovation and increased marketing.  Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased more than half a point. Net earnings decreased 14% to $396 million due to the reduction in net sales and a 210 basis point decrease in net earnings margin.  The net earnings margin declined primarily due to an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to increased marketing spending to support initiatives and increased overhead spending on sales resources.  Gross margin decreased slightly as higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix impacts  in Hair Care (primarily from an increase in the proportion of lower margin brands along with unfavorable geographic mix) were only partially offset by productivity savings and the benefit of higher pricing.   Beauty fiscal year to date net sales decreased 1% to $8.6 billion on a 2% decrease in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Increased pricing added 1% to net sales and favorable product mix also added 1% primarily due to growth of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than average selling prices.  Organic sales increased 2% on organic volume that increased 1%.  Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.7 points.  Volume decreased low single digits in developed regions.  Volume also decreased low single digits in developing regions, mainly due to minor brand divestitures, but increased mid-single digits on an organic basis.   •Volume in Hair Care decreased low single digits due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume increased low single digits.  Developed regions declined low single digits mainly due to competitive activity and developing regions declined low single digits due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume increased mid-single digits in developing regions behind product innovation, increased marketing and market growth.  Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased less than a point. •Volume in Skin and Personal Care decreased low single digits.  Developed market volume decreased low single digits following increased pricing and due to competitive activity.  Volume increased low single digits in developing regions including the impact of minor brand divestitures. Organic volume was up mid-single digits in developing regions behind innovation, increased marketing and market growth.  Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased half a point. Net earnings decreased 8% to $1.5 billion due to the reduction in net sales and a 140 basis point decrease in net earnings margin, behind an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to increased marketing spending to support initiatives and increased overhead spending on sales resources.  Gross margin decreased slightly as the benefits from productivity savings and higher pricing were more than offset by higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix impacts (primarily from an increase in the proportion of lower margin brands along with unfavorable geographic mix).
Nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2016
Grooming
Three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with three months ended March 31, 2016
Grooming net sales decreased 6% to $1.5 billion during the third fiscal quarter on unit volume that was unchanged.  Price reductions in Shave Care reduced net sales by 2%.  Unfavorable geographic mix reduced net sales by 4% driven by decline in developed markets, where average selling prices are higher than in developing regions.  Organic sales decreased 6% on organic volume that was unchanged.  Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.5 points.  Volume decreased mid-single digits in developed regions and increased low single digits in developing regions.  •Shave Care volume decreased low single digits.  Shave Care volume decreased high single digits in developed regions due to competitive activity and increased mid-single digits in developing regions behind product innovation.  Global market share of the Shave Care category decreased more than half a point. •Volume in Appliances increased double digits.  Volume was up double digits in developed regions due to product innovation and decreased mid-single digits in developing regions following increased pricing.  Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 6% to $333 million due to the reduction in net sales.  Net earnings margin decreased 10 basis points as an increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales more than offset an increase in gross margin.  SG&A as a percent of net sales increased due to an increase in overhead spending.  Gross margin increased as the benefit of cost savings projects more than offset the negative impact of lower pricing and unfavorable geographic mix (from the disproportionate decline of developed market volume, which has higher than segment-average margin). Grooming fiscal year to date net sales decreased 3% to $5.0 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Unfavorable geographic mix reduced net sales by 2% driven by growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than in developed regions, in part due to a higher relative proportion of disposable razors in those markets.  Organic sales were unchanged on organic volume that increased 2%.  Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.5 points.  Volume decreased low single digits in developed regions and increased low single digits in developing regions.   •Shave Care volume increased low single digits.  Shave Care volume decreased low single digits in developed regions due to competitive activity and increased low single digits in developing regions behind product innovation and increased marketing support.  Organic volume increased mid-single digits in developing regions.  Global market share of the Shave Care category decreased half a point. •Volume in Appliances increased high single digits.  Volume was up double digits in developed regions and low single digits in developing regions due to product innovation.   Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 3% to $1.2 billion due to a 120 basis-point increase in net earnings margin which more than offset the reduction in net sales.  Net earnings margin improved behind both gross margin expansion and a reduction in SG&A as a percent of net sales.  Gross margin increased as the benefits of productivity efforts were only partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and negative product mix driven by the disproportionate growth of disposable razors, which have below segment-average margins.  SG&A as a percent of net sales decreased due to a gain on the sale of real estate partially offset by increased overhead and marketing spending.

Nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2016
Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments.  These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; certain significant asset impairment charges; and certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales increased 28% to $136 million during the third fiscal quarter and increased 17% to $380 million fiscal year to date both primarily due to an increase in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level.  Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by $401 million in the third fiscal quarter and by $271 million fiscal year to date.  Corporate net earnings increased in the third quarter due to 1) a current fiscal year sale of real estate, 2) lower restructuring charges compared to the prior year, 3) an increase in the proportion of corporate overhead spending which is allocated to the segments, consisting in part of stranded overheads from divestiture, and 4) current year tax benefits resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Corporate net earnings increased fiscal year to date due to the reasons affecting the third quarter discussed above, partially offset by a $345 million after-tax charge on the early extinguishment of long-term debt during the second quarter.
Productivity and Cost Savings Plan
In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.As part of this plan, which has been expanded since its inception, the Company expects to incur approximately $5.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017).  Approximately 98% of the estimated costs have been incurred through March 2017.  Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment.  Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3 billion in annual gross savings (before-tax).  The cumulative before-tax savings as of the current year are estimated at approximately $2.5 to $3 billion.  Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.





Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.


LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
We generated $9.1 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $2.2 billion versus the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on early extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, and gain on sale of businesses), generated $10.2 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts used $1.1 billion of cash in the period.  Accounts receivable used $159 million of cash due to sales growth late in the quarter partially offset by collection of approximately $150 million of retained receivables from the Beauty Brands business.  Inventory consumed $145 million of cash due to product initiatives and business growth in certain GBUs and reduced consumption in certain other GBUs.  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $1.1 billion of cash primarily due to the payment of prior fiscal year accruals and the impacts of the Beauty Brands divestiture, including the payment of approximately $450 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities retained by the company pursuant to the terms of the agreement.  We also paid $204 million of taxes related to the divestiture.  All other operating assets and liabilities generated $267 million of cash.
Investing Activities
Cash used by investing activities was $3.8 billion fiscal year to date.  Capital expenditures were $2.2 billion, or 4.6% of net sales.  We generated $411 million of cash from proceeds from asset sales primarily from building sales and minor brand divestitures.  We initially invested $874 million of cash, received from the pre-Beauty Brands divestiture issuance of transaction-related debt, in restricted cash.  We transferred $475 million of cash at closing to the discontinued Beauty Brands.  At transaction closing, cumulative restricted cash of $1.9 billion was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents.  We used $3.4 billion for purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by $834 million of cash generated from proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities consumed net cash of $6.3 billion fiscal year to date.  We used $4.5 billion for treasury stock purchases and $5.4 billion for dividends.  Cash generated from the net effect of debt issuances and payments was $1.2 billion.  Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $2.4 billion of cash.As of March 31, 2017, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $3.2 billion.  We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:Incremental restructuring:  The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities.  Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax.  Beginning in 2012 Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities.  This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings.  The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.  Early debt extinguishment charges:  During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $345 million after tax due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.  This charge represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.  Management does not view this charge as indicative of the Company’s operating performance or underlying business results. Charges for certain European legal matters:  Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods.  The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges.  Management does not view these charges as indicative of underlying business results. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.  These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Organic sales growth:  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Adjusted free cash flow:  Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding tax payments related to the Beauty Brands divestiture, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance.  Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Adjusted free cash flow productivity:  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the loss on early debt extinguishment and gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying earnings performance.  Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS:  Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated.  Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  Basis of Presentation
These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.  However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.


2.  New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies and U.S. Tax Reform
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."  This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.  We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method.  While we are currently assessing the impact of the new standard, our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers.  Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer.  The timing of revenue recognition is not materially impacted by the new standard.  The provisions of the new standard may impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving an immaterial amount of such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales.  The impact would reduce net sales by less than 1%.  We are still assessing the impact on financial disclosures related to the new standard.  We do not expect this new guidance to have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)."  The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements.  We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019.  We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."  The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety.  This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach.  It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020.  The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, "Compensation-Retirement Benefits:  Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715)."  This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement.  It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement, with other components of net benefit cost presented outside of income from operations.  We currently classify all net periodic pension costs within operating costs (as part of Cost of products sold and Selling, general and administrative expense).  We will adopt the standard retrospectively no later than July 1, 2018.  The adoption of ASU 2017-07 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities."  This standard enables entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in the financial statements and enhances the transparency and understandability of hedge results through improved disclosures.  The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  The amended presentation and disclosure guidance was applied on a prospective basis.  The primary impact of adoption is the required disclosure changes.  The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the cumulative-effect adjustment required upon adoption.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”).  The U.S. Tax Act significantly revises the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering U. S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a territorial tax system.  As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years.  However, the U.S. Tax Act eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system, which also eliminates the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Act.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, these impacts resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $210 million, as the majority of the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal rate was offset by the inability to fully credit foreign taxes that were previously included in our estimated annual effective tax rate.  This impact, along with the transitional taxes discussed in the paragraph below, are being reflected in the Corporate Segment for both management and segment reporting for fiscal 2018.There are also certain transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act.  As part of the transition to the new territorial tax system, the U.S. Tax Act imposes a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate will cause us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21%.  These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $650 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.9 billion (comprised of the U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion.
The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex.  The final transition impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the U.S. Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the U.S. Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the U.S. Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries.  The Securities Exchange Commission has issued rules that would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the U.S. Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.  We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments within the one year time period provided by the Securities Exchange Commission.

Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships.  The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands.  The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $75 and $79, respectively.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the amortization expense of intangible assets was $227 and $248, respectively.

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill.  The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination.  If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.  However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high.  Both of these wholly acquired reporting units have fair value cushions (the fair values currently exceed the underlying carrying values).  However, the overall Shave Care cushion and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion have both been reduced to below 10%, both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the U.S., a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years and resulted in reduced cash flow projections.  As a result, this reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the residual net sales and earnings growth rates and discount rate.  The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter term business planning period.  The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates.  The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share.  As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.  The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure.  Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar.  While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.  As of March 31, 2018, the carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are $19.9 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively.The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the residual growth rate and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values.  The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 50 basis point decrease to our residual growth rate or a 50 basis point increase to our discount rate.

5.  Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits), by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.Net earnings per share were as follows:

(1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.  Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035.(2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 54 million and 7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and approximately 24 million and 16 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares).
(3) Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

7.  Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.  The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.  Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2018.The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period:

value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments.The fair value of long-term debt was $25,472 and $21,396 as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.  This includes the current portion ($1,763 and $1,694 as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively) of debt instruments.  Certain long-term debt is recorded at fair value.  Certain long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  Long-term debt with fair value of $1,862 and $1,716 as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  All remaining long-term debt is classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.The following table sets forth the notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017:

9.  Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses.  During fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion in before-tax restructuring costs under the plan.  This program is expected to result in meaningful incremental non-manufacturing enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $205 and $516, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018, $75 and $162 of these charges were recorded in SG&A, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018, $130 and $354 of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold, respectively.  The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2018:
Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018   Accrual Balance June 30, 2017 Charges Previously Reported                    (Six Months Ended                            December 31, 2017) Charges for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Cash Spent Charges Against Assets Accrual Balance March 31, 2018Separations$228 $113 $69 $(177) $— $233Asset-related costs— 144 88 — (232) —Other costs49 54 48 (113) — 38Total$277 $311 $205 $(290) $(232) $271
Separation Costs
Employee separation charges for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 relate to severance packages for approximately 430 and 1,410 employees, respectively.  Separations related to non-manufacturing employees were approximately 190 and 580 for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018, respectively.  The packages were predominantly voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.
Asset-Related Costs
Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges.
Other Costs
Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization.Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting.  Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.  However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments:

10.  Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and tax.  With respect to these and other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in approximately 140 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 – 60 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months.  At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items.
Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.


11.  Discontinued Operations
On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories to Coty, Inc. (“Coty”).  The divestiture included 41 of the Company's beauty brands (“Beauty Brands”), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and a majority of the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  The form of the divestiture transaction was a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, in which P&G shareholders were given the election to exchange their P&G shares for shares of a new corporation that held the Beauty Brands (Galleria Co.), and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares.  The value P&G received in the transaction was $11.4 billion.  The value was comprised of 105 million shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for the Galleria Co. shares, valued at approximately $9.4 billion, and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt by Galleria Co.  The shares tendered

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.


in the transaction were reflected as an addition to treasury stock and the cash received related to the debt assumed by Coty was reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $5.3 billion, net of transaction and related costs.
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.  The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.The following is selected financial information underlying the Net earnings from discontinued operations for the Beauty Brands:

12.  Subsequent Event
On April 18, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA for €3.375 billion ($4.2 billion based on current exchange rates).  This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets.  We anticipate the transaction to close during fiscal year 2019, with the timing subject to regulatory clearance and customary closing conditions.
On April 5, 2018, the Company reached an agreement to dissolve our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business.  This transaction is expected to close in July 2018 and will be accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the business.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2017:•Net sales increased 3% to $50.3 billion.  Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 1%.  Organic sales increased 6% in Beauty, increased 2% in Health Care and increased 3% in Fabric & Home Care.  Organic sales decreased 4% in Grooming and decreased 2% in Baby, Feminine & Family Care.•Unit volume increased 1%, with organic volume up 2%.  Volume increased low single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Excluding the impacts of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care.•Net earnings from continuing operations were $8.0 billion, unchanged versus the prior year.  An increase in earnings before income taxes, driven primarily by sales growth and prior year charges for early debt extinguishment, was offset by an increase in taxes due primarily to the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act.•Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $2.94 due primarily to a reduction in shares outstanding caused by both cash repurchases and shares acquired as part of the prior year Beauty Brands divestiture.•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $5.3 billion or 40% versus the prior year period to $7.9 billion.  The decline was primarily due to a reduction in earnings from discontinued operations related to the base period gain from Beauty Brands divestiture.•Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings from continuing operations, excluding U.S. tax reform transitional impacts, incremental restructuring charges and the base period charge for early extinguishment of debt, increased 4% to $8.8 billion.  Core net earnings per share increased 7% to $3.28 due to the increase in core net earnings and the reduction in shares outstanding.•Operating cash flow was $10.7 billion.  Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $7.9 billion.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to adjusted net earnings, was 91%.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Global Economic Conditions.  Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs.  Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts.  We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs.  If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvement projects in 2012.  In fiscal 2016, we announced an additional multi-year cost reduction program.  This program is resulting in meaningful non-manufacturing enrollment reductions and other savings.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange.  We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Over the prior four fiscal years, the U.S. dollar had strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.Government Policies.  Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the recently enacted U.S. Tax Act, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report.  Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria and Egypt.  Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including potential increases of import tariffs.  Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2017.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2018
The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 versus the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter increased 4% to $16.3 billion including four percent positive impact from foreign exchange.  Unit volume increased 1%.  Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased 2%.  A one percent positive impact from mix, driven by disproportionate growth of Skin and Personal Care and Personal Health Care categories and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average prices, was more than offset by a negative pricing impact of two percent.  Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and was unchanged in Beauty.  Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Excluding minor brand divestitures, Fabric & Home Care organic volume increased mid-single digits.  Volume increased low single digits in developed and developing regions. Organic sales increased 1%.

Operating Costs
Gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 48.8% of net sales for the quarter.  Gross margin benefited from 230 basis points of manufacturing cost savings projects (190 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments) and 20 basis points of other benefits.  This was offset by:•a 100 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs,•a 110 basis point decline from unfavorable mix, including unfavorable product mix (primarily within segments due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products forms and club channels in certain categories), unfavorable geographic mix in certain categories and approximately 40 basis points of transportation cost hurts,•an 80 basis point decline from reduced pricing and•a 20 basis point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $4.6 billion primarily due to increases in other operating costs.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points to 28.5%.  Reductions in overhead costs and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by an increase in other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales.  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points due to productivity savings, partially offset by an increase in restructuring.  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points due to reductions in advertising spending and agency compensation and production costs.  Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points primarily due to a gain on the sale of real estate in the base period.  Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit in SG&A.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $133 million for the quarter, an increase of $37 million versus the prior year period due to increase in long term debt and in weighted average interest rates.  Interest income was $69 million for the quarter, an increase of $23 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances, available for sale investment securities balances and increase in weighted average interest rates.  Other non-operating income was $21 million, a decline of $5 million from the prior period.
Income Taxes on Continuing Operations
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 150 basis points versus the prior year period to 21.9%.  A current quarter charge of $22 million resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act caused a 70 basis point increase in the current period rate (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).  The offsetting net reduction of 220 basis points was caused by:•a 250 basis point net reduction from the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act on current period earnings,•a reduction of approximately 200 basis points from favorable geographic mix of earnings,•a 120 basis point increase from reduced excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (which totaled 60 basis points in the current year versus 180 basis points in the prior year period) and•a 110 basis point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (30 basis points in the current year versus 140 basis points in the prior year period).
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 1% to $2.5 billion for the quarter as an increase in net sales and a decrease in the effective tax rate were offset by the decrease in gross margin and increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales, all of which are discussed above.  Foreign exchange impacts had a positive effect of about $67 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $0.95.  The difference between the change in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was due to a reduction in the number of shares outstanding.
Discontinued Operations
There were no net earnings from discontinued operations in the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017.
Net Earnings
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble was unchanged at $2.5 billion for the quarter.  Diluted net earnings per share increased 2% to $0.95 due to the reduction in shares outstanding.  Core net earnings per share increased 4% to $1.00.  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the current period charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans.  The increase in core net earnings per share was driven primarily by the increase in net sales and a lower effective tax rate, driven by the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act partially offset by the decrease in operating margin.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018
The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2017.

Net Sales
Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 increased 3% to $50.3 billion including a 2% percent benefit from favorable foreign exchange impacts.  Unit volume increased 1%.  Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased 2%.  Mix had a positive impact of 1% on net sales due to the disproportionate growth of super-premium SK-II brand, Oral care power brush products and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average prices.  Reduced pricing had a negative impact of 1% on net sales.  Volume increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Grooming.  Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Excluding minor brand divestitures, Fabric and Home Care organic volume increased mid-single digits.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.  Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in developing regions.  Organic sales increased 1% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.

Operating Costs
Gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 49.9% of net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 versus the prior year period.  Gross margin benefited from 180 basis points of manufacturing cost savings projects (150 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments).  This benefit was offset by:•a 90 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs,•a 40 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix (within segments due to disproportionate growth of lower margin product forms, large sizes and club channels and between segments caused by the disproportionate volume growth in Fabric & Home Care, which has lower than company-average gross margin),•a 30 basis point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and•a 50 basis point decline from the impact of reduced pricing.Total SG&A spending increased 2% to $14.1 billion due to increases in both marketing and overhead spending.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points to 27.9%.  Reductions in marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses.  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by reductions in agency compensation and production costs.  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to productivity savings and sales growth leverage, partially offset by higher restructuring costs versus the base year period.  Other operating expenses increased 40 basis points due to gains on the sale of real estate in the base period.  Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 50 basis points of benefit in SG&A.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $370 million for the current period, an increase of $21 million versus the prior year period, due to an increase in long term debt.  Interest income was $184 million for the quarter, an increase of $61 million versus the prior year period, due to an increase in interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances and available for sale investment securities.  Other non-operating income was $189 million primarily due to gains from minor brand divestitures and other investments.  The base period had net other non-operating expenses of $450 million, due to charges for the early extinguishment of debt.
Income Taxes on Continuing Operations
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 520 basis points versus the prior year period to 27.8%.  A net transitional charge of $650 million resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act caused a 590 basis-point increase in the current period rate (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).  The remaining 70 basis point decrease in the effective rate was driven by:•a 370 basis-point reduction from the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, as the impact of the lower blended U. S. federal rate on current year earnings versus prior year was partially offset by reduced foreign tax credits versus prior year due to the inability to fully credit foreign taxes under the U.S. Tax Act,•a reduction of approximately 40 basis-points from favorable geographic mix of earnings,•a 150 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (which totaled 20 basis points in the current year versus 170 basis points in the prior year),•a 120 basis-point increase from reduced excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (60 basis points in the current year versus 180 basis points in the prior year) and•a 70 basis-point increase from the tax impacts of the prior year extinguishment of long-term debt.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations were unchanged at $8.0 billion for the period.  An increase in net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, driven primarily by increased net sales and the base period charge for early extinguishment of debt, was offset by the current period net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act.  Foreign exchange had a positive impact of about $164 million on net earnings for the year to date period, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $2.94 due primarily to a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding caused by both ongoing cash repurchases and shares acquired as part of the prior year Beauty brands divestiture.
Discontinued Operations
Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in the current period versus net earnings of $5.2 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands, which closed on October 1, 2016 (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net Earnings
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased 40% to $7.9 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2018.  The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations and the increase in income tax caused by the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act as discussed above.  Diluted net earnings per share decreased 38% to $2.94.  The difference between the decline in net earnings and the related earnings per share amounts was due to the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding.  Core net earnings per share increased 7% to $3.28.  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the current year transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act, the prior year charge for early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans.

Grooming net sales increased 2% to $1.6 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 3% increase in unit volume.  Foreign exchange had a 5% favorable impact on net sales.  Pricing had a 3% negative impact on net sales due to price reductions in Shave Care.  Negative mix reduced net sales 3% due to the disproportionate growth of lower tier products and developing regions which have lower than segment average selling prices.  Disproportionate developing market growth also contributed to the negative mix, in part, due to a higher relative proportion of disposable razors in those markets. Organic sales decreased 3%.  Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.3 points.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and mid-single digits in developing regions.•Shave Care volume increased low single digits.

Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments.  These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; and certain significant asset impairment charges.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales improved by $7 million to $143 million during the third fiscal quarter and decreased $2 million to $378 million fiscal year to date.  Corporate net earnings from continuing operations decreased $124 million to $239 million in the third fiscal quarter primarily due to the real estate gain in the base period and the current period increases in interest expense and restructuring charges, each of which has been discussed earlier in the Results of Operations section.  Fiscal year to date Corporate net earnings decreased $50 million to $161 million primarily driven by the increase in income tax expense caused by the current period charge for the transitional impacts of U.S. tax legislation, partially offset by the base period charge related to early extinguishment of debt.



Productivity and Cost Savings Plan
In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.  In 2016, the Company communicated additional multi-year productivity and cost savings targets.  In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of the productivity and cost savings targets.The additional productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses.  As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018 and 2019.  This program is expected to result in meaningful non-manufacturing enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.
Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.


LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
We generated $10.7 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $1.6 billion versus the prior year period.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, and gain on sale of assets), generated $8.3 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts generated $2.4 billion of cash in the period.  Accounts receivable used $450 million of cash due to sales growth and the timing of the quarter-end (which fell on a weekend, resulting in fewer days collection).  Inventory consumed $457 million of cash primarily due to product initiatives and business growth.  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $752 million of cash primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers, increased marketing accruals based on timing of spending and the current year impacts on taxes payable due to the U.S. Tax Act.  All other operating assets and liabilities generated $2.3 billion of cash, primarily driven by the long-term portion of the payable related to the U.S. tax reform repatriation charge.
Investing Activities
Cash used by investing activities was $3.6 billion fiscal year to date.  Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, or 5.6% of net sales.  We generated $246 million of cash from proceeds from asset sales, primarily from minor brand divestitures.  We used $3.8 billion for purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by $2.8 billion of cash generated from sales and maturities of short-term investments.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities consumed net cash of $7.5 billion fiscal year to date.  We used $5.6 billion for treasury stock purchases and $5.4 billion for dividends.  Cash generated from the net effect of debt issuances and payments was $2.4 billion.  Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $1.2 billion of cash.As of March 31, 2018, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $2.8 billion.  We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year underlying results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:Incremental Restructuring:  The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities.  Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax.  In 2012, Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities.  In 2016, the Company communicated additional multi-year productivity and cost savings targets.  This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings.  The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Transitional Impact of U.S. Tax Reform:  As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”) in December 2017.  This resulted in a net charge of $650 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.9 billion and a net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion.  The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact.  It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings.Early debt extinguishment charges:  During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $345 million after tax due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.  This charge represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.  Management does not view this charge as indicative of the Company’s operating performance or underlying business results.We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.  These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.Organic sales growth:  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, the impact from India Goods and Services Tax changes (which were effective on July 1, 2017) and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.Free cash flow:  Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending.  Free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  Management views free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment.Adjusted free cash flow productivity:  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings excluding the transitional impact of U.S. Tax Reform, which is non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying earnings or cash flow performance.  Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.Core EPS:  Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated.  Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.The condensed consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to our obligations to pay for the management and operation of certain of our wireless communications tower sites. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.On September 6, 2022, Sprint Communications LLC, a Kansas limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Sprint Communications”), Sprint LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Cogent Infrastructure, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Buyer”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Wireline Sale Agreement”), pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to acquire the U.S. long-haul fiber network and operations (including the non-U.S. extensions thereof) of Sprint Communications and its subsidiaries (the “Wireline Business”). Such transactions contemplated by the Wireline Sale Agreement are collectively referred to as the “Wireline Transaction.” On May 1, 2023, the Buyer and the Company completed the Wireline Transaction (the “Closing”). The assets and liabilities of the Wireline Business disposal group were classified as held for sale and presented within Other current assets and Other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of the Wireline Business disposal group, less costs to sell, was reassessed during each reporting period it remained classified as held for sale, and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell was reported as an adjustment included within Loss (gain) on disposal group held for sale on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Unless otherwise specified, the amounts and information presented as of December 31, 2022, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale.





Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures

In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” The standard eliminates the accounting guidance within ASC 310-40 for troubled debt restructurings by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, for public business entities, the standard requires disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. As of January 1, 2023, we have adopted this standard, and it was applied prospectively after this date. This standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

Note 2 – Business Combination

On March 9, 2023, we entered into a Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC, for a maximum purchase price of $1.35 billion to be paid out 39% in cash and 61% in shares of T-Mobile common stock. The purchase price is variable dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena Corporation during certain periods before and after closing and consists of an upfront payment at closing of the transaction, subject to certain agreed-upon adjustments, and a variable earnout payable 24 months after closing of the transaction. The upfront payment is estimated to be approximately $950 million, before working capital adjustments. The acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by the end of 2023.


Note 3 – Receivables and Related Allowance for Credit Losses

We maintain an allowance for credit losses by applying an expected credit loss model. Each period, management assesses the appropriateness of the level of allowance for credit losses by considering credit risk inherent within each portfolio segment as of the end of the period.We consider a receivable past due when a customer has not paid us by the contractually specified payment due date. Account balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible (customer default), based on factors such as customer credit ratings as well as the length of time the amounts are past due.Our portfolio of receivables is comprised of two portfolio segments: accounts receivable and equipment installment plan (“EIP”) receivables.



Accounts Receivable Portfolio Segment

Accounts receivable balances are predominately comprised of amounts currently due from customers (e.g., for wireless communications services and monthly device lease payments), device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, non-consolidated affiliates, other carriers and third-party retail channels. We estimate credit losses associated with our accounts receivable portfolio segment using an expected credit loss model, which utilizes an aging schedule methodology based on historical information and adjusted for asset-specific considerations, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our approach considers a number of factors, including our overall historical credit losses and payment experience, as well as current collection trends such as write-off frequency and severity. We also consider other qualitative factors such as current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.We consider the need to adjust our estimate of credit losses for reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions. To do so, we monitor external forecasts of changes in real U.S. gross domestic product and forecasts of consumer credit behavior for comparable credit exposures. We also periodically evaluate other macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates to assess their level of correlation with our historical credit loss statistics.




EIP Receivables Portfolio Segment

Based upon customer credit profiles at the time of customer origination, we classify the EIP receivables segment into two customer classes of “Prime” and “Subprime.” Prime customer receivables are those with lower credit risk and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher credit risk. Customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases if their assessed credit risk exceeds established underwriting thresholds. In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category may be required to pay a deposit.To determine a customer’s credit profile and assist in determining their credit class, we use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer leveraging several factors, such as credit bureau information and consumer credit risk scores, as well as service and device plan characteristics. EIP receivables had a combined weighted-average effective interest rate of 9.3% and 8.0% as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Many of our loss estimation techniques rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of our allowance for credit losses for EIP receivables. We manage our EIP receivables portfolio segment using delinquency and customer credit class as key credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the amortized cost of our EIP receivables by delinquency status, customer credit class and year of origination as of June 30, 2023:

We estimate credit losses on our EIP receivables segment by applying an expected credit loss model, which relies on historical loss data adjusted for current conditions to calculate default probabilities or an estimate for the frequency of customer default. Our assessment of default probabilities or frequency includes receivables delinquency status, historical loss experience, how long the receivables have been outstanding and customer credit ratings, as well as customer tenure. We multiply these estimated default probabilities by our estimated loss given default, which is the estimated amount of default or the severity of loss.As we do for our accounts receivable portfolio segment, we consider the need to adjust our estimate of credit losses on EIP receivables for reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions through monitoring external forecasts and periodic internal statistical analyses.


The following table presents write-offs of our EIP receivables by year of origination for the six months ended June 30, 2023:

Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures

We do not have material off-balance-sheet credit exposures as of June 30, 2023. In connection with the sales of certain service accounts receivable and EIP receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.


Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables

We regularly enter into transactions to sell certain service accounts receivable and EIP receivables. The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our condensed consolidated financial statements, are described below.

Sales of EIP Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis (the “EIP sale arrangement”), which has been revised and extended from time to time. As of both June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the EIP sale arrangement provided funding of $1.3 billion.In connection with this EIP sale arrangement, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “EIP BRE”). We consolidate the EIP BRE under the VIE model.


The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consist primarily of the deferred purchase price, included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to the EIP BRE:

Sales of Service Accounts Receivable

Overview of the Transaction

In 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis (the “service receivable sale arrangement”). On February 28, 2023, we extended the scheduled expiration date of the service receivable sale arrangement to February 27, 2024. As of both June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the service receivable sale arrangement provided funding of $775 million.

At inception, we elected to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates. As of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our deferred purchase price related to the sales of service accounts receivable and EIP receivables was $710 million and $692 million, respectively.We recognized losses from sales of receivables, including changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price, of $51 million and $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $89 million and $108 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).


Continuing Involvement

Pursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service accounts receivable and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables, are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where a write-off is imminent, and may be responsible for absorbing credit losses through reduced collections on our deferred purchase price assets. We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales. At the direction of the purchasers of the sold receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures while servicing the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers.

Note 5 – Spectrum License Transactions

The following table summarizes our spectrum license activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023:
(in millions)2023Spectrum licenses, beginning of year$95,798 Spectrum license acquisitions68 Costs to clear spectrum23 Spectrum licenses, end of period$95,889

Cash payments to acquire spectrum licenses and payments for costs to clear spectrum are included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

Spectrum Transactions

In September 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) announced that we were the winning bidder of 7,156 licenses in Auction 108 (2.5 GHz spectrum) for an aggregate price of $304 million. At inception of Auction 108 in June 2022, we deposited $65 million. We paid the FCC the remaining $239 million for the licenses won in the auction in September 2022. The aggregate cash payments made to the FCC are included in Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023, and will remain there until the corresponding licenses are received. The timing of when the licenses will be issued will be determined by the FCC after all post-auction procedures have been completed.As of June 30, 2023, the activities that are necessary to get the C-band, 3.45 GHz and 2.5 GHz spectrum, acquired pursuant to FCC Auctions 107, 110 and 108, ready for its intended use have not begun; as such, capitalization of the interest associated with the costs of deploying these spectrum licenses has not begun.


License Purchase Agreements

DISH Network Corporation

On July 1, 2020, we and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”) entered into a license purchase agreement (the “DISH License Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which DISH agreed to purchase certain 800 MHz spectrum licenses for a total of approximately $3.6 billion. The closing of the sale of spectrum under the DISH License Purchase Agreement remains subject to FCC approval. The application for FCC approval was required under the agreement to be submitted by the parties no later than June 1, 2023. As of July 27, 2023, DISH has failed to take the actions necessary to file the application as required under the DISH License Purchase Agreement; however, at the request of the Department of Justice, we have agreed not to take action to terminate the DISH License Purchase Agreement until on or about August 11, 2023. We believe the additional time is also prudent to allow the parties to determine whether an alternative arrangement is feasible, and we continue to discuss options with DISH about possible alternatives to the sale of the spectrum on the terms set forth in the DISH License Purchase Agreement. If the FCC filing is made before the agreement is terminated and the FCC subsequently approves the transaction, the parties will be required to close the agreement within five days of receiving such FCC approval.In the event we terminate the DISH License Purchase Agreement due to DISH’s breach or DISH later fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH is liable to pay us a fee of $72 million as our sole remedy; provided, however that if the transaction has not closed by April 1, 2024, other than due to the breach by a party of its terms, both parties will have the right to terminate the License Purchase Agreement and in such event no termination fee would be payable to us.Additionally, if DISH does not exercise the option to purchase the 800 MHz spectrum licenses, we are required, unless otherwise approved under the complaint and proposed final judgment agreed to by us, Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), Sprint Corporation, now known as Sprint LLC (“Sprint”), SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) and DISH with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was approved by the Court on April 1, 2020, to offer the licenses for sale through an auction. If the specified minimum price of $3.6 billion is not met in the auction, we would be relieved of the obligation to sell the licenses.



Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC

On August 8, 2022, we, Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC (together with Channel 51 License Co LLC, the
14

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
“Sellers”) entered into License Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from the Sellers in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The licenses will be acquired without any associated networks but are currently being utilized by us through exclusive leasing arrangements with the Sellers.On March 30, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we and the Sellers agreed to separate the transaction into two tranches of licenses, with the closings on the acquisitions of certain licenses in Chicago, Dallas and New Orleans (together representing $492 million of the aggregate $3.5 billion cash consideration) being deferred in order to potentially expedite the regulatory approval process for the remainder of the licenses. The licenses being acquired by us, and the total consideration being paid for the licenses, remains the same. We anticipate that the first closing will occur in late 2023 and that the second closing (on the deferred licenses) will occur in 2024.The parties have agreed that each of the closings will occur within 180 days after the receipt of the applicable required regulatory approvals, and payment of each portion of the aggregate $3.5 billion purchase price will occur no later than 40 days after the date of each respective closing.




Note 6 – Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Periodically, we use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, such as interest rate risk. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in cash flows or fair values caused by designated market risks, such as interest rate volatility. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.Cash flows associated with qualifying hedge derivative instruments are presented in the same category on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the item being hedged. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings through the same income statement line item as the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings, again, through the same income statement line item.We did not have any significant derivative instruments outstanding as of June 30, 2023, or December 31, 2022.



Interest Rate Lock Derivatives

In April 2020, we terminated our interest rate lock derivatives entered into in October 2018.Aggregate changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock derivatives, net of tax and amortization, of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion are presented in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, $55 million and $50 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, $108 million and $100 million, respectively, were amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Interest expense, net, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We expect to amortize $227 million of the Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the derivatives into Interest expense, net, over the 12 months ending June 30, 2024.



Deferred Purchase Price Assets

In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.

15

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The carrying amounts of our deferred purchase price assets, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $710 million and $692 million as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Debt

The fair value of our Senior Notes and spectrum-backed Senior Secured Notes to third parties was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore were classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our Senior Notes to affiliates was determined based on a discounted cash flow approach using market interest rates of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for our standalone credit risk. Accordingly, our Senior Notes to affiliates were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our asset-backed notes (“ABS Notes”) was primarily based on quoted prices in inactive markets for identical instruments and observable changes in market interest rates, both of which are Level 2 inputs. Accordingly, our ABS Notes were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Although we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Notes to affiliates and ABS Notes. The fair value estimates were based on information available as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange.


The carrying amounts and fair values of our short-term and long-term debt included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

Variable Interest Entities

In connection with issuing the ABS Notes in October 2022, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “ABS BRE”), and a trust (the “ABS Trust” and together with the ABS BRE, the “ABS Entities”), in which the ABS BRE holds a residual interest. The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities of the ABS Entities that most significantly impact their performance. Accordingly, we include the balances and results of operations of the ABS Entities in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Restricted Cash

Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. See Note 15 - Additional Financial Information for our reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash and cash held for sale.

Commercial Paper

Subsequent to June 30, 2023, on July 25, 2023, we established an unsecured short-term commercial paper program with the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion from time to time. This program will supplement our other available external financing arrangements, and proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As of July 27, 2023, we have not issued any amount under this program.


Note 8 – Tower Obligations

Existing CCI Tower Lease Arrangements

In 2012, we conveyed to Crown Castle International Corp. (“CCI”) the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,200 tower sites (“CCI Lease Sites”) via a master prepaid lease with site lease terms ranging from 23 to 37 years. CCI has fixed-price purchase options for the CCI Lease Sites totaling approximately $2.0 billion, exercisable annually on a per-tranche basis at the end of the lease term during the period from December 31, 2035, through December 31, 2049. If CCI exercises its purchase option for any tranche, it must purchase all the towers in the tranche. We lease back a portion of the space at certain tower sites.Assets and liabilities associated with the operation of the tower sites were transferred to special purpose entities (“SPEs”). Assets included ground lease agreements or deeds for the land on which the towers are situated, the towers themselves and existing subleasing agreements with other mobile network operator tenants that lease space at the tower sites. Liabilities included the obligation to pay ground lease rentals, property taxes and other executory costs.We determined the SPEs containing the CCI Lease Sites (“Lease Site SPEs”) are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. We have a variable interest in the Lease Site SPEs but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Lease Site SPEs’ economic performance. These activities include managing tenants and underlying ground leases, performing repair and maintenance on the towers, the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive the expected future residual returns from the purchase option to acquire the CCI Lease Sites. As we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest in the Lease Site SPEs, the Lease Site SPEs are not included on our condensed consolidated financial statements.However, we also considered if this arrangement resulted in the sale of the CCI Lease Sites for which we would derecognize the tower assets. By assessing whether control had transferred, we concluded that transfer of control criteria, as discussed in the revenue standard, were not met. Accordingly, we recorded this arrangement as a financing whereby we recorded debt, a financial obligation, and the CCI Lease Sites tower assets remained on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded long-term financial obligations in the amount of the net proceeds received and recognize interest on the tower obligations. The tower obligations are increased by interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI and through net cash flows generated and retained by CCI from the operation of the tower sites.




Acquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangements

Prior to our merger (the “Merger”) with Sprint, Sprint entered into a lease-out and leaseback arrangement with Global Signal Inc., a third party that was subsequently acquired by CCI, that conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,400 tower sites (“Master Lease Sites”) via a master prepaid lease. These agreements were assumed upon the close of the Merger, at which point the remaining term of the lease-out was approximately 17 years with no renewal options. CCI has a fixed price purchase option for all (but not less than all) of the leased or subleased sites for approximately $2.3 billion, exercisable one year prior to the expiration of the agreement and ending 120 days prior to the expiration of the agreement. We lease back a portion of the space at certain tower sites.We considered if this arrangement resulted in the sale of the Master Lease Sites for which we would derecognize the tower assets. By assessing whether control had transferred, we concluded that transfer of control criteria, as discussed in the revenue

18

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
standard, were not met. Accordingly, we recorded this arrangement as a financing whereby we recorded debt, a financial obligation, and the Master Lease Sites tower assets remained on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of the closing date of the Merger, we recognized Property and equipment with a fair value of $2.8 billion and tower obligations related to amounts owed to CCI under the leaseback of $1.1 billion. Additionally, we recognized $1.7 billion in Other long-term liabilities associated with contract terms that are unfavorable to current market rates, which include unfavorable terms associated with the fixed-price purchase option in 2037.We recognize interest expense on the tower obligations. The tower obligations are increased by the interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI. The tower assets are reported in Property and equipment, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the expected useful life of the towers, which is 20 years.



Leaseback Arrangement

On January 3, 2022, we entered into an agreement (the “Crown Agreement”) with CCI. The Crown Agreement extends the current term of the leasebacks by up to 12 years and modifies the leaseback payments for both the Existing CCI Tower Lease Arrangement and the Acquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangement. As a result of the Crown Agreement, there was an increase in our financing obligation as of the effective date of the Crown Agreement of approximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding decrease to Other long-term liabilities associated with unfavorable contract terms. The modification resulted in a revised interest rate under the effective interest method for the tower obligations: 11.6% for the Existing CCI Tower Lease Arrangement and 5.3% for the Acquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangement. There were no changes made to either of our master prepaid leases with CCI.

The following table summarizes the balances associated with both of the tower arrangements on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:
(in millions)June 30,2023December 31,2022Property and equipment, net$2,305 $2,379 Tower obligations3,860 3,934 Other long-term liabilities554 554

Future minimum payments related to the tower obligations are approximately $410 million for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, $792 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2025 and 2026, $798 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2027 and 2028, and $4.3 billion in total thereafter.We are contingently liable for future ground lease payments through the remaining term of the CCI Lease Sites and the Master Lease Sites. These contingent obligations are not included in Operating lease liabilities as any amount due is contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. Under the arrangement, we remain primarily liable for ground lease payments on approximately 900 sites and have included lease liabilities of $245 million in our Operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2023.



Note 9 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation of Revenue

We provide wireless communications services to three primary categories of customers: •Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT;•Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance; and•Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine and Mobile Virtual Network Operator customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.

Postpaid service revenues, including postpaid phone revenues and postpaid other revenues, were as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2023202220232022Postpaid service revenuesPostpaid phone revenues$10,799 $10,407 $21,451 $20,638 Postpaid other revenues1,271 1,038 2,481 2,008 Total postpaid service revenues$12,070 $11,445 $23,932 $22,646

We operate as a single operating segment. The balances presented in each revenue line item on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) represent categories of revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by type of product and service. Postpaid and prepaid service revenues also include revenues earned for providing premium services to customers, such as device insurance services. Revenue generated from the lease of mobile communication devices is included in Equipment revenues on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Contract Balances

The contract asset and contract liability balances from contracts with customers as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were as follows:
(in millions)Contract AssetsContract LiabilitiesBalance as of December 31, 2022$534 $748 Balance as of June 30, 2023665 789 Change$131 $41

Contract assets primarily represent revenue recognized for equipment sales with promotional bill credits offered to customers that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract.Contract asset balances increased primarily due to an increase in promotions with an extended service contract, partially offset by billings on existing contracts and impairment, which is recognized as bad debt expense. The current portion of our contract assets of approximately $490 million and $356 million as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, was included in Other current assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.Contract liabilities are recorded when fees are collected, or we have an unconditional right to consideration (a receivable) in advance of delivery of goods or services. Changes in contract liabilities are primarily related to the activity of prepaid customers. Contract liabilities are primarily included in Deferred revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include the following:

Remaining Performance Obligations

As of June 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining service performance obligations for postpaid contracts with subsidized devices and promotional bill credits that result in an extended service contract is $1.8 billion. We expect to recognize revenue as the service is provided on these postpaid contracts over an extended contract term of 24 months from the time of origination.Information about remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less has been excluded from the above, which primarily consists of monthly service contracts.Certain of our wholesale, roaming and service contracts include variable consideration based on usage and performance. This variable consideration has been excluded from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations. As of June 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of the contractual minimum consideration for wholesale, roaming and service contracts is $1.2 billion, $1.8 billion and $4.1 billion for 2023, 2024, and 2025 and beyond, respectively. These contracts have a remaining duration ranging from less than one year to eight years.

Contract Costs

The balance of deferred incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is included in Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred contract costs incurred to obtain postpaid service contracts are amortized over a period of 24 months. The amortization period is monitored to reflect any significant change in assumptions. Amortization of deferred contract costs included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) were $444 million and $358 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $866 million and $682 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The deferred contract cost asset is assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. There were no impairment losses recognized on deferred contract cost assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.



Note 10 – Repurchases of Common Stock

2022 Stock Repurchase Program

On September 8, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program for up to $14.0 billion of our common stock through September 30, 2023 (the “2022 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 25,183,838 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $140.00 for a total purchase price of $3.5 billion, and during the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 58,147,778 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $142.59 for a total purchase price of $8.3 billion, all of which were purchased under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. All shares purchased during the six months ended June 30, 2023, were purchased at market price. As of June 30, 2023, we had up to $2.7 billion remaining under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.

Subsequent to June 30, 2023, from July 1, 2023, through July 21, 2023, we repurchased 3,961,852 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $139.43 for a total purchase price of $552 million. As of July 21, 2023, we had up to $2.2 billion remaining under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.


Note 11 – Wireline

Sale of the Wireline Business

On September 6, 2022, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Sprint Communications and Sprint LLC, and Cogent Infrastructure, Inc. entered into the Wireline Sale Agreement, pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to acquire the Wireline Business. The Wireline Sale Agreement provided that, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Buyer agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “Purchased Interests”) of a Delaware limited liability company that holds certain assets and liabilities relating to the Wireline Business.On May 1, 2023, pursuant to the Wireline Sale Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we completed the Wireline Transaction. Under the terms of the Wireline Sale Agreement, the parties agreed to a $1 purchase price in consideration for the Purchased Interests, subject to customary adjustments, as well as payments to the Buyer pursuant to an IP transit services agreement totaling $700 million, consisting of (i) $350 million in equal monthly installments during the first year after the Closing and (ii) $350 million in equal monthly installments over the subsequent 42 months. The Buyer paid the Company $61 million at Closing. The Closing of the Wireline Transaction did not have a significant impact on the Loss (gain) on disposal group held for sale on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).The present value of the $700 million liability for fees payable for IP transit services was recognized and treated as part of the consideration exchanged with the Buyer to complete the disposal transaction, as there is a remote likelihood we will use any more than a de minimis amount of the services under the IP transit services agreement. Therefore, we concluded the cash payment obligations under the IP transit services agreement were part of the consideration paid to the Buyer to facilitate the sale of the Wireline Business, and therefore, included in measuring the fair value less costs to sell of the Wireline Business disposal group. As of June 30, 2023, $308 million and $295 million of this liability, including accrued interest, is presented within Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with the expected timing of the related payments. As of June 30, 2023, $40 million and $31 million for contractual and other payments associated with the Wireline Transaction are presented within Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with the expected timing of the related payments.



21

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $25 million, which is included within Loss (gain) on disposal group held for sale on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). This gain was primarily due to a decrease in our accrual of estimated costs to sell.We do not consider the sale of the Wireline Business to be a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results, and therefore the Wireline Business did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation.


2022 Wireline Impairment

During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we determined that the retirement of the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE wireless networks triggered the need to assess the Wireline long-lived assets for impairment, as these assets no longer support our wireless network and the associated customers and cash flows in a significant manner. The results of this assessment indicated that certain Wireline long-lived assets were impaired, and as a result, we recorded noncash impairment expense of $477 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022, of which $258 million was related to Wireline Property and equipment, $212 million was related to Operating lease right-of-use assets and $7 million was related to Other intangible assets. The expense is included within Impairment expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). There was no impairment expense recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.


Note 12 – Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share was as follows:

As of June 30, 2023, we had authorized 100 million shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.00001 per share. There was no preferred stock outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. Potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if to do so would have been anti-dilutive.

The SoftBank Specified Shares Amount of 48,751,557 shares of T-Mobile common stock was determined to be contingent consideration for the Merger and is not dilutive until the defined volume-weighted average price per share is reached.


Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Commitments

We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2038. In addition, we have commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043.Our purchase commitments are approximately $4.2 billion for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, $4.7 billion in total for both of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2025 and 2026, $2.8 billion in total for both of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2027 and 2028, and $2.5 billion in total thereafter. These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases

22

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. On March 9, 2023, we entered into a Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC, for a maximum purchase price of $1.35 billion to be paid out 39% in cash and 61% in shares of T-Mobile common stock. The upfront payment is estimated to be approximately $950 million, before working capital adjustments. The agreement remains subject to regulatory approval and the estimated purchase price is excluded from our reported purchase commitments above. See Note 2 – Business Combination for additional details.


Spectrum Leases

We lease spectrum from various parties. These leases include service obligations to the lessors. Certain spectrum leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional charges, renewal options and escalation clauses. Leased spectrum agreements have varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2050. We expect that all renewal periods in our spectrum leases will be exercised by us. Certain spectrum leases also include purchase options and right-of-first refusal clauses in which we are provided the opportunity to exercise our purchase option if the lessor receives a purchase offer from a third party. The purchase of the leased spectrum is at our option and therefore the option price is not included in the commitments below.Our spectrum lease and service credit commitments, including renewal periods, are approximately $310 million for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, $595 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2025 and 2026, $658 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2027 and 2028, and $4.5 billion in total thereafter.On August 8, 2022, we entered into License Purchase Agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The licenses will be acquired without any associated networks but are currently being utilized by us through exclusive leasing arrangements with the Sellers. On March 30, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we and the Sellers agreed to separate the transaction into two tranches of licenses, with the closings on the acquisitions of certain licenses in Chicago, Dallas and New Orleans (together representing $492 million of the aggregate $3.5 billion cash consideration) being deferred in order to potentially expedite the regulatory approval process for the remainder of the licenses. The agreements remain subject to regulatory approval and are excluded from our reported purchase commitments above. See Note 5 – Spectrum License Transactions for additional details.



Contingencies and Litigation

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (“Litigation and Regulatory Matters”) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC or other government agency rules and regulations. Those Litigation and Regulatory Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate. The accruals are reflected on our condensed consolidated financial statements, but they are not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. For Litigation and Regulatory Matters that may result in a contingent gain, we recognize such gains on our condensed consolidated financial statements when the gain is realized or realizable. We recognize legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with Litigation and Regulatory Matters as they are incurred. Except as otherwise specified below, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation and Regulatory Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below or other matters that we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.

On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. In the first quarter of 2020, we recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount. We maintained the accrual as of June 30, 2023, and that accrual was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings. These matters include, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint’s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments.We note that pursuant to Amendment No. 2, dated as of February 20, 2020, to the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018, by and among the Company, Sprint and the other parties named therein (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”), SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including those relating to the Lifeline matters described above. Resolution of these matters could require us to make additional reimbursements and pay additional fines and penalties, which we do not expect to have a significant impact on our financial results. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank.On June 1, 2021, a putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Dinkevich v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al., Case No. C.A. No. 2021-0479, against DT, SoftBank and certain of our current and former officers and directors, asserting breach of fiduciary duty claims relating to the repricing amendment to the Business Combination Agreement, and to SoftBank’s monetization of its T-Mobile shares. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the case. We are unable to predict the potential outcome of these claims.On August 12, 2021, we became aware of a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile’s systems (the “August 2021 cyberattack”). We immediately began an investigation and engaged cybersecurity experts to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data was impacted. Our investigation uncovered that the perpetrator had illegally gained access to certain areas of our systems on or about March 18, 2021, but only gained access to and took data of current, former, and prospective customers beginning on or about August 3, 2021. With the assistance of our outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We also undertook a number of other measures to demonstrate our continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection. We also coordinated with law enforcement. Our forensic investigation is complete, and we believe we have a full view of the data compromised.As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we have become subject to numerous lawsuits, including mass arbitration claims and multiple class action lawsuits that have been filed in numerous jurisdictions seeking, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack. In December 2021, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the federal class action lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri under the caption In re: T-Mobile Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, Case No. 21-md-3019-BCW. On July 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit. On June 29, 2023, the Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement, which is subject to potential appeals. Under the terms of the settlement, we would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs’ counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. We would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. We previously paid $35 million for claims administration purposes. We expect the remaining portion of the $350 million settlement payment to fund claims to be made by August 29, 2023, unless settlement is delayed by potential appeals. We anticipate that, upon exhaustion of any appeals, the settlement will provide a full release of all claims arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack by class members who do not opt out, against all defendants, including us, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our directors and officers. The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants. We have the right to terminate the settlement agreement under certain conditions.We anticipate that this settlement of the class action, along with other settlements of separate consumer claims that have been previously completed or are currently pending, will resolve substantially all of the claims brought to date by our current, former and prospective customers who were impacted by the 2021 cyberattack. In connection with the proposed class action settlement and the separate settlements, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million in the second quarter of 2022.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized $50 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack, which is included as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The ultimate resolution of the class action depends on the number of plaintiffs who opt-out of the proposed settlement and whether the proposed settlement will be appealed.In addition, in September 2022, a purported Company shareholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Chancery Court under the caption Harper v. Sievert et al., Case No. 2022-0819-SG, against our current directors and certain of our former directors, alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the Company’s cybersecurity practices. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the lawsuit. We are unable at this time to predict the potential outcome of this lawsuit or whether we may be subject to further private litigation. We have also received inquiries from various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities related to the August 2021 cyberattack which could result in substantial fines or penalties. We are cooperating fully with these agencies and regulators and working with them to resolve these matters. While we hope to resolve them in the near term, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these matters, or whether we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions.In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters and based on the information currently available to us, in addition to the previously recorded pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million noted above, we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Ongoing legal and other costs related to these proceedings and inquiries, as well as any potential future actions, may be substantial, and losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries could be material to our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.On June 17, 2022, plaintiffs filed a putative antitrust class action complaint in the Northern District of Illinois, Dale et al. v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-03189, against DT, T-Mobile, and SoftBank, alleging that the Merger violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition in the U.S. retail cell service market. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and trebled monetary damages on behalf of a purported class of AT&T and Verizon customers who plaintiffs allege paid artificially inflated prices due to the Merger. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, but we are unable to predict the potential outcome.On January 5, 2023, we identified that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single Application Programming Interface (“API”) without authorization. Based on our investigation, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.In connection with the January 2023 cyberattack, we became subject to consumer class actions and regulatory inquires, to which we will continue to respond in due course and may incur significant expenses. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether we may be subject to additional legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. In addition, we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers’ behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, although we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on our operations.








Note 14 – Restructuring Costs

Upon close of the Merger in April 2020, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies and reduce redundancies. The major activities associated with the Merger restructuring initiatives to date include contract termination costs associated with the rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements, severance costs associated with the integration of redundant processes and functions and the decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve Merger synergies in network costs.

Note 16 – Subsequent Events

Subsequent to June 30, 2023, from July 1, 2023, through July 21, 2023, we repurchased 3,961,852 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $139.43 for a total purchase price of $552 million. See Note 10 – Repurchases of Common Stock for additional information.

Subsequent to June 30, 2023, on July 25, 2023, we established an unsecured short-term commercial paper program with the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion from time to time. This program will supplement our other available external financing arrangements, and proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As of July 27, 2023, we have not issued any amount under this program.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) of T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including information concerning our future results of operations, are forward-looking statements.

Sprint Merger, Network Integration and Decommissioning Activities

Merger-Related Costs

Merger-related costs associated with the Merger and acquisitions of affiliates generally include:•Integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations, migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing systems and the impact of legal matters assumed as part of the Merger;•Restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and•Transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the transactions.Restructuring costs are disclosed below under “Restructuring” and in Note 14 – Restructuring Costs of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A. Net cash payments for Merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



Merger-related costs are presented below:

We expect to incur substantially all of the remaining projected Merger-related costs of approximately $400 million, excluding capital expenditures, by the end of 2023, with the cash expenditure for the Merger-related costs extending beyond 2023.We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. We expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives.


Restructuring

Upon the close of the Merger in April 2020, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. The major activities associated with the Merger restructuring initiatives to date include:•Contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;•Severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and•The decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve Merger synergies in network costs.


For more information regarding our Merger restructuring activities, see Note 14 – Restructuring Costs of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Anticipated Merger Synergies

As a result of our ongoing restructuring and integration activities, we have realized Merger synergies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes and operations (see “Restructuring” above). For full-year 2023, we expect Merger synergies from Selling, general and administrative expense reductions of approximately $2.7 billion, Cost of service expense reductions of approximately $3.2 billion and avoided network expenses of approximately $1.6 billion.

Wireline

On September 6, 2022, we entered into the Wireline Sale Agreement to sell the Wireline Business for a total purchase price of $1 and the payments totaling $700 million under the IP transit services agreement. On May 1, 2023, pursuant to the Wireline Sale Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we completed the Wireline Transaction.

For more information regarding the Wireline Sale Agreement, see Note 11 – Wireline of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisition of Ka’ena Corporation

On March 9, 2023, we entered into a Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC, for a maximum purchase price of $1.35 billion to be paid out 39% in cash and 61% in shares of T-Mobile common stock. The purchase price is variable dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena Corporation during certain periods before and after closing and consists of an upfront payment at closing of the transaction, subject to certain agreed-upon adjustments, and a variable earnout payable 24 months after closing of the transaction. The upfront payment is estimated to be approximately $950 million, before working capital adjustments. The acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by the end of 2023.Ka’ena Corporation is currently one of our wholesale partners, offering wireless telecommunications services to customers leveraging our network. Upon closing of the transactions, we expect to recognize customers of Ka’ena Corporation as prepaid customers and expect to see an increase in Prepaid revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale revenues.


Recent Cyberattacks

In August 2021, we were subject to a criminal cyberattack involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile’s systems. As a result of the attack, we are subject to numerous arbitration demands and lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory inquiries as described in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized $50 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack. We are pursuing additional reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack.In January 2023, we disclosed that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single Application Programming Interface (“API”) without authorization. Based on our investigation, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.We will continue to respond to litigation and regulatory inquiries in connection with this incident and may incur significant expenses. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether we may be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. In addition, we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers’ behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, although we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on our operations.In response to the recent cyberattacks and increasing cybersecurity threats, we have significantly increased our focus on enhancing our cybersecurity practices with a substantial multi-year investment. In the second quarter of 2023, we have hired new security leadership, and implemented significant technology improvements to our cybersecurity controls. Those improvements include additional authentication measures and internal systems limitations and restrictions. In addition, we have enhanced our cybersecurity awareness program, including rolling out new training for all employees. While we have made progress to date, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to strengthen our cybersecurity program in future periods.

Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the Senior Notes to affiliates and third parties issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc., Sprint and Sprint Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Issuers”) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of Parent’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. Generally, the guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries with respect to the Senior Notes issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. (other than $3.5 billion in principal amount of Senior Notes issued in 2017 and 2018) and the credit agreement entered into by T-Mobile USA, Inc. will be automatically and unconditionally released if, immediately following such release and any concurrent releases of other guarantees, the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than certain specified subsidiaries) would not exceed $2.0 billion. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets.

Performance Measures

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our condensed consolidated financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

Postpaid Accounts

A postpaid account is generally defined as a billing account number that generates revenue. Postpaid accounts generally consist of customers that are qualified for postpaid service utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT, where they generally pay after receiving service.The following table sets forth the number of ending postpaid accounts:

Customers

A customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Customers are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance of receiving service.

Churn

Churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently had their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

The following table sets forth the churn:

Postpaid phone churn decreased 3 basis points for the three months ended and decreased 3 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily from improved customer retention driven by a differentiated value proposition and network experience.Prepaid churn increased 4 basis points for the three months ended and increased 7 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily from continued industry migration of prepaid to postpaid.


Postpaid Average Revenue Per Account

Postpaid Average Revenue per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. Postpaid ARPA is calculated as Postpaid revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid accounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT.

Average Revenue Per User

Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned per customer. ARPU is calculated as service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices, including tablets and hotspots, wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices, including SyncUP and IoT.The following table sets forth our operating measure ARPU:

Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We historically used Adjusted EBITDA and we currently use Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs, including network decommissioning costs, impairment expense, gain on disposal groups held for sale and certain legal-related recoveries and expenses, as well as other special income and expenses which are not reflective of our core business activities. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the Company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of June 30, 2023, our Cash and cash equivalents were $6.6 billion compared to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2022.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for Purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions and less Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares and provide further investment in the business. Starting in the first quarter of 2023, we renamed Free Cash Flow to Adjusted Free Cash Flow. This change in name did not result in any change to the definition or calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Service Revenues. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin is utilized by management, investors, and analysts to evaluate the company’s ability to convert service revenue efficiently into cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares and provide further investment in the business.The table below provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily impacted by the following:•Lower Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, driven by increased capital efficiencies from accelerated investments in our nationwide 5G network in 2022; •Higher Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which were offset in Net cash provided by operating activities; and•Higher Net cash provided by operating activities, as described above.•Adjusted Free Cash Flow includes the impact of $728 million and $907 million in net payments for Merger-related costs for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily impacted by the following:•Lower Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, driven by increased capital efficiencies from accelerated investments in our nationwide 5G network in 2022; •Higher Net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and•Higher Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which were offset in Net cash provided by operating activities. •Adjusted Free Cash Flow includes the impact of $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion in net payments for Merger-related costs for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant net cash proceeds from securitization.







Borrowing Capacity

We maintain a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with an aggregate commitment amount of $7.5 billion. As of June 30, 2023, there was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, on July 25, 2023, we established an unsecured short-term commercial paper program with the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion from time to time. This program will supplement our other available external financing arrangements and proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As of July 27, 2023, we have not issued any amount under this program.

Debt Financing

As of June 30, 2023, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $80.3 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $70.1 billion was classified as long-term debt and $1.3 billion was classified as long-term financing lease liabilities.During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we issued long-term debt for net proceeds of $6.5 billion and repaid short-term debt with an aggregate principal amount of $354 million.


For more information regarding our debt financing transactions, see Note 7 - Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

License Purchase Agreements

On August 8, 2022, we entered into License Purchase Agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. On March 30, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we and the Sellers agreed to bifurcate the transaction into two tranches of licenses, with the closings on the acquisitions of certain licenses in Chicago, Dallas and New Orleans (together representing $492 million of the aggregate $3.5 billion cash consideration) being deferred in order to potentially expedite the regulatory approval process for the remainder of the licenses. We anticipate that the first closing will occur in late 2023 and that the second closing (on the deferred licenses) will occur in 2024.The parties have agreed that each of the closings will occur within 180 days after the receipt of the applicable required regulatory approvals, and payment of each portion of the aggregate $3.5 billion purchase price will occur no later than 40 days after the date of each respective closing.


For more information regarding our License Purchase Agreements, see Note 5 – Spectrum License Transactions of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisition of Ka’ena Corporation

On March 9, 2023, we entered into a Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC for a maximum purchase price of $1.35 billion to be paid out 39% in cash and 61% in shares of T-Mobile common stock. The purchase price is variable dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena Corporation during certain periods before and after closing and consists of an upfront payment at closing of the transaction, subject to certain agreed-upon adjustments, and a variable earnout payable 24 months after closing of the transaction. The upfront payment is estimated to be approximately $950 million, before working capital adjustments. The acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by the end of 2023.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of June 30, 2023, we derecognized net receivables of $2.4 billion upon sale through these arrangements.

For more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity

We may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional debt, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other long-lived assets in private party transactions, repurchase shares, or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for acquisitions of businesses, spectrum and other long-lived assets or for any potential stockholder returns, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of debt, tower obligations, share repurchases and the execution of our integration plan. We determine future liquidity requirements for operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum or repurchase shares. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses to comply with the Government Commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantially all of the remaining projected Merger-related costs of approximately $400 million, excluding capital expenditures, by the end of 2023, with the cash expenditure for the Merger-related costs extending beyond 2023. While we have assumed that a certain level of Merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of June 30, 2023.

Financing Lease Facilities

We have uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain third parties that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of June 30, 2023, we have entered into $8.1 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $314 million and $552 million was executed during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. We expect to enter into up to a total of $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2023.

Capital Expenditures

Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel and customer base of T-Mobile and Sprint. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our network and spectrum licenses, including acquired Sprint PCS and 2.5 GHz spectrum licenses, as we build out our nationwide 5G network. We expect a reduction in capital expenditures related to these efforts in 2023 compared to 2022. Future capital expenditure requirements will include the deployment of our recently acquired C-band and 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses.

For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 5 – Spectrum License Transactions of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stockholder Returns

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. However, we continue to evaluate alternatives for returning value to stockholders, and we could elect to declare dividends in the future.On September 8, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized our 2022 Stock Repurchase Program for up to $14.0 billion of our common stock through September 30, 2023. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $3.5 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, all of which were purchased under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 30, 2023, we had up to $2.7 billion remaining under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.Subsequent to June 30, 2023, from July 1, 2023, through July 21, 2023, we repurchased additional shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $552 million. As of July 21, 2023, we had up to $2.2 billion remaining under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.



For additional information regarding the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program, see Note 10 – Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Related Party Transactions

We have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.As of July 21, 2023, DT held, directly or indirectly, approximately 51.4% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 48.6% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by SoftBank and other stockholders. As a result of the Proxy, Lock-Up and ROFR Agreement, dated April 1, 2020, by and between DT and SoftBank and the Proxy, Lock-Up and ROFR Agreement, dated June 22, 2020, by and among DT, Claure Mobile LLC, and Marcelo Claure, DT has voting control, as of July 21, 2023, over approximately 55.2% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock.


Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act

Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and the Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act. Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the three months ended June 30, 2023, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with either DT or SoftBank. We have relied upon DT and SoftBank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to five customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank, CPG Engineering & Commercial Services GmbH, Golgohar Trade and Technology GmbH and International Trade and Industrial Technology ITRITEC GmbH. With respect to the first four of these customers, the services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. DT is currently evaluating the relationship its non-U.S. subsidiary has with International Trade and Technology ITRITEC GmbH. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the three months ended June 30, 2023, were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.Separately, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provides roaming services in Iran through Irancell Telecommunications Services Company. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, SoftBank had no gross revenues from such services and no net profit was generated. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such services. This subsidiary also provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to accounts affiliated with the Embassy of Iran in Japan. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, SoftBank estimates that gross revenues and net profit generated by such services were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary is obligated under contract and intends to continue such services.In addition, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. indirect subsidiaries, provides office supplies to the Embassy of Iran in Japan. SoftBank estimates that gross revenue and net profit generated by such services during the three months ended June 30, 2023, were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such activities.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls include the use of a Disclosure Committee which is comprised of representatives from our Accounting, Legal, Treasury, Technology, Risk Management, Government Affairs and Investor Relations functions and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Other than the updated risk factor below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

We have experienced criminal cyberattacks and could in the future be further harmed by disruption, data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly through third parties whose products and services we rely on in operating our business.

Our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our customers, such as sensitive personal, account and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions, financial information, and intellectual property (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Additionally, to offer services to our customers and operate our business, we utilize a number of products and services, such as IT networks and systems, including those we own and operate as well as others provided by third-party providers, such as cloud services (collectively, “Systems”). We are subject to persistent cyberattacks and threats to our business from a variety of bad actors, many of whom attempt to gain unauthorized access to and compromise Confidential Information and Systems. In some cases, the bad actors exploit bugs, errors, misconfigurations or other vulnerabilities in our Systems to obtain Confidential Information. In other cases, these bad actors may obtain unauthorized access to Confidential Information utilizing credentials taken from our customers, employees, or third-party providers through credential harvesting, social engineering or other means. Other bad actors aim to cause serious operational disruptions to our business and Systems through ransomware or distributed denial of services attacks.Cyberattacks against companies like ours have increased in frequency and potential harm over time, and the methods used to gain unauthorized access constantly evolve, making it increasingly difficult to anticipate, prevent, and/or detect incidents successfully in every instance. They are perpetrated by a variety of groups and persons, including state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, employees, contractors, or other unrelated third parties. Some of these persons reside in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.In addition, we routinely rely upon third-party providers whose products and services are used in our business. These third-party providers have experienced in the past, and will continue to experience in the future, cyberattacks that involve attempts to obtain unauthorized access to our Confidential Information and/or to create operational disruptions that could adversely affect our business, and these providers also face other security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information.In August 2021, we disclosed that our systems were subject to a criminal cyberattack that compromised certain data of millions of our current customers, former customers, and prospective customers, including, in some instances, social security numbers, names, addresses, dates of birth and driver’s license/identification numbers. With the assistance of outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former, and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We have incurred certain cyberattack-related expenses, including costs to remediate the attack, provide additional customer support and enhance customer protection, and expect to incur additional expense in future periods resulting from the attack. For more information, see “Recent Cyberattacks” in the Overview section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, the ongoing costs of which may be material, and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries and private litigation. For more information, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2023, we disclosed that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single Application Programming Interface (“API”) without authorization. Based on our investigation, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack and the January 2023 cyberattack, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs or experience other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber liability insurance, and such costs and impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.In addition to the recent cyberattacks, we have experienced other unrelated immaterial incidents involving unauthorized access to certain Confidential Information. Typically, these incidents have involved attempts to commit fraud by taking control of a customer’s phone line, often by using compromised credentials. In other cases, the incidents have involved unauthorized access to certain of our customers’ private information, including credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords, and to certain of our intellectual property. Some of these incidents have occurred at third-party providers, including third parties who provide us with various Systems and others who sell our products and services through retail locations or take care of our customers.Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to Confidential Information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt our operations must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulations. These preventative actions require the investment of significant resources and management time and attention. Additionally, we do not have control of the cybersecurity systems, breach prevention, and response protocols of our third-party providers. While T-Mobile may have contractual rights to assess the effectiveness of many of our providers’ systems and protocols, we do not have the means to know or assess the effectiveness of all of our providers’ systems and controls at all times. We cannot provide any assurances that actions taken by us, or our third-party providers, will adequately repel a significant cyberattack or prevent or substantially mitigate the impacts of cybersecurity breaches or misuses of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to our networks or systems or exploits against third-party environments, or that we, or our third-party providers, will be able to effectively identify, investigate, and remediate such incidents in a timely manner or at all. We expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, given the nature of our business, and we expect the same with respect to our third-party providers. We also expect that threat actors will continue to gain sophistication including in the use of tools and techniques (such as artificial intelligence) that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls, evade detection, and obfuscate forensic evidence, making it more challenging for us to identify, investigate and recover from future cyberattacks in a timely and effective manner. If we fail to protect Confidential Information or to prevent operational disruptions from future cyberattacks, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.

Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.

We and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings, mass arbitrations and litigation matters. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel.In connection with the Transactions, we became subject to a number of legal proceedings, including a putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit and a putative antitrust class action. For more information, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible that stockholders of T-Mobile and/or Sprint may file additional putative class action lawsuits or shareholder derivative actions against the Company and the legacy T-Mobile board of directors and/or the legacy Sprint board of directors. Among other remedies, these stockholders could seek damages. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and any such potential lawsuits could result in substantial costs and may be costly and distracting to management.Additionally, on April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions and other proceedings. Unfavorable resolution of these matters could require us to make additional reimbursements and pay additional fines and penalties.On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating Section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of March 31, 2020, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we are subject to numerous lawsuits, including consolidated class action lawsuits seeking unspecified monetary damages, mass consumer arbitrations, a shareholder derivative lawsuit and inquiries by various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities, and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries and private litigation. We are cooperating fully with regulators and vigorously defending against the class actions and other lawsuits. On July 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit. On June 29, 2023, the Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement, which is subject to potential appeals. Under the terms of the settlement, we would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs’ counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. We would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. In connection with the class action settlement and other settlements of separate consumer claims that have been previously completed or are currently pending, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters and based on the information currently available to us, we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, in connection with the January 2023 cyberattack, we have received notices of consumer class actions and regulatory inquires, to which we will continue to respond in due course. Ongoing legal and other costs related to these proceedings and inquiries, as well as any potential future proceedings and inquiries related to the August 2021 cyberattack and the January 2023 cyberattack, may be substantial, and losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries could be significant and have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.We, along with equipment manufacturers and other carriers, are subject to current and potential future lawsuits alleging adverse health effects arising from the use of wireless handsets or from wireless transmission equipment such as cell towers. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless device emissions, and its assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices may evolve based on its findings. Any of these allegations or changes in risk assessments could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, could result in significant legal and regulatory liability, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 – Basis of Presentation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.The condensed consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (“VIE”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations (Tower obligations are included in VIEs related to the 2012 Tower Transaction. See Note 8 - Tower Obligations included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.



Change in Accounting Principle

Effective January 1, 2017, the imputed discount on Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”) receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method, and was previously presented within Interest income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is now presented within Other revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from our major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. We have applied this change retrospectively and presented the effect on the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, in the tables below:

The change in accounting principle did not have an impact on basic or diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, or Accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”), and has since modified the standard with several ASUs. The standard is effective for us, and we will adopt the standard, on January 1, 2018.The standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.The guidance permits two methods of adoption, the full retrospective method applying the standard to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. The standard also allows entities to apply certain practical expedients at their discretion. We are adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative catch up adjustment and will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous GAAP.We currently anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant potential impacts include the following items:•Whether our EIP contracts contain a significant financing component, which is similar to our current practice of imputing interest, and would similarly impact the amount of revenue recognized at the time of an EIP sale and whether or not a portion of the revenue is recognized as interest and included in other revenues, rather than equipment revenues. We currently expect to recognize the financing component in our EIP contracts, including those financing components that are not considered to be significant to the contract. We believe that this application will be consistent with our current practice of imputing interest.•As we currently expense contract acquisition costs, we believe that the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contracts to which the costs relate will have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. We plan to utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less which we expect will typically result in expensing commissions paid to acquire branded prepaid service contracts. Currently, we believe that incremental contract acquisition costs of approximately $450 million to $550 million that were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, which consists primarily of commissions paid to acquire branded postpaid service contracts, would require capitalization and amortization under the new standard. We expect that deferred contract costs will have an average amortization period of approximately 24 months, subject to being monitored and updated every period to reflect any significant change in assumptions. In addition, the deferred contract cost asset will be assessed for impairment on a periodic basis.•We expect that promotional bill credits offered to customers on equipment sales that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract will result in extended service contracts, which impacts the allocation and timing of revenue recognition between service revenue and equipment revenue.•Overall, with the exception of the aforementioned impacts, we do not expect that the new standard will result in a substantive change to the method of allocation of contract revenues between various services and equipment, nor to the timing of when revenues are recognized for most of our service contracts.We are still in the process of evaluating these impacts, and our initial assessment may change due to changes in the terms and mix of the contractual arrangements we have with customers. New products or offerings, or changes to current offerings may yield significantly different impacts than currently expected.We are in the process of implementing significant new revenue accounting systems, processes and internal controls over revenue recognition which will assist us in the application of the new standard.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The standard requires all lessees to report a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most leases. The income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification. The standard requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting. For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. We are currently evaluating the standard, which will require recognizing and measuring leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2019, and expect the adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities that have not previously been recorded, which will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.We are in the process of implementing significant new lease accounting systems, processes and internal controls over lease recognition which will ultimately assist in the application of the new standard.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, and will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). Early adoption is permitted for us as of January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” The standard is intended to reduce current diversity in practice and provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for us, and we will adopt the standard, on January 1, 2018. The standard will require a retrospective approach. The standard will impact the presentation of cash flows related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, and $2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The standard will also impact the presentation of cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $188 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. We had no cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs for the three months ended September 30, 2017.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The standard requires that the income tax impact of intra-entity sales and transfers of property, except for inventory, be recognized when the transfer occurs. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, and will require any deferred taxes not yet recognized on intra-entity transfers to be recorded to retained earnings under a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” The standard requires entities to include in their cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. The ASU does not define the terms “restricted cash” and “restricted cash equivalents.” The standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, and will require a retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” The standard eliminates the requirement to measure the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all assets and liabilities within that unit (“the Step 2 test”) from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, and must be applied to any annual or interim goodwill impairment assessments after that date. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard and timing of adoption, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 – Significant Transactions

Hurricane Impacts

During the third quarter of 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes. Based on our preliminary assessment, the negative impact to operating income and net income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, from lost revenue, assets damaged or destroyed and other hurricane related costs incurred was $148 million and $90 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, our loss assessment is ongoing and we expect additional expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be impacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily related to our operations in Puerto Rico. We have not recognized any potential insurance recoveries related to those hurricane losses as we continue to assess the damage and work with our insurance carriers.

Purchase of Iowa Wireless

On September 18, 2017, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (“UPA”) to acquire the remaining equity in INS Wireless, Inc. (“INS”), a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million. We account for our existing investment in INS under the equity method as we have significant influence, but not control. Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected within the next six months, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, INS will become a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary.

Spectrum Transactions

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we entered into agreements with third parties for the exchange of certain spectrum licenses and were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction. See Note 5 - Spectrum License Transactions for further information.

Debt

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we completed significant transactions with both third parties and affiliates related to the issuance, borrowing and redemption of debt. See Note 7 - Debt for further information.

Power Purchase Agreements

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we entered into two renewable energy purchase agreements with third parties. These agreements each consist of two components, an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility and a commitment to purchase the energy credits associated with the energy output generated by the facility. See Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies for further information.

We use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer at the time of application for mobile communications service using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores and service plan characteristics. Based upon customer credit profiles, we classify EIP receivables into the credit categories of “Prime” and “Subprime.” Prime customer receivables are those with lower delinquency risk and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher delinquency risk. Subprime customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases. In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category are required to pay an advance deposit.EIP receivables for which invoices have not yet been generated for the customer are classified as Unbilled. EIP receivables for which invoices have been generated but which are not past the contractual due date are classified as Billed – Current. EIP receivables for which invoices have been generated and the payment is past the contractual due date are classified as Billed – Past Due.The balance and aging of the EIP receivables on a gross basis by credit category were as follows:

Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables

We have entered into transactions to sell certain service and EIP accounts receivables. The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our financial statements, are described below.

Sales of Service Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivables on a revolving basis and in November 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million (the “service receivable sale arrangement”) and extend the scheduled expiration date to March 2018. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the service receivable sale arrangement provided funding of $899 million and $907 million, respectively. Sales of receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. The receivables consist of service charges currently due from customers and are short-term in nature.In connection with the service receivable sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity to sell service accounts receivables (the “Service BRE”). The Service BRE does not qualify as a VIE, and due to the significant level of control we exercise over the entity, it is consolidated. Pursuant to the arrangement, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries transfer selected receivables to the Service BRE. The Service BRE then sells the receivables to an unaffiliated entity (the “Service VIE”), which was established to facilitate the sale of beneficial ownership interests in the receivables to certain third parties.

Variable Interest Entity

We determined that the Service VIE qualifies as a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities. We have a variable interest in the Service VIE, but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Service VIE’s economic performance. Those activities include committing the Service VIE to legal agreements to purchase or sell assets, selecting which receivables are purchased in the service receivable sale arrangement, determining whether the Service VIE will sell interests in the purchased service receivables to other parties, funding of the entity and servicing of receivables. We do not hold the power to direct the key decisions underlying these activities. For example, while we act as the servicer of the sold receivables, which is considered a significant activity of the Service VIE, we are acting as an agent in our capacity as the servicer and the counterparty to the service receivable sale arrangement has the ability to remove us as the servicing agent of the receivables at will with no recourse available to us. As we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, the results of the Service VIE are not consolidated into our condensed consolidated financial statements.The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consists primarily of the deferred purchase price and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to our variable interest in the Service VIE:

(in millions)September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Other current assets$225 $207Accounts payable and accrued liabilities13 17Other current liabilities155 129

Sales of EIP Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivables on a revolving basis and in August 2017, the EIP sale arrangement was amended to reduce the maximum funding commitment to $1.2 billion (the “EIP sale arrangement”) and extend the scheduled expiration date to November 2018. As of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the EIP sale arrangement provided funding of $1.2 billion. Sales of EIP receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. The receivables consist of customer EIP balances, which require monthly customer payments for up to 24 months.In connection with this EIP sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “EIP BRE”). Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, our wholly-owned subsidiary transfers selected receivables to the EIP BRE. The EIP BRE then sells the receivables to a non-consolidated and unaffiliated third-party entity for which we do not exercise any level of control, nor does the entity qualify as a VIE.


Variable Interest Entity

We determined that the EIP BRE is a VIE as its equity investment at risk lacks the obligation to absorb a certain portion of its expected losses. We have a variable interest in the EIP BRE and determined that we are the primary beneficiary based on our ability to direct the activities which most significantly impact the EIP BRE’s economic performance. Those activities include selecting which receivables are transferred into the EIP BRE and sold in the EIP sale arrangement and funding of the EIP BRE. Additionally, our equity interest in the EIP BRE obligates us to absorb losses and gives us the right to receive benefits from the EIP BRE that could potentially be significant to the EIP BRE. Accordingly, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary, and include the balances and results of operations of the EIP BRE in our condensed consolidated financial statements.The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consists primarily of the deferred purchase price and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to the EIP BRE:

(in millions)September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Other current assets$357 $371Other assets90 83Other long-term liabilities2 4

In addition, the EIP BRE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to any liquidation of the EIP BRE, to be satisfied prior to any value in the EIP BRE becoming available to us. Accordingly, the assets of the EIP BRE may not be used to settle our general obligations and creditors of the EIP BRE have limited recourse to our general credit.

Sales of Receivables

The transfers of service receivables and EIP receivables to the non-consolidated entities are accounted for as sales of financial assets. Once identified for sale, the receivable is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Upon sale, we derecognize the net carrying amount of the receivables. We recognize the net cash proceeds in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The proceeds are net of the deferred purchase price, consisting of a receivable from the purchasers that entitles us to certain collections on the receivables. We recognize the collection of the deferred purchase price in Net cash provided by operating activities as it is dependent on collection of the customer receivables and is not subject to significant interest rate risk. The deferred purchase price represents a financial asset that is primarily tied to the creditworthiness of the customers and which can be settled in such a way that we may not recover substantially all of our recorded investment, due to default by the customers on the underlying receivables. We elected, at inception, to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), including customer default rates. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our deferred purchase price related to the sales of service receivables and EIP receivables was $671 million and $659 million, respectively.The following table summarizes the impacts of the sale of certain service receivables and EIP receivables in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:


(in millions)September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Derecognized net service receivables and EIP receivables$2,362 $2,502Other current assets582 578of which, deferred purchase price581 576Other long-term assets90 83of which, deferred purchase price90 83Accounts payable and accrued liabilities13 17Other current liabilities155 129Other long-term liabilities2 4Net cash proceeds since inception1,963 2,030Of which:   Change in net cash proceeds during the year-to-date period(67) 536Net cash proceeds funded by reinvested collections2,030 1,494

We recognized losses from sales of receivables of $67 million and $59 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $242 million and $157 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These losses from sales of receivables were recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Losses from sales of receivables include adjustments to the receivables’ fair values and changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price.

Continuing Involvement

Pursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables and are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where write-off is imminent. We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales. While servicing the receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures to the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers. Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, under certain circumstances, we are required to deposit cash or replacement EIP receivables primarily for contracts terminated by customers under our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!”) Program.In addition, we have continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the sale arrangements. Our maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables sold under the sale arrangements was $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2017. The maximum exposure to loss, which is a required disclosure under GAAP, represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances whereby we would not receive the deferred purchase price portion of the contractual proceeds withheld by the purchasers and would also be required to repurchase the maximum amount of receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements without consideration for any recovery. As we believe the probability of these circumstances occurring is remote, the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of our expected loss.

Spectrum License Exchange

In March 2017, we closed on an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain spectrum licenses. Upon closing of the transaction, we recorded the spectrum licenses received at their estimated fair value of approximately $123 million and recognized a gain of $37 million included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.In September 2017, we closed on an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. Upon closing of the transaction, we recorded the spectrum licenses received at their estimated fair value of approximately $115 million and recognized a gain of $29 million included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Our spectrum licenses to be transferred as part of the exchange transaction were reclassified as assets held for sale and were included in Other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their carrying value of $184 million as of September 30, 2017.



Spectrum License Purchase

In September 2017, we entered into a UPA to purchase the remaining equity of INS. We expect to receive the INS spectrum licenses at the close of the transaction within the next 6 months, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. See Note 2 - Significant Transactions for further information.

Broadcast Incentive Auction

In April 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. At inception of the auction in June 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the FCC which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in April 2017. In May 2017, we paid the FCC the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing purchase commitments. See Note 7 - Debt for further information. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses as of September 30, 2017, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We began deployment of these licenses on our network in the third quarter of 2017.

Note 6 – Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates, accounts payable, and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility with DT approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The carrying amounts and fair values of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

The principal amounts and fair values of our long-term debt included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

Long-term Debt

The fair value of our Senior Notes to third parties was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore was classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Senior Notes to affiliates, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates, Senior Reset Notes to affiliates and Senior Secured Term Loans were determined based on a discounted cash flow approach using quoted prices of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for our standalone credit risk. Accordingly, our Senior Notes to affiliates, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates, Senior Reset Notes to affiliates and Senior Secured Term Loans were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Although we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Notes to affiliates, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates, Senior Reset Notes to affiliates and Senior Secured Term Loans to affiliates. The fair value estimates were based on information available as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange.


Deferred Purchase Price Assets

In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.

Guarantee Liabilities

We offer certain device trade-in programs, including JUMP!, which provide eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. For customers who are enrolled in a device trade-in program, we defer the portion of equipment revenues which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee incorporating the expected probability and timing of the handset upgrade and the estimated fair value of the used handset which is returned. Accordingly, our guarantee liabilities were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Guarantee liabilities are included in Other current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.The total estimated remaining gross EIP receivable balances of all enrolled handset upgrade program customers, which are the remaining EIP amounts underlying the JUMP! guarantee, including EIP receivables that have been sold, was $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2017. This is not an indication of our expected loss exposure as it does not consider the expected fair value of the used handset or the probability and timing of the trade-in.

(“T-Mobile USA”), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (“Incremental Term Loan Facility”) with DT, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increased DT’s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided T-Mobile USA with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment.On January 31, 2017, the loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on November 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on January 31, 2024. In July 2017, we repriced the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on January 31, 2024, with DT by reducing the interest rate to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00%. No issuance fees were incurred related to this debt agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.On March 31, 2017, the Incremental Term Loan Facility was amended to waive all interim principal payments. The outstanding principal balance will be due at maturity.During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we issued the following Senior Notes to DT:

These early redemption fees were recorded as discounts on the issuance of the new DT Notes.In September 2017, we issued to DT $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027, which is the final tranche of the new DT Notes. We were not required to pay any underwriting fees or issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes.Net proceeds from the issuance of the new DT Notes were $921 million and are included in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.On May 9, 2017, we exercised our option under existing purchase agreements and issued the following Senior Notes to DT:

Note 8 – Income Taxes

Within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, we recorded an Income tax expense of $356 million and $232 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $618 million and $651 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily from higher income before income taxes. The change for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily from a lower effective tax rate partially offset by higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 39.3% and 38.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 25.3% and 37.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions that resulted in the recognition of $270 million in tax benefits in the first quarter of 2017 and the recognition of an additional $19 million in tax benefits through the third quarter of 2017. Total tax benefits related to the reduction in the valuation allowance were $289 million through September 30, 2017. The effective tax rate was further decreased by the recognition of $62 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $24 million for the same period in 2016.During the first quarter of 2017, due to ongoing analysis of positive and negative evidence related to the utilization of the deferred tax assets, we determined that a portion of the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. Positive evidence supporting the release of a portion of the valuation allowance included reaching a position of cumulative income over a three-year period in the state jurisdictions as well as projecting sustained earnings in those jurisdictions. Due to this positive evidence, we reduced the valuation allowance which resulted in a decrease to Deferred tax liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We will continue to monitor positive and negative evidence related to the utilization of the remaining deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance continues to be provided. It is possible that we may release additional portions of the remaining valuation allowance within the next three months.

Note 9 – Earnings Per Share

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

Unless converted earlier, each share of preferred stock will convert automatically on December 15, 2017 into between 1.6119 (the minimum conversion rate) and 1.9342 (the maximum conversion rate) shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and depending on the applicable market value of our common stock. Using the minimum conversion rate, we would issue 32,238,000 shares of our common stock upon conversion. Potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share if to do so would have been anti-dilutive.

Commitments

Operating Leases and Purchase Commitments

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we entered into a purchase commitment with a handset Original Equipment Manufacturer, resulting in a material increase to the future minimum payments for purchase commitments summarized below.Future minimum payments for non-cancelable operating leases and purchase commitments are as follows:

Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements

In January 2017, T-Mobile USA entered into a REPA with Red Dirt Wind Project, LLC. The agreement is based on the expected operation of a wind energy-generating facility located in Oklahoma and will remain in effect until the twelfth anniversary of the facility’s entry into commercial operation. Commercial operation of the facility is expected to occur by the end of 2017. The REPA consists of two components: (1) an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility and (2) a commitment to purchase the renewable energy credits (“RECs”) associated with the energy output generated by the facility. T-Mobile USA will net settle the forward agreement and acquire the RECs monthly by paying, or receiving, an aggregate net payment based on two variables (1) the facility’s energy output, which has an estimated maximum capacity of approximately 160 megawatts and (2) the difference between (a) an initial fixed price, subject to annual escalation, and (b) current local marginal energy prices during the monthly settlement period. We have determined that the REPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPA does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the REPA did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility nor do we receive specific energy output from it. No amounts were settled under the agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.In August 2017, T-Mobile USA entered into a REPA with Solomon Forks Wind Project, LLC. The agreement is based on the expected operation of a wind energy-generating facility located in Kansas and will remain in effect until the fifteenth anniversary of the facility’s entry into commercial operation. Commercial operation of the facility is expected to occur by the end of 2018. The REPA consists of two components: (1) an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility and (2) a commitment to purchase the environmental attributes (“EACs”) associated with the energy output generated by the facility. T-Mobile USA will net settle the forward agreement and acquire the EACs monthly by paying, or receiving, an aggregate net payment based on two variables (1) the facility’s energy output, which has an estimated maximum capacity of approximately 160 megawatts and (2) the difference between (a) an initial fixed price, subject to annual escalation, and (b) current local marginal energy prices during the monthly settlement period. We have determined that the REPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPA does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the REPA did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility nor do we receive specific energy output from it. No amounts were settled under the agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Contingencies and Litigation

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (“Litigation Matters”) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include numerous court actions alleging that we are infringing various patents. Virtually all of the patent infringement cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages, although they occasionally seek injunctive relief as well. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could include an award of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months, if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements but that we do not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to: uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; uncertain damage theories and demands; and a less than fully developed factual record. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.


Note 11 – Guarantor Financial Information

Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, issued by T-Mobile USA (“Issuer”) is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of the Issuer’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”).In January 2017, T-Mobile USA, and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, borrowed $4.0 billion under the Incremental Term Loan Facility to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt.In March 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of public 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022, (ii) issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of public 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and (iii) issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of public 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027.In April 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022, (ii) issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and (iii) issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027. Additionally, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, redeemed through net settlement, the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.288% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2019 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 6.366% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2020.In May 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021, (ii) issued $1.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024.In September 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued the remaining $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027.See Note 7 - Debt for further information.The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. The indentures and credit facilities governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of the indentures and the supplemental indentures.Presented below is the condensed consolidating financial information as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.

Overview

The objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our condensed consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.



Business Overview

Effective January 1, 2017, the imputed discount on EIP receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and was previously recognized within Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is recognized within Other revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from the Company’s major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. We have applied this change retrospectively and the effect of this change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was a reclassification of $59 million and $189 million, respectively, from Interest income to Other revenues. The amortization of imputed discount on our EIP receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, was $74 million and $204 million, respectively. For additional information, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2017, we introduced, Un-carrier Next, where monthly wireless service fees and sales taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for T-Mobile ONE. We also unveiled Kickback on T-Mobile ONE, where participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit per qualifying line on their next month’s bill. In addition, we introduced the Un-contract for T-Mobile ONE with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan which allows current T-Mobile ONE customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.In September 2017, we introduced, Un-carrier Next: Netflix On Us, through an exclusive new partnership with Netflix where a standard monthly Netflix service plan is included at no charge to qualifying T-Mobile ONE customers on family plans.During the third quarter of 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes. Based on our preliminary assessment, the approximate impacts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, from lost revenue, assets damaged or destroyed and other hurricane related costs incurred are included in the table below. As of September 30, 2017, our loss assessment is ongoing and we expect additional expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be impacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily related to our operations in Puerto Rico. We have not recognized any potential insurance recoveries related to those hurricane losses as we continue to assess the damage and work with our insurance carriers.

Results of Operations


Highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016

•Total revenues of $10.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $714 million, or 8%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. On September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) partner for nominal consideration (the “MVNO Transaction”). The MVNO Transaction shifted Branded postpaid revenues to Wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.•Service revenues of $7.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $496 million, or 7%. The increase was primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, promotions and the success of our MetroPCS brand.•Equipment revenues of $2.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $170 million, or 9%. The increase was primarily due to an increase from customer purchases of leased devices at the end of the lease term, the liquidation of returned customer handsets and a higher average revenue per device sold, partially offset by lower lease revenues. •Operating income of $1.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $275 million, or 26%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in total service revenues and lower Depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, higher Cost of services expense and a decrease in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses.•Net income of $550 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $184 million, or 50%. The increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above and a net decrease in interest expense, partially offset by higher income tax expense primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes and the negative impact from hurricanes. Net income included net, after-tax gains of $18 million and $122 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Adjusted EBITDA (see “Performance Measures”), a non-GAAP financial measure, of $2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $133 million, or 5%. The increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. Adjusted EBITDA included pre-tax spectrum gains of $29 million and $199 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. •Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $622 million, or 36% (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).•Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $921 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $340 million, or 59% (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016

•Total revenues of $29.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $2.6 billion, or 9%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. On September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) partner for nominal consideration (the “MVNO Transaction”). The MVNO Transaction shifted Branded postpaid revenues to Wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.•Service revenues of $22.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $1.8 billion, or 9%. The increase was primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, promotions and the success of our MetroPCS brand.•Equipment revenues of $6.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $680 million, or 11%. The increase was primarily due to higher average revenue per device sold and an increase from customer purchases of leased devices at the end of the lease term, partially offset by lower lease revenues. •Operating income of $3.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $727 million, or 24%. The increase was primarily due to higher Total service revenues and lower Depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and higher Selling, general and administrative and Cost of services expenses.•Net income of $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $759 million, or 71%. The increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, a lower tax rate primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and a net decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes. Net income included net, after-tax gains of $41 million and $511 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $8.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $470 million, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. Adjusted EBITDA included pre-tax spectrum gains of $67 million and $835 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. •Net cash provided by operating activities of $5.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $1.4 billion, or 30% (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).•Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased $898 million, or 130% (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).Set forth below is a summary of our consolidated results:

The following discussion and analysis is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 unless otherwise stated.

Total revenues increased $714 million, or 8%, for the three months ended and $2.6 billion, or 9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to higher revenues from branded postpaid and prepaid customers as well as higher equipment revenues as discussed below. Branded postpaid revenues increased $273 million, or 6%, for the three months ended and $1.0 billion, or 7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.•Growth in the customer base driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices; and•The positive impact from a decrease in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash; partially offset by•The MVNO Transaction;•Lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user (“ARPU”); and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $20 million. •Growth in the customer base driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices, including the growing success of our business channel, T-Mobile for Business; and•The positive impact from a decrease in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash; partially offset by•The MVNO Transaction; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $20 million. Branded prepaid revenues increased $194 million, or 9%, for the three months ended and $683 million, or 11%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from:•Higher average branded prepaid customers primarily driven by growth in the customer base; and•Higher branded prepaid ARPU from the success of our MetroPCS brand; partially offset by•The impact from the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $11 million.Wholesale revenues increased $36 million, or 15%, for the three months ended and $133 million, or 21%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from the impact of increased Wholesale revenues resulting from the MVNO Transaction.Roaming and other service revenues decreased $7 million, or 11%, for the three months ended and $19 million, or 11%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Equipment revenues increased $170 million, or 9%, for the three months ended and $680 million, or 11%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.•An increase of $137 million from the purchase of leased devices at the end of their lease term;•An increase of $116 million primarily related to proceeds from the liquidation of returned customer handsets in the third quarter of 2017; •An increase of $78 million in device sales revenues excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to: •Higher average revenue per device sold primarily due to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) recall of its smartphone devices in the third quarter of 2016 and a decrease in promotional spending; partially offset by•A 5% decrease in the number of devices sold. Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale; and•An increase of $22 million in SIM and upgrade revenue; partially offset by •A decrease of $194 million in lease revenues from declining JUMP! On Demand population due to shifting focus to our EIP financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $8 million. •An increase of $413 million in device sales revenues excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to:•Higher average revenue per device sold primarily due to an increase in high-end device mix and an OEM recall of its smartphone devices in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by an increase in promotional spending; partially offset by •A 1% decrease in the number of devices sold. Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale;•An increase of $366 million from the purchase of leased devices at the end of the lease term; •An increase of $137 million primarily related to proceeds from the liquidation of returned customer handsets in the third quarter of 2017; and•An increase of $117 million in SIM and upgrade revenue; partially offset by •A decrease of $345 million in lease revenues from declining JUMP! On Demand population due to shifting focus to our EIP financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $8 million. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Revenue for purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues when revenue recognition criteria have been met. Gross EIP device financing to our customers increased by $115 million for the three months ended and $303 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to growth in the gross amount of equipment financed on EIP. The increase was also due to certain customers on leased devices reaching the end of lease term who financed their devices over nine-month EIP. Operating expenses increased $439 million, or 5%, for the three months ended and $1.9 billion, or 8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from higher Cost of services, Cost of equipment sales, Selling, general and administrative and lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by lower Depreciation and amortization as discussed below. Cost of services increased $158 million, or 11%, for the three months ended and $234 million, or 5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.•Higher lease expenses associated with our network expansion; •The negative impact from hurricanes of $69 million; partially offset by•Lower regulatory expenses.•Higher lease expenses associated with network expansion; and •The negative impact from hurricanes of $69 million; partially offset by •Lower long distance and toll costs as we continue to renegotiate contracts with vendors; and •Lower regulatory expenses. Cost of equipment sales increased $78 million, or 3%, for the three months ended and $617 million, or 8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. •An increase of $66 million in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to: •A higher average cost per device sold primarily from an OEM recall of its smartphone devices in the third quarter of 2016; partially offset by•A 5% decrease in the number of devices sold; and •An increase of $58 million in lease device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to: •An increase in lease buyouts as leases began reaching their term dates in 2017; partially offset by •A decrease in device upgrades from fewer customers in the handset lease program. •These increases are partially offset by a decrease of $31 million in cost of equipment related to an increase in proceeds from the liquidation of returned customer handsets under our insurance programs; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $4 million. •An increase of $483 million in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to: •A higher average cost per device sold primarily from an increase in high-end device mix and an OEM recall of its smartphone devices in the third quarter of 2016; partially offset by •A 1% decrease in the number of devices sold; and •An increase of $245 million in lease device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to: •An increase in lease buyouts as leases began reaching their term dates in 2017; partially offset by •A decrease in device upgrades from fewer customers in the handset lease program. •These increases are partially offset by a decrease of $69 million primarily due to inventory adjustments related to obsolete inventory; and•The negative impact from hurricanes of $4 million. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, upon device upgrade or at the end of the lease term, customers must return or purchase their device. The cost of purchased leased devices is recorded as Cost of equipment sales. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales.Selling, general and administrative increased $200 million, or 7%, for the three months ended and $549 million, or 7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher employee related costs, promotional costs, commissions, and higher costs related to managed services and outsourced functions, partially offset by lower external labor costs. Additionally, the negative impact from hurricanes of $36 million contributed to the increase. Depreciation and amortization decreased $152 million, or 10%, for the three months ended and $196 million, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from: •Lower depreciation expense related to our JUMP! On Demand program resulting from a lower number of devices under lease. Under our JUMP! On Demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value; partially offset by •The continued build-out of our 4G LTE network. Cost of MetroPCS business combination decreased $15 million for the three months ended and $110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. On July 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. We do not expect to incur significant additional network decommissioning costs in 2017.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses decreased $170 million, or 85%, for the three months ended and $768 million, or 92%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The change for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the first quarter of 2016.Net Income increased $184 million, or 50%, for the three months ended and $759 million, or 71%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from higher operating income and a net decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $90 million. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was partially offset by higher income tax expense as discussed below. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 additionally included the impact from a lower tax rate as discussed below.•Operating income, the components of which are discussed above and include the negative impact from hurricanes, increased $275 million, or 26%, for the three months ended and $727 million, or 24%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The negative impact from the hurricanes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was approximately $148 million.•Income tax expense increased $124 million, or 53%, for the three months ended and decreased $33 million, or 5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The change for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily from higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 39.3% and 38.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. •A lower effective tax rate which was 25.3% and 37.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions that resulted in the recognition of $270 million in tax benefits in the first quarter of 2017 and the recognition of an additional $19 million in tax benefits through the third quarter of 2017. Total tax benefits related to the reduction in the valuation allowance were $289 million through September 30, 2017. The effective tax rate was further decreased by the recognition of $62 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $24 million for the same period in 2016; partially offset by •Higher income before income taxes.

Performance Measures

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

Total Customers

A customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, mobile broadband devices (including tablets), or DIGITS, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include Machine to Machine (“M2M”) and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers:

(1)During the third quarter of 2017, we retitled our “Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers” category to “Branded postpaid other customers” and reclassified 253,000 DIGITS customers from our “Branded postpaid phone customers” category for the second quarter of 2017, when the DIGITS product was released.(2)The MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of branded postpaid phone customers and branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on September 1, 2016. Prospectively from September 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within Wholesale customers.(3)We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 160,000 and 4,368,000 reported wholesale customers as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2017 and the beginning of the second quarter of 2017, respectively. No further Lifeline adjustments are expected in future periods.

Branded Customers

Total branded customers increased 4,992,000, or 10%, primarily from: •Higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities and the growing success of our business channel, T-Mobile for Business, partially offset by increased competitive activity in the marketplace and less reliance on add a line promotions; •Higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our MetroPCS brand and continued growth from our distribution expansion, partially offset by the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and •Higher branded postpaid other customers primarily due to the launch of SyncUP DRIVETM and DIGITS.


Wholesale

Wholesale customers decreased 3,615,000, or 21%, primarily due to Lifeline subscribers, which were excluded from our reported wholesale subscriber base as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. This decrease was partially offset by the continued success of our M2M partnerships.

Branded Customers

Total branded net customer additions decreased 610,000, or 37%, for the three months ended and 1,613,000, or 33%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily from:•Lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher MetroPCS deactivations from a growing customer base and increased competitive activity in the marketplace, and•Lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions from increased competitive activity in the marketplace, the split and shift in iPhone launch timing, and the negative impact from hurricanes; partially offset by•Higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily driven by strength of SyncUP DRIVETM launched in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the launch of DIGITS in the second quarter of 2017.The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily from:•Lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher MetroPCS deactivations from a growing customer base and increased competitive activity in the marketplace. Additional decreases resulted from the optimization of our third party distribution channels, and•Lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions from increased competitive activity in the marketplace and lower customer migrations, partially offset by lower deactivations; partially offset by•Higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily driven by strength of SyncUP DRIVETM launched in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the launch of DIGITS in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by overall market softness of tablets.





Wholesale

Wholesale net customer additions decreased 31,000, or 10%, for the three months ended and 655,000, or 54%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from lower gross customer additions, partially offset by lower customer deactivations. We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 160,000 and 4,368,000 reported wholesale customers as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2017 and beginning of the second quarter of 2017, respectively. No further Lifeline adjustments are expected in future periods.

Customers Per Account

Customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone, mobile broadband, and DIGITS customers. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis. September 30, 2017 September 30, 2016 Change  # %Branded postpaid customers per account2.92 2.78 0.14 5%Branded postpaid customers per account increased 0.14 points, or 5%, primarily from growth of customers on family plan promotions.


Churn

Churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

Branded postpaid phone churn decreased 9 basis points for the three months ended and 12 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the MVNO Transaction as the customers transferred had a higher rate of churn.Branded prepaid churn increased 43 basis points for the three months ended and 20 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to higher MetroPCS churn from increased competitive activity in the marketplace.


Average Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per User

ARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband and DIGITS customers and related revenues. Average Billings Per User (“ABPU”) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings before securitization, per customer. We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.The following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:

Branded prepaid ARPU increased $0.92, or 2%, for the three months ended and $0.89, or 2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily from continued growth of MetroPCS customers who generate higher ARPU. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes of $0.18 and $0.06 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain expenses not reflective of T-Mobile’s operating performance. Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, capital leases, common and preferred stock, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities with DT.

Cash Flows

The following is an analysis of our cash flows for three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $622 million, or 36%, for the three months ended and $1.4 billion, or 30%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•Higher net income and higher non-cash adjustments to net income and a lower net use from working capital changes.•Higher Net income and higher non-cash adjustments to net income including from lower Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and Depreciation and amortization. In total, changes in working capital were relatively flat as improvements in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Inventories were partially offset by changes in Equipment installment plan receivables. The change in EIP receivables was primarily due to a decrease in net cash proceeds from the sale of EIP receivables as the nine months ended September 30, 2016 benefited from net cash proceeds of $366 million primarily related to upsizing of the EIP securitization facility as well as an increase in devices financed on EIP.

On January 25, 2017, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (“Incremental Term Loan Facility”) with DT, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increased DT’s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided T-Mobile USA with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment.On January 31, 2017, the loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on November 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on January 31, 2024. In July 2017, we repriced the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on January 31, 2024, with DT by reducing the interest rate to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00%. No issuance fees were incurred related to this debt agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.On March 31, 2017, the Incremental Term Loan Facility was amended to waive all interim principal payments. The outstanding principal balance will be due at maturity.During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we issued the following Senior Notes to DT:

These early redemption fees were recorded as discounts on the issuance of the new DT Notes.In September 2017, we issued to DT $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027, which is the final tranche of the new DT Notes. We were not required to pay any underwriting fees or issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes.Net proceeds from the issuance of the new DT Notes were $921 million and are included in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.On May 9, 2017, we exercised our option under existing purchase agreements and issued the following Senior Notes to DT:

The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of spectrum licenses won in the 600 MHz spectrum auction. Net proceeds from these issuances include $64 million in debt premiums. See Note 5 - Spectrum License Transactions for further information.

Revolving Credit Facility

We had no outstanding borrowings under our $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility with DT as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in Proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and Repayments of revolving credit facility within Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.We could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2017, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions or other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions and redemption of high yield callable debt.We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of September 30, 2017.

Capital Lease Facilities

We have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. As of September 30, 2017, we have committed to $2.0 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $138 million and $735 million was executed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. We expect to enter into up to an additional $165 million in capital lease commitments during 2017.

Capital Expenditures

Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017, excluding capitalized interest. We expect to be at the high end of the range. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.In April 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. At the inception of the auction in June 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the FCC which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in April 2017. In May 2017, we paid the FCC the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing debt purchase commitments. See Note 7 - Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.The $5.8 billion payment of the purchase price is included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits within Net cash used in investing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses as of September 30, 2017, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We began deployment of these licenses on our network in the third quarter of 2017. See Note 5 - Spectrum License Transactions of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.




Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis through November 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In August 2017, the arrangement was amended to reduce the maximum funding commitment to $1.2 billion and extend the scheduled expiration date to November 2018. In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through March 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In November 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million and extend the scheduled expiration date to March 2018. As of September 30, 2017, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.4 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 4 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Related-Party Transactions

Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the three months ended September 30, 2017, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with DT. We have relied upon DT for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company (“MTN Irancell”), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $1.0 million and estimated net profits were less than $1.0 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” “we,” “our,” “us” or “the Company”) include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.The condensed consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (“VIE”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations (Tower obligations are included in VIEs related to the 2012 Tower Transaction. See Note 8 - Tower Obligations for further information). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year

Leases

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” and has since modified the standard with several ASUs (collectively, the “new lease standard”). The new lease standard is effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on January 1, 2019.We adopted the standard by recognizing and measuring leases at the adoption date with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application and as a result did not restate the prior periods presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.The new lease standard provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We did not elect the “package of practical expedients” and as a result reassessed under the new lease standard our prior accounting conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We elected to use hindsight for determining the reasonably certain lease term. We did not elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements as it is not applicable to us.The new lease standard provides practical expedients and policy elections for an entity’s ongoing accounting. Generally, we elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components in arrangements whereby we are the lessee. For arrangements in which we are lessor we did not elect this practical expedient. We did not elect the short-term lease recognition exemption, which includes the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition. We have also applied this election to all active leases at transition. The most significant judgments and impacts upon adoption of the standard include the following:•In evaluating contracts to determine if they qualify as a lease, we consider factors such as if we have obtained or transferred substantially all of the rights to the underlying asset through exclusivity, if we can or if we have transferred the ability to direct the use of the asset by making decisions about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor has substantive substitution rights. •We recognized right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded. The lease liability for operating leases is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments.







9

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

The right-of-use asset for operating leases is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amounts such as prepaid rent and deferred rent, which we remeasured at adoption due to the application of hindsight to our lease term estimates. Deferred and prepaid rent will no longer be presented separately. •Capital lease assets previously included within Property and equipment, net were reclassified to financing lease right-of-use assets, and capital lease liabilities previously included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt were reclassified to financing lease liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.•Certain line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the “Supplementary disclosure of cash flow information” have been renamed to align with the new terminology presented in the new lease standard; “Repayment of capital lease obligations” is now presenting as “Repayments of financing lease obligations” and “Assets acquired under capital lease obligations” is now presenting as “Financing lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations.” In the “Operating Activities” section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we have added “Operating lease right-of-use assets” and “Short and long-term operating lease liabilities” which represent the change in the operating lease asset and liability, respectively. Additionally, in the “Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information” section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we have added “Operating lease payments,” and in the “Noncash investing and financing activities” section we have added “Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations.”•In determining the discount rate used to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability, we use rates implicit in the lease, or if not readily available, we use our incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of a risk-free LIBOR rate plus a credit spread as secured by our assets.•Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation was incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. •We elected the use of hindsight whereby we applied current lease term assumptions that are applied to new leases in determining the expected lease term period for all cell sites. Upon adoption of the new lease standard and application of hindsight, our expected lease term has shortened to reflect payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only. This assessment corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases and aligns with the payments that have been disclosed as lease commitments in prior years. As a result, the average remaining lease term for cell sites has decreased from approximately nine to five years based on lease contracts in effect at transition on January 1, 2019. The aggregate impact of using the hindsight is an estimated decrease in Total operating expense of $240 million in fiscal year 2019.•We were also required to reassess the previously failed sale-leasebacks of certain T-Mobile-owned wireless communication tower sites and determine whether the transfer of the assets to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criteria in the revenue standard and whether a sale should be recognized.•We concluded that a sale has not occurred for the 6,200 tower sites transferred to Crown Castle International Corp. (“CCI”) pursuant to a master prepaid lease arrangement; therefore, these sites will continue to be accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks.  •We concluded that a sale should be recognized for the 900 tower sites transferred to CCI pursuant to the sale of a subsidiary and for the 500 tower sites transferred to Phoenix Tower International (“PTI”). Upon adoption on January 1, 2019, we derecognized our existing long-term financial obligation and the tower-related property and equipment associated with these 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites and recognized a lease liability and right-of-use asset for the leaseback of the tower sites. The estimated impacts from the change in accounting conclusion are primarily a decrease in Other revenues of $44 million and a decrease in Interest expense of $34 million in fiscal year 2019.•Rental revenues and expenses associated with co-location tower sites are presented on a net basis under the new lease standard. These revenues and expenses were presented on a gross basis under the former lease standard.

Including the impacts from a change in the accounting conclusion on the 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites, the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 is as follows:

Including the impacts from the change in the accounting conclusion on the 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites and the change in presentation on the income statement of the 6,200 tower sites for which a sale did not occur, the cumulative effects of initially applying the new lease standard for fiscal year 2019 are estimated as follows:•The aggregate impact is a decrease in Other revenues of $185 million, a decrease in Total operating expenses of $380 million, a decrease in Interest expense of $34 million and an increase to Net income of $175 million. •The expected impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is a decrease in Net cash provided by operating activities of $10 million and a decrease in Net cash used in financing activities of $10 million.For arrangements where we are the lessor, including arrangements to lease devices to our service customers, the adoption of the new lease standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements as these leases are classified as operating leases. Device lease payments are presented as Equipment revenues and recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Recognition of equipment revenue on lease contracts that are determined to not be probable of collection are limited to the amount of payments received. We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the consideration in the contract all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes).At operating lease inception, leased wireless devices are transferred from Inventory to Property and equipment, net. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net, are recorded as Inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.We do not have any leasing transactions with related parties. See Note 11 - Leases for further information. We have implemented significant new lease accounting systems, processes and internal controls over lease accounting to assist us in the application of the new lease standard.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” and has since modified the standard with several ASUs (collectively, the “new credit loss standard”). The new credit loss standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new credit loss standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, and will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). We are in the process of developing an expected credit loss model, identifying forward-looking loss indicators and assessing the impact on our receivables portfolio. We will adopt the new credit loss standard on January 1, 2020.

Cloud Computing Arrangements

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Topic 350): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract.” The standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, and can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2020. Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) did not have, or are not expected to have, a significant impact on our present or future Consolidated Financial Statements.



Note 2 - Significant Transactions

Business Combinations

Proposed Sprint Transaction

On April 29, 2018, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”) to merge with Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”). See Note 3 - Business Combinations for further information.

Sales of Certain Receivables

In February 2019, the service receivable sale arrangement was amended to extend the scheduled expiration date, as well as extend certain third-party credit support under the arrangement, to March 2021. See Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.

Note Redemption

Effective April 28, 2019, we redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.332% Senior Reset Notes due 2023 (the “DT Senior Reset Notes”) held by Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), our majority stockholder. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.666% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and were paid on April 29, 2019. The redemption premium was $28 million and was included in Other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Certain components of the reset features were required to be bifurcated from the DT Senior Reset Notes and were separately accounted for as embedded derivatives. The write-off of embedded derivatives upon redemption resulted in a gain of $11 million which was included in Other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements for further information.

Note 3 – Business Combinations

Proposed Sprint Transactions

On April 29, 2018, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement to merge with Sprint in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock (the “Merger”). The combined company will be named “T-Mobile” and, as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to rapidly launch a broad and deep nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. Neither T-Mobile nor Sprint on its own could generate comparable benefits to consumers. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (collectively, the “Transactions”) have been approved by the boards of directors of T-Mobile and Sprint and the required approvals of the stockholders of each of T-Mobile and Sprint have been obtained. Immediately following the Merger, it is anticipated that DT and SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) will hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 41.7% and 27.4%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 30.9% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders, based on closing share prices and certain other assumptions as of December 31, 2018. In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”) entered into a commitment letter, dated as of April 29, 2018 (as amended and restated on May 15, 2018, the “Commitment Letter”). The funding of the debt facilities provided for in the Commitment Letter is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, including consummation of the Merger. The proceeds of the debt financing provided for in the Commitment Letter will be used to refinance certain existing debt of us, Sprint and our and Sprint’s respective subsidiaries and for post-closing working capital needs of the combined company. In connection with the financing provided for in the Commitment Letter, we expect to incur certain fees if the Merger is consummated. There were no fees accrued as of June 30, 2019. We also may be required to draw down on the $7 billion secured term loan facility prior to closing of the Merger and, if so, will be required to place the proceeds in escrow and pay interest thereon until the Merger closes.In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, DT and T-Mobile USA entered into a financing matters agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018, pursuant to which DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to DT. There were no consent payments accrued as of June 30, 2019.On May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement dated as of May 14, 2018, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to certain existing debt of us and our subsidiaries. If the Merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to third-party note holders. There were no consent payments accrued as of June 30, 2019.Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Sprint may be required to reimburse us for 33% of the upfront consent and related bank fees we paid, or $14 million, if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated. There were no reimbursements accrued as of June 30, 2019. On May 18, 2018, Sprint also obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to certain existing debt of Sprint and its subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, we may also be required to reimburse Sprint for 67% of the upfront consent and related bank fees it paid, or $162 million, if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated. There were no fees accrued as of June 30, 2019. We recognized merger-related costs of $222 million and $41 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $335 million and $41 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs generally included consulting and legal fees and were recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.The consummation of the Transactions remains subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive final federal regulatory approval in the third quarter of 2019 and currently anticipate that the Transactions will be permitted to close in the second half of the year. The Business Combination Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Sprint and us. If we terminate the Business Combination Agreement in connection with a failure to satisfy the closing condition related to specified minimum credit ratings for the combined company on the closing date of the Merger (after giving effect to the Merger) from at least two of the three credit rating agencies, then in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Sprint an amount equal to $600 million.

On June 18, 2018, we filed the Public Interest Statement and applications for approval of the Merger with the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). On July 18, 2018, the FCC issued a Public Notice formally accepting our applications and establishing a period for public comment. On May 20, 2019, to facilitate the FCC’s review and approval of the FCC license transfers associated with the proposed Merger, we and Sprint filed with the FCC a written ex parte presentation (the “Presentation”) relating to the proposed Merger. The Presentation included proposed commitments from us and Sprint. Following the Presentation, we received statements of support for the Merger by the FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Commissioners Carr and O’Rielly. Formal action on the Merger by the FCC remains pending. On June 11, 2019, the attorneys general of nine states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against us, DT, Sprint, and Softbank Group Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 25, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint including as plaintiffs four additional state attorneys general. Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges that the Merger, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and should be enjoined. We and the other defendants answered plaintiffs’ amended complaint on July 9, 2019, and discovery is ongoing. We believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously.On July 26, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Sprint and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”). We and Sprint are collectively referred to as the “Sellers.” Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, following the consummation of the Merger, DISH will acquire Sprint’s prepaid wireless business, currently operated under the Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shenandoah Telecommunications Company and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), including customer accounts, inventory, contracts, intellectual property and certain other specified assets (the “Prepaid Business”), and will assume certain related liabilities (the “Prepaid Transaction”). DISH will pay the Sellers $1.4 billion for the Prepaid Business, subject to a working capital adjustment. The consummation of the Prepaid Transaction is subject to the consummation of the Merger and other customary closing conditions.At the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, the Sellers and DISH will enter into (i) a License Purchase Agreement pursuant to which (a) the Sellers will sell certain 800 MHz spectrum licenses held by Sprint to DISH for a total of approximately $3.6 billion in a transaction to be completed, subject to certain additional closing conditions, following an application for FCC approval to be filed three years following the closing of the Merger and (b) the Sellers will have the option to lease back from DISH, as needed, a portion of the spectrum sold for an additional two years following the closing of the spectrum sale transaction, (ii) a Transition Services Agreement providing for the Sellers’ provision of transition services to DISH in connection with the Prepaid Business for a period of up to three years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, (iii) a Master Network Services Agreement providing for the Sellers’ provision of network services to customers of the Prepaid Business for a period of up to seven years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, and (iv) an Option to Acquire Tower and Retail Assets offering DISH the option to acquire certain decommissioned towers and retail locations from the Sellers, subject to obtaining all necessary third-party consents, for a period of up to five years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction.On July 26, 2019, in connection with the entry into the Asset Purchase Agreement, we and the other parties to the Business Combination Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Business Combination Agreement. The Amendment extends the Outside Date (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) to November 1, 2019, or, if the Marketing Period (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) has started and is in effect at such date, then January 2, 2020. The Amendment also provides that the closing of the Merger will occur on the first business day of the first month (other than the third month of any calendar quarter) where such first business day is at least three business days following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the closing of the Merger, or, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of such satisfaction or waiver, the closing shall occur on the earlier of (a) any date during or after the Marketing Period specified by T-Mobile (subject to the consent of Sprint to the extent such date falls after the Outside Date) or (b) the first business day of the first month (other than the third month of any calendar quarter) where such first business day is at least three business days following the final day of the Marketing Period. The Amendment also modifies the Business Combination Agreement so as to limit the actions the parties may be required to undertake or agree to in order to obtain any remaining governmental consents or avoid an action or proceeding by any governmental entity in connection with the Transactions, recognizing the substantial undertakings already agreed to by the parties, including the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.On July 26, 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed a complaint and a proposed final judgment (the “Proposed Consent Decree”) agreed to by us, DT, Sprint, SoftBank and DISH with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Proposed Consent Decree would fully resolve DOJ’s investigation into the Merger and would require the parties to, among other things, carry out the divestitures to be made pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement described above upon closing of the Merger. The Proposed Consent Decree is subject to judicial approval.

The consummation of the Merger remains subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive final federal regulatory approval in the third quarter of 2019 and currently anticipate that the Merger will be permitted to close in the second half of the year.


Note 4 – Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses

Our portfolio of receivables is comprised of two portfolio segments, accounts receivable and EIP receivables. Our accounts receivable segment primarily consists of amounts currently due from customers, including service and leased device receivables, other carriers and third-party retail channels.Based upon customer credit profiles, we classify the EIP receivables segment into two customer classes of “Prime” and “Subprime.” Prime customer receivables are those with lower delinquency risk and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher delinquency risk. Customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases. In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category are required to pay an advance deposit.To determine a customer’s credit profile, we use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores and service and device plan characteristics.



The following table summarizes the EIP receivables, including imputed discounts and related allowance for credit losses:
(in millions)June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018EIP receivables, gross$4,490 $4,534Unamortized imputed discount(335) (330)EIP receivables, net of unamortized imputed discount4,155 4,204Allowance for credit losses(105) (119)EIP receivables, net$4,050 $4,085Classified on the balance sheet as:   Equipment installment plan receivables, net$2,446 $2,538Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net1,604 1,547EIP receivables, net$4,050 $4,085

To determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider a number of credit quality indicators, including historical credit losses and timely payment experience as well as current collection trends such as write-off frequency and severity, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions.We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit quality and the aging of the receivable.For EIP receivables, subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.The EIP receivables had weighted average effective imputed interest rates of 9.6% and 10.0% as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables

We have entered into transactions to sell certain service and EIP receivables. The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our condensed consolidated financial statements, are described below.

Sales of Service Accounts Receivable

Overview of the Transaction

In 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis (the “service receivable sale arrangement”). The maximum funding commitment of the service receivable sale arrangement is $950 million. In February 2019, the service receivable sale arrangement was amended to extend the scheduled expiration date, as well as certain third-party credit support under the arrangement, to March 2021. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the service receivable sale arrangement provided funding of $950 million and $774 million, respectively. Sales of receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. The receivables consist of service charges currently due from customers and are short-term in nature.In connection with the service receivable sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity, to sell service accounts receivable (the “Service BRE”). The Service BRE does not qualify as a VIE, and due to the significant level of control we exercise over the entity, it is consolidated. Pursuant to the service receivable sale arrangement, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries transfer selected receivables to the Service BRE. The Service BRE then sells the receivables to an unaffiliated entity (the “Service VIE”), which was established to facilitate the sale of beneficial ownership interests in the receivables to certain third parties.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Variable Interest Entity

We determined that the Service VIE qualifies as a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities. We have a variable interest in the Service VIE but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Service VIE’s economic performance. Those activities include committing the Service VIE to legal agreements to purchase or sell assets, selecting which receivables are purchased in the service receivable sale arrangement, determining whether the Service VIE will sell interests in the purchased service receivables to other parties, funding of the entity and servicing of receivables. We do not hold the power to direct the key decisions underlying these activities. For example, while we act as the servicer of the sold receivables, which is considered a significant activity of the Service VIE, we are acting as an agent in our capacity as the servicer and the counterparty to the service receivable sale arrangement has the ability to remove us as the servicing agent of the receivables at will with no recourse available to us. As we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, the balances and results of the Service VIE are not included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consists primarily of the deferred purchase price and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to our variable interest in the Service VIE:

Sales of EIP Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis (the “EIP sale arrangement”). The maximum funding commitment of the EIP sale arrangement is $1.3 billion, and the scheduled expiration date is November 2020.As of both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the EIP sale arrangement provided funding of $1.3 billion. Sales of EIP receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. In connection with this EIP sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “EIP BRE”). Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, our wholly-owned subsidiary transfers selected receivables to the EIP BRE. The EIP BRE then sells the receivables to a non-consolidated and unaffiliated third-party entity for which we do not exercise any level of control, nor does the third-party entity qualify as a VIE.



Variable Interest Entity

We determined that the EIP BRE is a VIE as its equity investment at risk lacks the obligation to absorb a certain portion of its expected losses. We have a variable interest in the EIP BRE and determined that we are the primary beneficiary based on our ability to direct the activities which most significantly impact the EIP BRE’s economic performance. Those activities include selecting which receivables are transferred into the EIP BRE and sold in the EIP sale arrangement and funding of the EIP BRE. Additionally, our equity interest in the EIP BRE obligates us to absorb losses and gives us the right to receive benefits from the EIP BRE that could potentially be significant to the EIP BRE. Accordingly, we include the balances and results of operations of the EIP BRE in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consists primarily of the deferred purchase price and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to the EIP BRE:
(in millions)June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018Other current assets$340 $321Other assets74 88Other long-term liabilities23 22

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

In addition, the EIP BRE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to any liquidation of the EIP BRE, to be satisfied prior to any value in the EIP BRE becoming available to us. Accordingly, the assets of the EIP BRE may not be used to settle our general obligations and creditors of the EIP BRE have limited recourse to our general credit.

Sales of Receivables

The transfers of service receivables and EIP receivables to the non-consolidated entities are accounted for as sales of financial assets. Once identified for sale, the receivable is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Upon sale, we derecognize the net carrying amount of the receivables. We recognize the cash proceeds received upon sale in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We recognize proceeds net of the deferred purchase price, consisting of a receivable from the purchasers that entitles us to certain collections on the receivables. We recognize the collection of the deferred purchase price in Net cash used in investing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions.The deferred purchase price represents a financial asset that is primarily tied to the creditworthiness of the customers and which can be settled in such a way that we may not recover substantially all of our recorded investment, due to default by the customers on the underlying receivables. We elected, at inception, to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), including customer default rates. As of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, our deferred purchase price related to the sales of service receivables and EIP receivables was $763 million and $746 million, respectively.



The following table summarizes the impact of the sale of certain service receivables and EIP receivables in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

We recognized losses from sales of receivables, including adjustments to the receivables’ fair values and changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price, of $28 million and $27 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $63 million and $79 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Continuing Involvement

Pursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables and are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where write-off is imminent. We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales. While servicing the receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures to the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers. Pursuant to the EIP sale

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

arrangement, under certain circumstances, we are required to deposit cash or replacement EIP receivables primarily for contracts terminated by customers under our JUMP! Program.In addition, we have continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the sale arrangements. Our maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables sold under the sale arrangements was $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2019. The maximum exposure to loss, which is a required disclosure under U.S. GAAP, represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances whereby we would not receive the deferred purchase price portion of the contractual proceeds withheld by the purchasers and would also be required to repurchase the maximum amount of receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements without consideration for any recovery. We believe the probability of these circumstances occurring is remote and the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of our expected loss.



Note 6 – Spectrum License Transactions

Spectrum Licenses

The following table summarizes our spectrum license activity for the six months ended June 30, 2019:

The following is a summary of significant spectrum transactions for the six months ended June 30, 2019:

Millimeter Wave Spectrum Auctions

In June 2019, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 2,211 licenses in the 24 GHz and 28 GHz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $842 million. At the inception of the 28 GHz spectrum auction in October 2018, we deposited $20 million with the FCC. Upon conclusion of the 28 GHz spectrum auction in February 2019, we made an additional payment of $19 million for the purchase price of licenses won in the auction. At the inception of the 24 GHz spectrum auction in February 2019, we deposited $147 million with the FCC. Upon conclusion of the 24 GHz spectrum auction in June 2019, we made an additional payment of $656 million for the purchase price of licenses won in the auction. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses as of June 30, 2019, in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash payments to acquire spectrum licenses and payments for costs to clear spectrum are included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.





Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Accounts receivable from affiliates, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility with DT, our majority stockholder, approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Interest rate lock derivatives
Periodically, we use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, such as interest rate risk. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship (cash flow hedge) to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

19

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

We record interest rate lock derivatives on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value that is derived primarily from observable market data, including yield curves. Interest rate lock derivatives were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Cash flows associated with qualifying hedge derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the item being hedged.In October 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives was a liability of $1.1 billion and $447 million as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and were included in Other current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, no amounts were accrued or amortized into Interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Aggregate changes in fair value, net of tax, of $813 million and $332 million are presented in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The interest rate lock derivatives will be settled upon the issuance of fixed-rate debt, expected to occur prior to December 31, 2020. Upon settlement of the interest rate lock derivatives, we will receive, or make, a cash payment in the amount of the fair value of the cash flow hedge as of the settlement date. There were no cash payments or receipts associated with these derivatives for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

Embedded derivatives
Effective April 28, 2019, we redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.332% Senior Reset Notes due 2023 held by DT. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.666% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and were paid on April 29, 2019. The write-off of embedded derivatives upon redemption of the DT Senior Reset Notes resulted in a gain of $11 million, which was included in Other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
Deferred Purchase Price Assets

In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates. See Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.

The carrying amounts and fair values of our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:
Level within the Fair Value Hierarchy June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018(in millions) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair ValueAssets:         Deferred purchase price assets3 $763 $763 $746 $746

Long-term Debt

The fair value of our Senior Notes to third parties was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore was classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of our Senior Notes to affiliates, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates were determined based on a discounted cash flow approach using market interest rates of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for our standalone credit risk. Accordingly, our Senior Notes to affiliates, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Although we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Notes to affiliates, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates. The fair value estimates were based on information available as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange.

Guarantee Liabilities

We offer a device trade-in program, JUMP!, which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee, incorporating the expected probability and timing of handset upgrade and the estimated fair value of the handset which is returned. Accordingly, our guarantee liabilities were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Guarantee liabilities are included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amounts of our guarantee liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were $71 million and $73 million as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.The total estimated remaining gross EIP receivable balances of all enrolled handset upgrade program customers, which are the remaining EIP amounts underlying the JUMP! guarantee, including EIP receivables that have been sold, was $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2019. This is not an indication of our expected loss exposure as it does not consider the expected fair value of the used handset or the probability and timing of the trade-in.




Note 8 – Tower Obligations

In 2012, we conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 7,100 T-Mobile-owned wireless communication tower sites (“CCI Tower Sites”) in exchange for net proceeds of $2.5 billion (the “2012 Tower Transaction”). Rights to approximately 6,200 of the tower sites were transferred to CCI via a master prepaid lease with site lease terms ranging from 23 to 37 years (“CCI Lease Sites”), while the remaining tower sites were sold to CCI (“CCI Sales Sites”). CCI has fixed-price purchase options for the CCI Lease Sites totaling approximately $2.0 billion, exercisable at the end of the lease term. We lease back space at certain tower sites for an initial term of ten years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms.In 2015, we conveyed to PTI the exclusive right to manage and operate certain T-Mobile-owned wireless communication tower sites (“PTI Sales Sites”) in exchange for net proceeds of approximately $140 million (the “2015 Tower Transaction”). As of June 30, 2019, rights to approximately 150 of the tower sites remain operated by PTI under a management agreement (“PTI Managed Sites”). We lease back space at certain tower sites for an initial term of ten years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms.Assets and liabilities associated with the operation of the tower sites were transferred to special purpose entities (“SPEs”). Assets included ground lease agreements or deeds for the land on which the towers are situated, the towers themselves and existing subleasing agreements with other mobile network operator tenants, who lease space at the tower sites. Liabilities included the obligation to pay ground lease rentals, property taxes and other executory costs. Upon closing of the 2012 Tower Transaction, CCI acquired all of the equity interests in the SPE containing CCI Sales Sites and an option to acquire the CCI Lease Sites at the end of their respective lease terms and entered into a master lease agreement under which we agreed to lease back space at certain of the tower sites. Upon closing of the 2015 Tower Transaction, PTI acquired all of the equity interests in the SPEs containing PTI Sales Sites and entered into a master lease agreement under which we agreed to lease back space at certain of the tower sites.We determined the SPEs containing the CCI Lease Sites (“Lease Site SPEs”) are VIEs as our equity investment lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. These activities include managing tenants and underlying ground leases, performing repair and maintenance on the towers, the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive the expected future residual returns from the purchase option to acquire the CCI Lease Sites. As we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest in the Lease Site SPEs, the balances and operating results of the Lease Site SPEs are not included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.Due to our continuing involvement with the tower sites, we previously determined that we were precluded from applying sale-leaseback accounting. We recorded long-term financial obligations in the amount of the net proceeds received and recognized interest on the tower obligations at a rate of approximately 8% for the 2012 Tower Transaction and 5% for the 2015 Tower Transaction using the effective interest method. The tower obligations are increased by interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI or PTI and through net cash flows generated and retained by CCI or PTI from operation of the tower sites. Our historical tower site asset costs continue to be reported in Property and equipment, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are depreciated.Upon adoption of the new leasing standard we were required to reassess the previously failed sale-leasebacks and determine whether the transfer of the assets to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criteria in the revenue standard and whether a sale should be recognized. We concluded that a sale has not occurred for the CCI Lease Sites and these sites continue to be accounted for as a failed sale-leaseback. We concluded that a sale had occurred for the CCI Sales Sites and

the PTI Sales Sites and therefore we derecognized our existing long-term financial obligation and the tower-related property and equipment associated with these sites as part of the cumulative effect adjustment on January 1, 2019.

The following table summarizes the balances of the failed sale-leasebacks in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:
(in millions)June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018Property and equipment, net$224 $329Tower obligations2,247 2,557

Future minimum payments related to the tower obligations are approximately $157 million for the year ending June 30, 2020, $315 million in total for the years ending June 30, 2021 and 2022, $315 million in total for years ending June 30, 2023 and 2024, and $537 million in total for years thereafter.

We are contingently liable for future ground lease payments through the remaining term of the CCI Lease Sites. These contingent obligations are not included in Operating lease liabilities as any amount due is contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. See Note 11 - Leases for further information.


Note 9 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation of Revenue

We provide wireless communication services to three primary categories of customers: •Branded postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communication services utilizing phones, DIGITS, or connected devices which includes tablets, wearables and SyncUP DRIVE™; •Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communication services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile; and•Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.


Branded postpaid service revenues, including branded postpaid phone revenues and branded postpaid other revenues, were as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2019 2018 2019 2018Branded postpaid service revenues       Branded postpaid phone revenues$5,287 $4,892 $10,470 $9,703Branded postpaid other revenues326 272 636 531Total branded postpaid service revenues$5,613 $5,164 $11,106 $10,234

We operate as a single operating segment. The balances presented within each revenue line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income represent categories of revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by type of product and service. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as handset insurance services. Revenue generated from the lease of mobile communication devices is included within Equipment revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Contract Balances

The opening and closing balances of our contract asset and contract liability balances from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, were as follows:
(in millions)Contract Assets Included in Other Current Assets Contract Liabilities Included in Deferred RevenueBalance as of December 31, 2018$51 $645Balance as of June 30, 201942 571Change$(9) $(74)

Contract assets primarily represent revenue recognized for equipment sales with promotional bill credits offered to customers that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract. The change in the contract asset balance includes customer activity related to new promotions, offset by billings on existing contracts and impairment which is recognized as bad debt expense.Contract liabilities are recorded when fees are collected, or we have an unconditional right to consideration (a receivable) in advance of delivery of goods or services. The change in contract liabilities is primarily related to customer activity associated with our prepaid plans including the receipt of cash payments and the satisfaction of our performance obligations.


Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, include the following:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2019 2018 2019 2018Amounts included in the beginning of period contract liability balance$43 $31 $603 $559

Remaining Performance Obligations

As of June 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining service performance obligations for branded postpaid contracts with promotional bill credits that result in an extended service contract is $234 million. We expect to recognize this revenue as service is provided over the extended contract term in the next 24 months.Certain of our wholesale, roaming and other service contracts include variable consideration based on usage. This variable consideration has been excluded from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations. As of June 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the contractual minimum consideration allocated to remaining service performance obligations for wholesale, roaming and other service contracts is $652 million, $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion for 2019, 2020 and 2021 and beyond, respectively. These contracts have a remaining duration of less than one to eleven years.Information about remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less have been excluded from the above, which primarily consists of monthly service contracts. The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining service performance obligations includes the estimated amount to be invoiced to the customer.



Contract Costs

The total balance of deferred incremental costs to obtain contracts as of June 30, 2019, was $765 million compared to $644 million as of December 31, 2018. Deferred contract costs incurred to obtain postpaid service contracts are amortized over a period of 24 months. The amortization period is monitored to reflect any significant change in assumptions. Amortization of deferred contract costs was $137 million and $57 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $253 million and $92 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.The deferred contract cost asset is assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. There were no impairment losses recognized on deferred contract cost assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.



Note 10 – Earnings Per Share

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

Lessee

We are lessee for non-cancellable operating and finance leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores and office facilities with contractual terms through 2029. The majority of cell site leases have an initial non-cancelable term of five to ten years with several renewal options that can extend the lease term from five to thirty-five years. In addition, we have finance leases for network equipment that generally have a non-cancelable lease term of two to five years; the finance leases do not have renewal options and contain a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease.

JUMP! On Demand allows customers to lease a device (handset or tablet) over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. The purchase price at the expiration of the lease is established at lease commencement and reflects the estimated residual value of the device, which reflects the estimated fair value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. The JUMP! On Demand leases do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments, and there are no restrictions or covenants imposed by these leases. Leased wireless devices are included in Property and equipment, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Leases (Topic 840) Disclosures

On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using a modified-retrospective approach by recognizing and measuring leases at the adoption date with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application and did not restate the prior periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As such, prior periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements continue to be in accordance with the former lease standard, Topic 840 Leases. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.

Operating Leases

Under the previous lease standard, we had non-cancellable operating leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores and office facilities. As of December 31, 2018, these leases had contractual terms expiring through 2028, with the majority of cell site leases having an initial non-cancelable term of five to ten years with several renewal options. In addition, we had operating leases for dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2027. Our commitments under leases existing as of December 31, 2018 were approximately $2.7 billion for the year ending December 31, 2019, $4.7 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, $3.3 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023 and $3.8 billion in total for years thereafter.Total rent expense under operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines, was $765 million and $1.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, and was classified as Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Commitments

In September 2018, we signed a reciprocal long-term spectrum lease with Sprint. The lease includes an offsetting amount to be received from Sprint for the lease of our spectrum. Lease payments began in the fourth quarter of 2018. The minimum commitment under this lease as of June 30, 2019, is $509 million. The reciprocal long-term lease is a distinct transaction from the Merger.Under the previous lease standard certain of our network backhaul arrangements were accounted for as operating leases. Obligations under these agreements were included within our operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018.These agreements no longer qualify as leases under the new lease standard. Our commitments under these agreements as of June 30, 2019, were approximately $147 million for the year ending June 30, 2020, $242 million in total for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, $160 million in total for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, and $188 million in total for years thereafter.



Interest rate lock derivatives
In October 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. These interest rate lock derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges to reduce variability in cash flows due to changes in interest payments attributable to increases or decreases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of

26

fixed-rate debt. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives as of June 30, 2019, was a liability of $1.1 billion and is included in Other current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements for further information.

Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements
In April 2019, T-Mobile USA entered into a Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement (“REPA”) with a third party that is based on the expected operation of a solar photovoltaic electrical generation facility located in Texas and will remain in effect until the fifteenth anniversary of the facility’s entry into commercial operation. Commercial operation of the facility is expected to occur in July 2021. The REPA consists of an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility. We have determined that the REPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPA does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the REPA did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility, nor do we direct the use of, or receive specific energy output from, the facility.

Contingencies and Litigation

Litigation Matters

We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (“Litigation Matters”) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements but that is not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.


Note 13 – Subsequent Event

In July 2019, we entered into various agreements, including an amendment to the Business Combination Agreement, in connection with the Merger. See Note 3 – Business Combinations for further information.

Note 14 – Guarantor Financial Information

Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties issued by T-Mobile USA (“Issuer”) is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of the Issuer’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. The indentures and credit facilities governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of the indentures and the supplemental indentures.On October 23, 2018, SLMA LLC was formed as a limited liability company in Delaware to serve as an escrow subsidiary to facilitate the contemplated issuance of notes by Parent in connection with the Transactions. SLMA LLC is an indirect, 100% owned finance subsidiary of Parent, as such term is used in Rule 3-10(b) of Regulation S-X, and has been designated as an unrestricted subsidiary under the Issuer’s existing debt securities. Any debt securities that may be issued from time to time by SLMA LLC will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Parent.Presented below is the condensed consolidating financial information as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

•the occurrence of events that may give rise to a right of one or both of the parties to terminate the Business Combination Agreement; •adverse effects on the market price of our common stock or on our operating results because of a failure to complete the Merger in the anticipated timeframe, on the anticipated terms or at all;

•the inability of us, Sprint or the combined company to retain and hire key personnel; •the risk that certain contractual restrictions contained in the Business Combination Agreement during the pendency of the Transactions could adversely affect our or Sprint’s ability to pursue business opportunities or strategic transactions; •adverse economic, political or market conditions in the U.S. and international markets; •competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers; •the effects of any future merger, investment, or acquisition involving us, as well as the effects of mergers, investments, or acquisitions in the technology, media and telecommunications industry; •challenges in implementing our business strategies or funding our operations, including payment for additional spectrum or network upgrades; •the possibility that we may be unable to renew our spectrum licenses on attractive terms or acquire new spectrum licenses at reasonable costs and terms; •difficulties in managing growth in wireless data services, including network quality;

Business Overview

In April 2019, we introduced TVisionTM Home, a rebranded and upgraded version of Layer3 TV. TVisionTM Home delivers what customers want most from high-end home TV, including a premium TV experience and HD and 4K channels. TVisionTM Home launched in eight markets. In April 2019, we launched T-Mobile MONEY nationwide, offering customers a no-fee, interest-earning, mobile-first checking account which can be opened and managed from customers’ smartphones. Accounts are held at BankMobile, a Division of Customers Bank.


Magenta Plans

In June 2019, we rebranded our T-Mobile ONE and ONE Plus plans to Magenta and Magenta Plus. The Magenta plan adds 3GB of high-speed smartphone hotspot, or tethering, per line and unlimited 3G tethering thereafter and includes a Netflix Basic subscription for customers with family plans. The Magenta Plus plan benefits remain the same as the ONE Plus plan and includes a Netflix Standard subscription for customers with family plans.

Proposed Sprint Transaction

On April 29, 2018, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement to merge with Sprint in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock. The combined company will be named “T-Mobile” and, as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to rapidly launch a broad and deep nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. Immediately following the Merger, it is anticipated that Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”) and SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) will hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 41.7% and 27.4%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 30.9% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders, based on closing share prices and certain other assumptions as of December 31, 2018. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive final federal regulatory approval in the third quarter of 2019 and currently anticipate that the Merger will be permitted to close in the second half of the year.

For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, see Note 3 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

T-Mobile was added to the S&P 500 Index effective prior to the open of trading on July 15, 2019. We were added to the S&P 500 GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Wireless Telecommunication Services Sub-Industry index.

Performance Measures

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

Total Customers

A customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, DIGITS or connected devices which includes tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE™, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and MVNO customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile branded prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) partner. Upon the effective date, the agreement resulted in a base adjustment to reduce branded prepaid customers by 616,000 as we will no longer actively support the branded product offering. Prospectively, new customer activity associated with these products will be recorded within wholesale customers and revenue for these customers will be recorded within wholesale revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers:

Total branded net customer additions increased 131,000, or 12%, for the three months ended and increased 15,000, or 1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily from:•Higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions from connected devices and lower churn;•Higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to lower churn, partially offset by the impact of continued promotional activities in the marketplace; and•Higher branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to record-low churn.The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily from:•Higher branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to record-low churn; and•Higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions from connected devices, partially offset by higher deactivations from a growing customer base; partially offset by•Lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to continued promotional activities in the marketplace, partially offset by lower churn.





Wholesale

Wholesale net customer additions increased 41,000, or 9%, for the three months ended and increased 374,000, or 53%, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to higher gross additions from the continued success of our M2M and MVNO partnerships.

Customers Per Account

Customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone customers and branded postpaid other customers which includes DIGITS and connected devices such as tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE™. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base.The following table sets forth the branded postpaid customers per account:

June 30, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change# %Branded postpaid customers per account3.08 2.97 0.11 4%

Branded postpaid customers per account increased 4% primarily from continued growth of new customer segments and rate plans such as Unlimited 55+, Military, Business and Essentials, promotional activities targeting families and the continued success of connected devices and wearables.

Churn

Churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

The following table sets forth the churn:

Branded postpaid phone churn decreased 17 basis points for the three months ended and decreased 18 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily from increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, industry-leading customer service and the overall value of our offerings. Branded prepaid churn decreased 32 basis points for the three months ended and decreased 20 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the continued success of our prepaid brands due to promotional activities and rate plan offers as well as increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality.

Average Revenue Per User

ARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes Branded postpaid other customers and related revenues which includes DIGITS and connected devices such as tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE™.The following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPU and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:

Branded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $0.42, or 1%, for the three months ended and $0.50, or 1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to:•A reduction in regulatory program revenues from the continued adoption of tax inclusive plans; •The ongoing growth in our Netflix offering, which totaled $0.61 for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased branded postpaid phone ARPU by $0.30 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018;•A reduction in certain non-recurring charges; and •The growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as Unlimited 55+, Military, Business and Essentials; partially offset by•Higher premium services revenue.The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to: •A reduction in regulatory program revenues from the continued adoption of tax inclusive plans; •The ongoing growth in our Netflix offering, which totaled $0.56 for the six months ended June 30, 2019, and decreased branded postpaid phone ARPU by $0.28 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018; and•A reduction in certain non-recurring charges; partially offset by•Higher premium services revenue.We continue to expect Branded postpaid phone ARPU in full-year 2019 to remain generally stable within a range from plus 1% to minus 1%, compared to full-year 2018.






Branded Prepaid ARPU

Branded prepaid ARPU decreased $1.02, or 3%, for the three months ended and $1.13, or 3%, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to:•Dilution from promotional rate plans; and•Growth in our Amazon Prime offering - included as a benefit with certain Metro by T-Mobile unlimited rate plans as of Q4 2018 - which impacted prepaid ARPU by $0.47 for the three months ended June 30, 2019; partially offset by •An increase in certain non-recurring charges. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to: •Dilution from promotional rate plans; and•Growth in our Amazon Prime offering - included as a benefit with certain Metro by T-Mobile unlimited rate plans as of Q4 2018 - which impacted prepaid ARPU by $0.39 for the six months ended June 30, 2019; partially offset by •An increase in certain non-recurring charges.





Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our operating performance. Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs and costs related to the Transactions, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities with DT. Upon consummation of the Transactions, we will incur substantial third-party indebtedness which will increase our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments on higher total indebtedness, and may adversely impact our liquidity. Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy.

Cash Flows

The following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $886 million, or 70%, for the three months ended and $1.5 billion, or 74%, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily from:•A $817 million decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use from Accounts receivable, Other current and long-term assets, Equipment installment plan receivables and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and•A $157 million increase in Net income.•A $1.0 billion decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use from Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other current and long-term liabilities, partially offset by higher use from inventories; and•A $394 million increase in Net income.Changes in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Short and long-term operating lease liabilities are now presented in Changes in operating assets and liabilities due to the adoption of the new lease standard. The net impact of changes in these accounts decreased Net cash provided by operating activities by $52 million and $139 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.

Borrowing Capacity and Debt Financing

As of June 30, 2019, our total debt was $25.2 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $24.9 billion was classified as long-term debt.Effective April 28, 2019, we redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of our DT Senior Reset Notes. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.666% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and were paid on April 29, 2019. The redemption premium was $28 million and was included in Other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Certain components of the reset features were required to be bifurcated from the DT Senior Reset Notes and were separately accounted for as embedded derivatives. The write-off of embedded derivatives upon redemption resulted in a gain of $11 million which was included in Other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements for further information.We maintain a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with DT which is comprised of a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement, with a maturity date of December 29, 2021. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.We maintain a handset financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG (“Deutsche Bank”), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance.We maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. As of June 30, 2019, there was $300 million in outstanding borrowings under the vendor financing agreements. As of December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance.

Consents on Debt

In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, DT and T-Mobile USA entered into a financing matters agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018, pursuant to which DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to DT. There was no payment accrued as of June 30, 2019.On May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement dated as of May 14, 2018, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to certain existing debt of us and our subsidiaries. If the Merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to third-party note holders. There was no payment accrued as of June 30, 2019.See Note 3 - Business Combinations for further information.



Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity

We may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2019, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of June 30, 2019.



Financing Lease Facilities

We have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of June 30, 2019, we have committed to $3.4 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $316 million and $407 million was executed during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. We expect to enter into up to an additional $493 million in financing lease commitments during 2019.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


Capital Expenditures

Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build-out of our network to utilize our 600 MHz spectrum licenses. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, to be at the very high end of the range of $5.4 to $5.7 billion and cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, to be at the very high end of the range of $5.8 to $6.1 billion in 2019. This includes expenditures for the continued deployment of 600 MHz and laying the groundwork for 5G deployment. This does not include property and equipment obtained through financing lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.

Share Repurchases

On December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2018 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). Repurchased shares are retired. The 2017 Stock Repurchase Program completed on April 29, 2018.On April 27, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the total stock repurchase program to $9.0 billion, consisting of the $1.5 billion in repurchases previously completed and up to an additional $7.5 billion of repurchases of our common stock. The additional $7.5 billion repurchase authorization is contingent upon the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and the abandonment of the Transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement.


Dividends

We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock.


Related Party Transactions

We have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.

Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the three months ended June 30, 2019, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with DT. We have relied upon DT for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: MTN Irancell, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2019, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to Telecommunication Company of Iran and to three customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Bank Sepah, and Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.In addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of June 30, 2019, we derecognized net receivables of $2.6 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.The policy below is critical because it requires management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.



Leases

We adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded.

Significant Judgments:

The most significant judgments and impacts upon adoption of the standard include the following:•In evaluating contracts to determine if they qualify as a lease, we consider factors such as if we have obtained or transferred substantially all of the rights to the underlying asset through exclusivity, if we can or if we have transferred the ability to direct the use of the asset by making decisions about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor has substantive substitution rights. •We recognized right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded. The lease liability for operating leases is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. The right-of-use asset for operating leases is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amounts such as prepaid rent and deferred rent which we remeasured at adoption due to the application of hindsight to our lease term estimates. Deferred and prepaid rent will no longer be presented separately. •Capital lease assets previously included within Property and equipment, net, were reclassified to financing lease right-of-use assets and capital lease liabilities previously included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt were reclassified to financing lease liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. •Certain line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the “Supplementary disclosure of cash flow information” have been renamed to align with the new terminology presented in the new lease standard; “Repayment of capital lease obligations” is now presenting as “Repayments of financing lease obligations” and “Assets acquired under capital lease obligations” is now presenting as “Financing lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations.” In the “Operating Activities” section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we have added “Operating lease right-of-use assets” and “Short and long-term operating lease liabilities” which represent the change in the operating lease asset and liability, respectively. Additionally, in the “Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information” section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we have added “Operating lease payments,” and in the “Noncash investing and financing activities” section we have added “Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations.”•In determining the discount rate used to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability, we use rates implicit in the lease, or if not readily available, we use our incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of a risk-free LIBOR rate plus a credit spread as secured by our assets.•Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation was incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. •We elected the use of hindsight whereby we applied current lease term assumptions that are applied to new leases in determining the expected lease term period for all cell sites. Upon adoption of the new lease standard and application of hindsight our expected lease term has shortened to reflect payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only. This assessment corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases and aligns with the payments that have been disclosed as lease commitments in prior years. As a result, the average remaining lease term for cell sites has decreased from approximately nine to five years based on lease contracts in effect at transition on January 1, 2019. The aggregate impact of using the hindsight is an estimated decrease in Total operating expense of $240 million in fiscal year 2019.•We were also required to reassess the previously failed sale-leasebacks of certain T-Mobile-owned wireless communication tower sites and determine whether the transfer of the assets to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criteria in the revenue standard and whether a sale should be recognized.•We concluded that a sale has not occurred for the 6,200 tower sites transferred to CCI pursuant to a master prepaid lease arrangement; therefore, these sites will continue to be accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks. •We concluded that a sale should be recognized for the 900 tower sites transferred to CCI pursuant to the sale of a subsidiary and for the 500 tower sites transferred to PTI. Upon adoption on January 1, 2019 we derecognized our existing long-term financial obligation and the tower-related property and equipment associated with these 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites and recognized a lease liability and right-of-use asset for the leaseback of the tower sites. The estimated impacts from the change in accounting conclusion are primarily a decrease in Other revenues of $44 million and a decrease in Interest expense of $34 million in fiscal year 2019.•Rental revenues and expenses associated with co-location tower sites are presented on a net basis under the new lease standard. These revenues and expenses were presented on a gross basis under the former lease standard.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q.The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this Form 10-Q.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.


PART II. OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings

See Note 3 - Business Combinations and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.


Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-Q, the Risk Factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the following risk factors, should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.

Risks Related to the Proposed Transactions

The closing of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of approvals from various governmental entities, which may not approve the Transactions, may delay the approvals for, or may impose conditions or restrictions on, jeopardize or delay completion of, or reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of, the Transactions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transactions will not be completed.

The completion of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, obtaining certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the receipt of required approvals from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and certain state and territorial public utility commissions or similar state and foreign regulatory bodies, and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the Transactions or any legal requirements enacted by a court or other governmental entity preventing the completion of the Transactions. In connection with these required approvals, we have agreed to significant actions and conditions, including the planned divestiture of Sprint’s prepaid wireless businesses to DISH Network Corporation and ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements to be entered into in connection with such divestiture, which we and Sprint announced on July 26, 2019 (the “Divestiture Transaction”), a stipulation and order and proposed final judgment with the U.S. Department of Justice, which we and Sprint announced on July 26, 2019 (the “Consent Decree”), the proposed commitments contained in the ex parte presentation filed with the Secretary of the FCC, which we and Sprint announced on May 20, 2019 (the “FCC Commitments”) and any other commitments or undertakings we may enter into with governmental authorities at the federal and state level (collectively, with the Consent Decree and the FCC Commitments, the “Government Commitments”). There is no assurance that the remaining required authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals will be obtained or that they will be obtained in a timely manner, or whether they will be subject to additional required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions on the combined company’s business, operations or assets. In addition, the attorneys general of thirteen states and the District of Columbia have commenced litigation seeking an order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions. Such litigation, and such required actions, conditions, limitations and restrictions, may jeopardize or delay completion of the Transactions, reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the Transactions or allow the parties to the Business Combination Agreement to terminate the Business Combination Agreement, which could result in a material adverse effect on our or the combined company’s business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, the completion of the Transactions is also subject to T-Mobile USA having specified minimum credit ratings on the closing date of the Transactions (after giving effect to the Merger) from at least two of three specified credit rating agencies, subject to certain qualifications. In the event that we terminate the Business Combination Agreement in connection with a failure to satisfy the closing condition related to the specified minimum credit ratings, then in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Sprint an amount equal to $600 million. If the Transactions are not completed by November 1, 2019 (or, if the Marketing Period (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) has started and is in effect at such date, then January 2, 2020)), or if there is a final and non-appealable order or injunction preventing the consummation of the Transactions, either we or Sprint may terminate the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement may also be terminated if the other conditions to closing are not satisfied, and we and Sprint may also mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination Agreement.

Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact us and our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations.

If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Transactions must be paid by us whether or not the Transactions are completed. Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers, dealers and others who deal with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, it is expected that if the Merger is not completed, we will continue to lack the network, scale and financial resources of the current market share leaders in, and other companies that have more recently begun providing, wireless services. Further, if the Merger is not completed, it is expected that we will not be able to deploy a nationwide 5G network on the same scale and on the same timeline as the combined company, and therefore will continue to be limited in their respective abilities to compete effectively in the 5G era.

We are subject to various uncertainties, including litigation and contractual restrictions and requirements while the Transactions are pending that could disrupt our or the combined company’s business and adversely affect our or the combined company’s business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations.

Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, dealers and retailers may have an adverse effect on us or the combined company. These uncertainties may impair the ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Transactions and, if the Transactions are completed, for a period of time thereafter, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the combined company’s business following the completion of the Transactions could be negatively impacted. We or the combined company may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or the combined company or fail to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing for us or the combined company new products that are necessary for the operations of its business due to the uncertainty created by the Transactions. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Transactions.The Business Combination Agreement also restricts us, without Sprint’s consent, from taking certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business while the Transactions are pending, including, among other things, certain acquisitions or dispositions of businesses and assets, entering into or amending certain contracts, repurchasing or issuing securities, making capital expenditures and incurring indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted toward the completion of the Transactions. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Transactions. These costs could adversely affect our or the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters that arise from time to time, including the antitrust litigation related to the Transactions brought by the attorneys general of thirteen states and the District of Columbia, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters could prevent the consummation of the Transactions and/or adversely affect us and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the combined company.




The Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of our Board to pursue alternatives to the Transactions.

The Business Combination Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the completion of which would constitute an alternative transaction for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement does not permit us to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for, or to complete, such an alternative transaction.

Our directors and officers may have interests in the Transactions different from the interests of our stockholders.

Certain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders. These interests include, but are not limited to, the continued service of certain of our directors as directors of the combined company, the continued employment of certain of our executive officers by the combined company, severance agreements and amended employment terms and other rights held by our directors and executive officers, and provisions in the Business Combination Agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expenses to our directors and officers.

Risks Related to Integration and the Combined Company

Although we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame.

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company’s ability to integrate our and Sprint’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term to be fully realized. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

Our business and Sprint’s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including difficulties in completing the Divestiture Transaction, satisfying all of the Government Commitments and maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected following the Transactions. Revenues following the Transactions may be lower than expected.

The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining our and Sprint’s business practices and operations. This process, as well as the Divestiture Transaction and the Government Commitments, may disrupt our business. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining our and Sprint’s businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company. The overall combination of our and Sprint’s businesses, the completion of the Divestiture Transaction and the compliance with the Government Commitments may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies, completing the Divestiture Transaction and satisfying all of the Government Commitments include, among others:•the diversion of management attention to integration matters;•difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;•challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;•differences in control environments, cultures, and auditor expectations may result in future material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, and/or control deficiencies while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices;•alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices;•difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel;•challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•the impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the Transactions;•the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;•challenges in managing the divestiture process for the Divestiture Transaction and in conjunction with the ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements to be entered into in connection with the Divestiture Transaction;•difficulties in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required timeframes and the tracking and monitoring of them, including the network build-out obligations under the FCC Commitments; •contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and•potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Transactions, the Divestiture Transaction and the Government Commitments.Some of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our and Sprint’s businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected, including as a result of the Divestiture Transaction, the Government Commitments and/or the other actions and conditions we have agreed to in connection with the Transactions, or otherwise. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and Sprint’s businesses and in connection with the Divestiture Transaction and the Government Commitments, including potential penalties that could arise if we fail to fulfill our obligations thereunder. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the Merger, and negatively impact the price of our common stock following the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all.

The indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions will be substantially greater than the indebtedness of each of T-Mobile and Sprint on a standalone basis prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company’s business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs.

In connection with the Transactions, we and Sprint have conducted, and expect to conduct, certain pre-Merger financing transactions, which will be used in part to prepay a portion of our and Sprint’s existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity needs. After giving effect to the pre-Merger financing transactions and the Transactions, we anticipate that the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of up to approximately $69.0 billion to $71.0 billion, based on estimated June 30, 2019 debt and cash balances, and excluding tower obligations and operating lease liabilities.Our substantially increased indebtedness following the Transactions could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to meet interest payments. In addition, this increased level of indebtedness following the Transactions may reduce funds available to support efforts to combine our and Sprint’s businesses and realize the expected benefits of the Transactions, and may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities that may put the combined company at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, it may be necessary for the combined company to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in its debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with the capital structure of the combined company.


Because of the substantial indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions, there is a risk that the combined company may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms.

The ability of the combined company to service its substantial debt obligations following the Transactions will depend in part on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including the ability of the combined company to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations when due. If the combined company is unable to meet such obligations or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, it may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. The combined company may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations after the Transactions.Some or all of the combined company’s variable-rate indebtedness may use the LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness and other financings will include restrictive covenants that limit the combined company’s operating flexibility.

The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness and other financings will impose material operating and financial restrictions on the combined company. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, may limit the combined company’s ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities, including the following:•incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;•paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;•selling or buying assets, properties or licenses;•developing assets, properties or licenses which the combined company has or in the future may procure;•creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;•participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;•engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations or other transactions;•entering into transactions with affiliates; and•placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.These restrictions could limit the combined company’s ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on its outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in its operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the combined company’s debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving the combined company’s lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide it with further funds and to require the combined company to repay all amounts then outstanding.



The financing of the Transactions is not assured.

Although we have received debt financing commitments from lenders to provide various financing arrangements to facilitate the Transactions, the obligation of the lenders to provide these facilities is subject to a number of conditions and the financing of the Transactions may not be obtained on the expected terms or at all.In particular, we have received commitments for $30.0 billion in debt financing to fund the Transactions, which is comprised of (i) a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $7.0 billion term loan credit facility and (iii) a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. Our reliance on the financing from the $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility commitment is intended to be reduced through one or more secured note offerings or other long-term financings prior to the Merger closing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any such secured notes or other long-term financings on terms we find acceptable or at all, especially in light of the recent debt market volatility, in which case we may have to exercise some or all of the commitments under the secured bridge facility to fund the Transactions. Accordingly, the costs of financing for the Transactions may be higher than expected.


Credit rating downgrades could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company.

Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or, following the completion of the Transactions, obligations to the combined company’s obligors. Each rating agency reviews these ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in the rating of us and/or Sprint could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company.

We have incurred, and will incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Transactions.

We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the Transactions, the Divestiture Transaction and the compliance with the Government Commitments, and over a period of time following the completion of the Transactions, the combined company also expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating our and Sprint’s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. A portion of the transaction costs related to the Transactions will be incurred regardless of whether the Transactions are completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses will exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the Transactions and the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the Transactions.

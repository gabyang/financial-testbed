Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.The condensed consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to our obligations to pay for the management and operation of certain of our wireless communications tower sites. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Transactions

On May 8, 2024, we issued €2.0 billion of euro (“EUR”) denominated debt. T-Mobile’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar (“USD”). Each period, we convert activity and balances in EUR into USD using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period or spot exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of Other income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Derivative and Hedging Instruments

The Company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments, including cross-currency swaps. We designate certain derivatives as accounting hedge relationships. We do not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.We record derivatives on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize them as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Fair value is derived primarily from observable market data, and our derivatives are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.Cash flows associated with qualifying hedge derivative instruments are presented in the same category on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the item being hedged. For fair value hedges, other than foreign currency hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings through the same income statement line item as the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, as well as fair value foreign currency hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings, again, through the same income statement line item.



Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Segment Reporting Disclosures

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The standard expands reportable segment disclosure requirements for public business entities primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit (referred to as the “significant expense principle”). The standard will become effective for
9

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
us for our fiscal year 2024 annual financial statements and interim financial statements thereafter and will be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the financial statements, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us beginning in our fiscal year 2024 annual financial statements, and we expect the adoption of the standard will impact certain of our segment reporting disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The standard enhances income tax disclosure requirements for all entities by requiring specified categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation table, disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and providing clarification on uncertain tax positions and related financial statement impacts. The standard will be effective for us for our fiscal year 2025 annual financial statements with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us beginning in our fiscal year 2025 annual financial statements, and we expect the adoption of the standard will impact certain of our income tax disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Note 2 – Business Combinations

Acquisition of Ka’ena Corporation

On March 9, 2023, we entered into a Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement”) for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC (collectively, “Ka’ena”), for a maximum purchase price of $1.35 billion to be paid out 39% in cash and 61% in shares of T-Mobile common stock (the “Ka’ena Acquisition”). On March 13, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement, which amended, among other things, certain mechanics of the payment of the purchase consideration for the Ka’ena Acquisition, which resulted in a nominal increase in the percentage of cash compared to shares of T-Mobile common stock to be paid out as part of the total purchase price.Upon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, on May 1, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed the Ka’ena Acquisition, and as a result, Ka’ena became a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile. Concurrently and as agreed upon through the Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement, T-Mobile and Ka’ena entered into certain separate transactions, including the effective settlement of the preexisting wholesale arrangement between T-Mobile and Ka’ena and agreements with certain of the sellers to provide services to T-Mobile during the post-acquisition period.Ka’ena is a provider of prepaid mobile services in the U.S. through its primary brands, Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile, and also offers a selection of wireless devices, including handsets and other mobile communication devices. Prior to the Ka’ena Acquisition, Ka’ena was a wholesale partner of the Company for which we recognized service revenues within Wholesale and other service revenues on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and for which Ka’ena incurred related expenses for the use of our network. On the Acquisition Date, this relationship was effectively terminated, and the Company acquired Ka’ena’s prepaid customer relationships and began to recognize service revenues associated with these customers within Prepaid revenues and operating expenses primarily within Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income subsequent to the Acquisition Date. The Ka’ena Acquisition enhances the Company’s position as a leading prepaid wireless carrier by diversifying our brand identities, enhancing our distribution footprint and preserving the value of our relationship with Ka’ena through its acquisition, including the acquisition of its prepaid customer relationships.The financial results of Ka’ena from the Acquisition Date through September 30, 2024, were not material to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, nor were they material to our prior period consolidated results on a pro forma basis. Costs related to the Ka’ena Acquisition were not material to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.




Consideration Transferred

In accordance with the terms of the Merger and Unit Purchase Agreement, the total purchase price is variable, dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena, and consists of an upfront payment on the Acquisition Date and an earnout payable on August 1, 2026. The amount of the upfront payment is subject to customary adjustments and is expected to be finalized by the end of 2024.

10

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
On the Acquisition Date and in satisfaction of the upfront payment, we transferred $420 million in cash and 3,264,952 shares of T-Mobile common stock valued at $536 million as determined based on its closing market price on April 30, 2024, for a total payment fair value of $956 million. An additional amount of the upfront payment payable to certain sellers was deferred and may be paid through January 2026. As of the Acquisition Date, we recognized a liability of $27 million for the fair value of this deferred amount, which is included in the fair value of consideration transferred in the Ka’ena Acquisition. Furthermore, a portion of the upfront payment made on the Acquisition Date was for the settlement of the preexisting wholesale relationship with Ka’ena and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred in the Ka’ena Acquisition.Based on the amount of the upfront payment, up to an additional $403 million in future cash and T-Mobile common stock is payable in satisfaction of the earnout, dependent upon Ka’ena’s achievement of specified performance indicators.•$241 million of the potential earnout amount is payment for the acquired Ka’ena business. As of the Acquisition Date, we recognized a liability of $183 million for the fair value of such contingent consideration. This liability will be adjusted to fair value at each future reporting date until settled, with a corresponding offset recorded to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.•$162 million of the potential earnout amount is payment for services to be provided to T-Mobile by certain of the sellers during the post-acquisition period, as well as the replacement of equity awards of certain Ka’ena employees. We will record expenses as such services are provided during the post-acquisition period within Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding offset to Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.




The acquisition-date fair value of consideration transferred in the Ka’ena Acquisition totaled $1.2 billion, comprised of the following:
(in millions)May 1, 2024Fair value of T-Mobile common stock issued to Ka’ena stockholders related to the upfront payment$527 Fair value of cash paid to Ka’ena stockholders related to the upfront payment413 Fair value of contingent consideration183 Fair value of deferred consideration27 Total fair value of consideration exchanged$1,150

The fair value of contingent consideration related to the earnout was estimated using the income approach, a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, whereby a Monte Carlo simulation method estimated the probability of different outcomes. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and, therefore, represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The key assumptions in applying the income approach for the contingent consideration include forecasted Ka’ena financial information, primarily revenue, marketing costs and customer metrics, the probability of achieving the forecasted financial information and the discount rate.As of September 30, 2024, $195 million of liabilities for contingent consideration and $55 million of liabilities for post-acquisition services were presented within Other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.


Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

We have accounted for the Ka’ena Acquisition as a business combination. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ka’ena were recorded at their provisionally assigned fair values as of the Acquisition Date and consolidated with those of T-Mobile. Assigning fair values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Acquisition Date requires the use of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. For the provisionally assigned fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we used the cost and income approaches.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The following table summarizes the provisionally assigned fair values for each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Acquisition Date. We retained the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning values to certain acquired assets. We are in the process of finalizing the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including income tax-related amounts. Therefore, the provisionally assigned fair values set forth below are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained and the valuations are completed.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill with a provisionally assigned value of $781 million represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The provisionally assigned goodwill recognized includes expected growth in customers and service revenues to be achieved from the operations of the combined company, the assembled workforce of Ka’ena and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Of the total provisionally assigned amount of goodwill resulting from the Ka’ena Acquisition of $781 million, the preliminary amount deductible for tax purposes is $90 million. All of the goodwill acquired is allocated to the Wireless reporting unit.Other intangible assets acquired primarily include $545 million of customer relationships with an estimated weighted-average useful life of six years, $70 million of tradenames with an estimated weighted-average useful life of eight years and $125 million of other intangible assets with an estimated weighted-average useful life of four years. The customer relationships are being amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over their estimated useful lives, and the tradenames are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.The preliminary fair value of customer relationships was estimated using the income approach. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and, therefore, represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The key assumptions in applying the income approach include forecasted subscriber churn rates, revenue over an estimated period of time, the discount rate and estimated income taxes.



UScellular Wireless Operations

On May 24, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with United States Cellular Corporation (“UScellular”), Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, we will acquire substantially all of UScellular’s wireless operations and select spectrum assets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.4 billion, payable in cash and the assumption of up to $2.0 billion of debt through an exchange offer to be made to certain UScellular debtholders prior to closing. To the extent any debtholders do not participate in the exchange, their bonds will continue as obligations of UScellular, and the cash portion of the purchase price will be correspondingly increased. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Upon closing of the transaction, we expect to account for the UScellular transaction as a business combination and to consolidate the acquired operations.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Following the closing of the transaction, UScellular will retain ownership of its other spectrum, as well as its towers. Subject to the closing of the transaction, we will enter into a 15-year master license agreement to lease space on at least 2,100 towers being retained and to extend our tenancy term on approximately 600 towers where we are already leasing space from UScellular for 15 years post-closing. We estimate the incremental future minimum lease payments associated with the master license agreement will be $1.4 billion over 15 years post-closing.


Note 3 – Joint Ventures

Lumos and Metronet Joint Ventures

On April 24, 2024, we entered into a merger agreement with a fund operated by EQT, Infrastructure VI fund (“Fund VI”), for the joint acquisition by us and Fund VI of Lumos (“Lumos”), a fiber-to-the-home platform, from EQT’s predecessor fund, EQT Infrastructure III. The Lumos joint acquisition is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, we expect to invest approximately $950 million in the joint venture to acquire a 50% equity interest and all existing Lumos fiber customers. The funds invested by us will be used by the joint venture to fund future fiber builds. In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to make an additional capital contribution of approximately $500 million in 2027 or 2028 for the existing business plan. On July 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with KKR & Co. Inc. (“KKR”) to establish a joint venture to acquire Metronet Holdings, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Metronet”), a fiber-to-the-home platform. This arrangement is expected to close in 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, we expect to invest approximately $4.9 billion in the joint venture to acquire a 50% equity interest and all existing residential fiber customers, as well as funding the joint venture. We do not anticipate making further capital contributions following the closing for the existing business plan. Upon closing of the transactions, we expect to account for the Lumos and Metronet joint ventures under the equity method of accounting and recognize service revenues for the acquired Lumos and Metronet fiber customers and wholesale costs paid to the joint ventures for network access within Cost of services on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.




Note 4 – Receivables and Related Allowance for Credit Losses

We maintain an allowance for credit losses by applying an expected credit loss model. Each period, management assesses the appropriateness of the level of allowance for credit losses by considering credit risk inherent within each portfolio segment as of the end of the period.We consider a receivable past due when a customer has not paid us by the contractually specified payment due date. Account balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible (customer default), based on factors such as customer credit ratings as well as the length of time the amounts are past due.Our portfolio of receivables is comprised of two portfolio segments: accounts receivable and equipment installment plan (“EIP”) receivables.



Accounts Receivable Portfolio Segment

Accounts receivable balances are predominately comprised of amounts currently due from customers (e.g., for wireless communications services), device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, other carriers and third-party retail channels.We estimate credit losses associated with our accounts receivable portfolio segment using an expected credit loss model, which utilizes an aging schedule methodology based on historical information and is adjusted for asset-specific considerations, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.Our approach considers a number of factors, including our overall historical credit losses and payment experience, as well as current collection trends such as write-off frequency and severity. We also consider other qualitative factors such as current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.



13

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
We consider the need to adjust our estimate of credit losses for reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions. To do so, we monitor external forecasts of changes in real U.S. gross domestic product and forecasts of consumer credit behavior for comparable credit exposures.

EIP Receivables Portfolio Segment

Based upon customer credit profiles at the time of customer origination, as well as subsequent credit performance, we classify the EIP receivables segment into two customer classes of “Prime” and “Subprime.” Prime customer receivables are those with lower credit risk, and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher credit risk. Customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases if their assessed credit risk exceeds established underwriting thresholds. In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category may be required to pay a deposit.To determine a customer’s credit profile and assist in determining their credit class, we use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer leveraging several factors, such as credit bureau information and consumer credit risk scores, as well as service and device plan characteristics.EIP receivables had a combined weighted-average effective interest rate of 11.2% and 10.6% as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.



The following table summarizes the EIP receivables, including imputed discounts and related allowance for credit losses:
(in millions)September 30,2024December 31,2023EIP receivables, gross$6,052 $7,271 Unamortized imputed discount(437)(505)EIP receivables, net of unamortized imputed discount5,615 6,766 Allowance for credit losses(268)(268)EIP receivables, net of allowance for credit losses and imputed discount$5,347 $6,498 Classified on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as:Equipment installment plan receivables, net of allowance for credit losses and imputed discount$3,595 $4,456 Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net of allowance for credit losses and imputed discount1,752 2,042 EIP receivables, net of allowance for credit losses and imputed discount$5,347 $6,498

Many of our loss estimation techniques rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of our allowance for credit losses for EIP receivables. We manage our EIP receivables portfolio segment using delinquency and customer credit class as key credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the amortized cost of our EIP receivables by delinquency status, customer credit class and year of origination as of September 30, 2024:

We estimate credit losses on our EIP receivables segment by applying an expected credit loss model, which relies on historical loss data adjusted for current conditions to calculate default probabilities or an estimate for the frequency of customer default. Our assessment of default probabilities or frequency includes receivables delinquency status, historical loss experience, how long the receivables have been outstanding and customer credit ratings, as well as customer tenure. We multiply these estimated default probabilities by our estimated loss given default, which is the estimated amount of default or the severity of loss.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
As we do for our accounts receivable portfolio segment, we consider the need to adjust our estimate of credit losses on EIP receivables for reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions through monitoring external forecasts and periodic internal statistical analyses.

The following table presents write-offs of our EIP receivables by year of origination for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures

We do not have material off-balance-sheet credit exposures as of September 30, 2024. In connection with the sales of certain service accounts receivable and EIP receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. See Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.


Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables

We regularly enter into transactions to sell certain service accounts receivable and EIP receivables. The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our condensed consolidated financial statements, are described below.

Sales of EIP Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis (the “EIP Sale Arrangement”), which has been revised and extended from time to time. As of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the EIP Sale Arrangement provided funding of $1.3 billion.In connection with this EIP Sale Arrangement, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “EIP BRE”). We consolidate the EIP BRE under the VIE model.


The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consist primarily of the deferred purchase price, included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to the EIP BRE:

Sales of Service Accounts Receivable

Overview of the Transaction

In 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis (the “Service Receivable Sale Arrangement”), which has been revised and extended from time to time. On February 27, 2024, we extended the scheduled expiration date of the Service Receivable Sale Arrangement to February 25, 2025. As of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Service Receivable Sale Arrangement provided funding of $775 million. In connection with the Service Receivable Sale Arrangement, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity, to sell service accounts receivable (the “Service BRE”). We consolidate the Service BRE under the VIE model.


The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consist primarily of the deferred purchase price, and liabilities included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to the Service BRE:

Sales of Receivables

The following table summarizes the impact of the sale of certain service accounts receivable and EIP receivables on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

At inception, we elected to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our deferred purchase price related to the sales of service accounts receivable and EIP receivables was $626 million and $658 million, respectively.We recognized losses from sales of receivables, including changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price, of $23 million and $46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $69 million and $135 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 22, 2024, we executed an amendment to the EIP Sale Arrangement and an amendment to the Service Receivable Sale Arrangement (together, the “Pledge Amendments”). Currently, the credit enhancement feature of each of the EIP Sale Arrangement and the Service Receivable Sale Arrangement consists of additional receivables sold in excess of the funding commitments and such additional receivables are represented by a deferred purchase price for each arrangement, consisting of a receivable from the purchasers that entitles us to certain collections on the receivables.



16

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Pursuant to the Pledge Amendments, effective on November 1, 2024, the credit enhancement feature of each arrangement will instead consist of such additional receivables pledged to the purchasers instead of sold. Following the effective date of the Pledge Amendments, all cash proceeds associated with the sale of such receivables, a portion of which is currently recognized as Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions within Net cash used in investing activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, will be recognized as operating cash flows. In addition, the Pledge Amendment for the EIP Sale Arrangement also extends the scheduled expiry date of such arrangement to November 18, 2025.

Continuing Involvement

Pursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service accounts receivables and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables, are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where a write-off is imminent, and may be responsible for absorbing credit losses through reduced collections on our deferred purchase price assets. We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales. At the direction of the purchasers of the sold receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures while servicing the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers.


Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is as follows:
(in millions)GoodwillBalance as of December 31, 2023, net of accumulated impairment losses of $10,984$12,234 Preliminary goodwill from the Ka’ena Acquisition in 2024781 Balance as of September 30, 2024, net of accumulated impairment losses of $10,984$13,015

Spectrum Licenses

Cash payments to acquire spectrum licenses and payments for costs to clear spectrum are included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Spectrum Transactions

In September 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) announced that we were the winning bidder of 7,156 licenses in Auction 108 (2.5 GHz spectrum) for an aggregate price of $304 million. At inception of Auction 108 in June 2022, we deposited $65 million. We paid the FCC the remaining $239 million for the licenses won in the auction in September 2022. On February 29, 2024, the FCC issued to us the licenses won in Auction 108, and substantially all of these licenses were deployed in March 2024. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024.

Spectrum Exchange Transactions

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gains associated with the closing of certain spectrum exchange transactions of $10 million and $57 million, respectively, as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There were no gains and losses associated with spectrum exchange transactions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

17

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
As of September 30, 2024, $1.0 billion of spectrum licenses were classified as held for sale within Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to spectrum exchange agreements pending regulatory approval and closing, which are expected to close in the next twelve months. The closings of these transactions are not expected to have a significant impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 15, 2024, we closed on an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain of our 39 GHz spectrum licenses for certain of their 24 GHz spectrum licenses. We expect to record the spectrum licenses received at their estimated fair values of $985 million and recognize an associated gain of $137 million as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.


License Purchase Agreements

DISH Network Corporation

On July 1, 2020, we and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”) entered into a license purchase agreement (the “DISH License Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which DISH agreed to purchase certain 800 MHz spectrum licenses for a total of approximately $3.6 billion. On October 15, 2023, we and DISH entered into an amendment (the “LPA Amendment”) to the DISH License Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the parties agreed that (1) DISH will pay us a $100 million non-refundable extension fee (in lieu of the approximately $72 million termination fee that had previously been agreed to), (2) the closing for the purchase of the spectrum licenses by DISH will occur no later than April 1, 2024, (3) if DISH has not purchased the spectrum licenses by such date for any reason (including failure to receive the required FCC approval prior to such date), then the DISH License Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate, and we will retain the $100 million extension fee, (4) if DISH does purchase the spectrum by April 1, 2024, the $100 million extension fee will be credited against the $3.6 billion purchase price, and (5) we are permitted to commence auction of the spectrum prior to April 1, 2024 at our discretion (and subject to DISH’s purchase right). The LPA Amendment was approved by the Court and became effective on October 23, 2023. On October 25, 2023, we received a payment of $100 million from DISH for the extension fee and recorded a corresponding liability within Other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.DISH did not purchase the 800 MHz spectrum by April 1, 2024. As such, we recognized a gain for the $100 million extension fee previously paid by DISH during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, within Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and relieved the liability that was initially recorded upon receipt of the payment. On October 1, 2024, we concluded the auction process for the disposition of the spectrum as required under the final judgment agreed to by us, Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), Sprint LLC, SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) and DISH with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was approved by the Court on April 1, 2020, to offer the licenses for sale. We did not receive a qualifying bid and have been relieved of the obligation to sell the spectrum licenses. We are currently exploring alternatives to sell or utilize the spectrum licenses.


Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC

On August 8, 2022, we, Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC (together with Channel 51 License Co LLC, the “Sellers”) entered into License Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from the Sellers in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The licenses will be acquired without any associated networks and are currently being utilized by us through exclusive leasing arrangements with the Sellers.On March 30, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we and the Sellers agreed to separate the transaction into two tranches of licenses, with the closings on the acquisitions of certain licenses in Chicago, Dallas and New Orleans being deferred in order to potentially expedite the regulatory approval process for the remainder of the licenses. Subsequently, on August 25, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amendments No. 1 to the Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements, which deferred the closings of certain additional licenses in Chicago and Dallas into the second closing tranche. Together, the licenses with closings deferred into the second closing tranche represent $1.1 billion of the aggregate $3.5 billion cash consideration. The licenses being acquired by us, and the total consideration being paid for the licenses, remain the same under the original License Purchase Agreements and subsequent amendments.The FCC approved the purchase of the first tranche on December 29, 2023. The first tranche closed on June 24, 2024, and the associated payment of $2.4 billion was made on August 5, 2024.


18

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 22, 2024, the FCC approved the purchase of the Dallas licenses included in the second tranche. We expect the closing on the Dallas licenses and the associated payment of $541 million to occur in December 2024.We anticipate that the closing on the remaining deferred licenses in the second tranche will occur in 2025.The parties have agreed that each of the closings will occur within 180 days after the receipt of the applicable required regulatory approvals, and payment of each portion of the aggregate $3.5 billion purchase price will occur no later than 40 days after the date of each respective closing.



N77 License Co LLC

On September 10, 2024, we entered into a license purchase agreement with N77 License Co LLC (“Buyer”), pursuant to which Buyer has the option to purchase all or a portion of our remaining 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses in exchange for a range of cash consideration, with the specific licenses sold to be determined based upon the amount of committed financing raised by Buyer. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the licenses subject to the license purchase agreement were held at cost of $2.7 billion in Spectrum licenses on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We maintain the right to terminate the license purchase agreement no later than February 7, 2025, after our receipt of written notice of committed financing as of December 9, 2024, if the Buyer’s committed financing is less than a certain target level of cash consideration. The transaction is subject to FCC approval. We do not expect the transaction to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, such as exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship to mitigate fluctuations in values or cash flows related to such risks caused by foreign currency or interest rate volatility. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Cash flows associated with qualifying hedge derivative instruments are presented in the same category on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the item being hedged. For fair value hedges, other than foreign currency hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings through the same income statement line item as the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, as well as fair value foreign currency hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings, again, through the same income statement line item.We record derivatives on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value that is derived primarily from observable market data, including exchange rates, interest rates and forward curves. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to derivative valuations are generally observable in active markets and, as such, are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.



Cross-Currency Swaps

We enter into cross-currency swaps to offset changes in value of our payments on foreign-denominated debt in USD and to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.On April 30, 2024, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements, with the same notional amounts as the EUR-denominated debt issuance on May 8, 2024, to effectively convert €2.0 billion to USD borrowings, with the same maturities of five, eight and 12 years. The swaps qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges of our EUR-denominated debt, mitigating our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses.Accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the swaps will be initially recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to earnings in an amount that exactly offsets the periodic transaction gain or loss on remeasuring the debt, such that there will be no earnings volatility due to changes in foreign-currency exchange rates. Transaction gains or losses on remeasuring the EUR-denominated debt, as well as the offsetting swap amounts, are recorded within Other income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.Changes in the fair value of the swaps may be different from the current period transaction gain or loss on remeasurement of the debt, in which case the difference will remain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These differences generally represent credit or liquidity risk, referred to as a basis spread, and the time value of money (“excluded components”). The value of the excluded components is recognized in earnings using a systematic and rational method by accruing the current-period swap settlements into Interest expense, net, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If an amount remains in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets upon settlement of the derivative, those amounts will be reclassified to earnings at that time.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized pre-tax gains of $68 million and $21 million, respectively, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the fair value changes of these swaps. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $84 million and $77 million, respectively, of the amount recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was reclassified to Other income, net, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income to exactly offset the related pre-tax foreign currency transaction loss on the underlying EUR-denominated debt.

Interest Rate Lock Derivatives

Aggregate changes in the fair value of our interest rate lock derivatives, which were terminated in April 2020, of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion are presented in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $59 million and $55 million, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $175 million and $163 million, respectively, were amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Interest expense, net, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We expect to amortize $250 million of the Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the derivatives into Interest expense, net, over the 12 months ending September 30, 2025.


Deferred Purchase Price Assets

In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. See Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.The carrying amounts of our deferred purchase price assets, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $626 million and $658 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.


Debt

The fair values of our Senior Notes and spectrum-backed Senior Secured Notes to third parties were determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. Accordingly, our Senior Notes and spectrum-backed Senior Secured Notes to third parties were classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our Senior Notes to affiliates was determined based on a discounted cash flow approach using market interest rates of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for our standalone credit risk. Accordingly, our Senior Notes to affiliates were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our Senior Notes to third parties (EUR-denominated) and asset-backed notes (“ABS Notes”) was primarily based on quoted prices in inactive markets for identical instruments and observable changes in market interest rates, both of which are Level 2 inputs. Accordingly, our Senior Notes to third parties (EUR-denominated) and ABS Notes were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Although we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Notes to third parties (EUR-denominated), Senior Notes to affiliates and ABS Notes. The fair value estimates were based on information available as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange.

Asset-backed Notes

On February 14, 2024, we issued $500 million of 5.050% Class A Senior ABS Notes to third parties in a private placement transaction. These ABS Notes are secured by $658 million of gross EIP receivables and future collections on such receivables. Net proceeds of $497 million from these ABS Notes are presented in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.As of September 30, 2024, $1.3 billion of our ABS Notes were secured in total by $1.6 billion of gross EIP receivables and future collections on such receivables. Our ABS Notes and the assets securing this debt are included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.


The expected maturities of our ABS Notes as of September 30, 2024, were as follows:
(in millions)Expected Maturities2024$198 2025552 2026459 202741 Total$1,250

Variable Interest Entities

In connection with our ABS Notes issuances, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “ABS BRE”), and a trust (the “ABS Trust” and together with the ABS BRE, the “ABS Entities”), in which the ABS BRE holds a residual interest. Each of the ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary, as we have the power to direct the activities of the ABS Entities that most significantly impact their performance. Accordingly, we include the balances and results of operations of the ABS Entities in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to the ABS Entities:

See Note 4 – Receivables and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on the EIP receivables used to secure the ABS Notes.Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 9, 2024, we issued $500 million of 4.250% Class A Senior ABS Notes to third parties in a private placement transaction for net proceeds of approximately $498 million. These ABS Notes are secured by $668 million of gross EIP receivables and future collections on such receivables. The expected maturities of these ABS notes are $136 million due 2026 and $364 million due 2027.


Restricted Cash

Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. See Note 14 – Additional Financial Information for our reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash.

Note 9 – Tower Obligations

Existing CCI Tower Lease Arrangements

In 2012, we conveyed to Crown Castle International Corp. (“CCI”) the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,200 tower sites (“CCI Lease Sites”) via a master prepaid lease with site lease terms ranging from 23 to 37 years. CCI has fixed-price purchase options for the CCI Lease Sites totaling approximately $2.0 billion, exercisable annually on a per-tranche basis at the end of the lease term during the period from December 31, 2035, through December 31, 2049. If CCI exercises its purchase option for any tranche, it must purchase all the towers in the tranche. We lease back a portion of the space at certain tower sites.Assets and liabilities associated with the operation of the tower sites were transferred to special purpose entities (“SPEs”). Assets included ground lease agreements or deeds for the land on which the towers are situated, the towers themselves and existing subleasing agreements with other mobile network operator tenants that lease space at the tower sites. Liabilities included the obligation to pay ground lease rentals, property taxes and other executory costs.We determined the SPEs containing the CCI Lease Sites (“Lease Site SPEs”) are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. We have a variable interest in the Lease Site SPEs but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Lease Site SPEs’ economic performance. These activities include managing tenants and underlying ground leases, performing repair and maintenance on the towers, the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive the expected future residual returns from the purchase option to acquire the CCI Lease Sites. As we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest in the Lease Site SPEs, the Lease Site SPEs are not included on our condensed consolidated financial statements.However, we also considered if this arrangement resulted in the sale of the CCI Lease Sites for which we would derecognize the tower assets. By assessing whether control had transferred, we concluded that transfer of control criteria, as discussed in the revenue standard, were not met. Accordingly, we recorded this arrangement as a financing whereby we recorded debt, a financial obligation, and the CCI Lease Sites tower assets remained on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded long-term financial obligations in the amount of the net proceeds received and recognize interest on the tower obligations. The tower obligations are increased by interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI and through net cash flows generated and retained by CCI from the operation of the tower sites.




Acquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangements

Prior to our merger with Sprint (the “Merger”), Sprint entered into a lease-out and leaseback arrangement with Global Signal Inc., a third party that was subsequently acquired by CCI, that conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,400 tower sites (“Master Lease Sites”) via a master prepaid lease. These agreements were assumed upon the close of the Merger, at which point the remaining term of the lease-out was approximately 17 years with no renewal options. CCI has a fixed price purchase option for all (but not less than all) of the leased or subleased sites for approximately $2.3 billion, exercisable one year prior to the expiration of the agreement and ending 120 days prior to the expiration of the agreement. We lease back a portion of the space at certain tower sites.We considered if this arrangement resulted in the sale of the Master Lease Sites for which we would derecognize the tower assets. By assessing whether control had transferred, we concluded that transfer of control criteria, as discussed in the revenue standard, were not met. Accordingly, we recorded this arrangement as a financing whereby we recorded debt, a financial obligation, and the Master Lease Sites tower assets remained on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.We recognize interest expense on the tower obligations. The tower obligations are increased by the interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI. The tower assets are reported in Property and equipment, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the expected useful life of the towers, which is 20 years.



Leaseback Arrangement

On January 3, 2022, we entered into an agreement (the “Crown Agreement”) with CCI. The Crown Agreement extends the current term of the leasebacks by up to 12 years and modifies the leaseback payments for both the Existing CCI Tower Lease Arrangements and the Acquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangements. As a result of the Crown Agreement, there was an increase in our financing obligation as of the effective date of the Crown Agreement of approximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding decrease to Other long-term liabilities associated with unfavorable contract terms. The modification resulted in a revised
24

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
interest rate under the effective interest method for the tower obligations: 11.6% for the Existing CCI Tower Lease Arrangements and 5.3% for the Acquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangements. There were no changes made to either of our master prepaid leases with CCI.

The following table summarizes the balances associated with both of the tower arrangements on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Future minimum payments related to the tower obligations are approximately $394 million for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025, $783 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending September 30, 2026 and 2027, $829 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending September 30, 2028 and 2029, and $3.8 billion in total thereafter.We are contingently liable for future ground lease payments through the remaining term of the CCI Lease Sites and the Master Lease Sites. These contingent obligations are not included in Operating lease liabilities, as any amount due is contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. Under the arrangement, we remain primarily liable for ground lease payments on approximately 900 sites and have included lease liabilities of $247 million in our Operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024.



Note 10 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation of Revenue

We provide wireless communications services to three primary categories of customers:•Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT);•Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance; and•Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine and Mobile Virtual Network Operator customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.


Postpaid service revenues, including postpaid phone revenues and postpaid other revenues, were as follows:

We operate as a single operating segment. The balances presented in each revenue line item on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income represent categories of revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by type of product and service. Postpaid and prepaid service revenues also include revenues earned for providing premium services to customers, such as device insurance services. Revenue generated from the lease of mobile communication devices is included in Equipment revenues on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

The contract asset and contract liability balances from contracts with customers as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were as follows:
(in millions)Contract AssetsContract LiabilitiesBalance as of December 31, 2023$607 $812 Balance as of September 30, 2024608 1,121 Change$1 $309

Contract assets primarily represent revenue recognized for equipment sales with promotional bill credits offered to customers that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract.The change in the contract asset balance includes customer activity related to new promotions, offset by billings on existing contracts and impairment, which is recognized as bad debt expense. The current portion of our contract assets of $431 million and $495 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, was included in Other current assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.Contract liabilities are recorded when fees are collected, or we have an unconditional right to consideration (a receivable) in advance of delivery of goods or services. Changes in contract liabilities are primarily related to the activity of prepaid customers, including customers acquired through the Ka’ena Acquisition. Contract liabilities are primarily included in Deferred revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include the following:

Remaining Performance Obligations

As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining service performance obligations for postpaid contracts with subsidized devices and promotional bill credits that result in an extended service contract is $1.2 billion. We expect to recognize revenue as the service is provided on these postpaid contracts over an extended contract term of 24 months from the time of origination.Information about remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less has been excluded from the above, which primarily consists of monthly service contracts.Certain of our wholesale, roaming and service contracts include variable consideration based on usage and performance. This variable consideration has been excluded from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the contractual minimum consideration for wholesale, roaming and service contracts is $229 million, $1.4 billion and $3.1 billion for the remainder of 2024, 2025, and 2026 and beyond, respectively. These contracts have a remaining duration ranging from less than one year to seven years.



Contract Costs

The balance of deferred incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred contract costs incurred to obtain postpaid service contracts are amortized over a period of 24 months. The amortization period is monitored to reflect any significant change in assumptions. Amortization of deferred contract costs included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income were $490 million and $468 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.The deferred contract cost asset is assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. There were no impairment losses recognized on deferred contract cost assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

In connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals of the Merger pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement with Sprint and the other parties named therein (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”) and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (collectively, the “Transactions”), we have commitments and other obligations to various state and federal agencies and certain nongovernmental organizations, including pursuant to the Consent Decree agreed to by us, DT, Sprint, SoftBank and DISH and entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the FCC’s memorandum opinion and order approving our applications for approval of the Merger. These commitments and obligations include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, including Americans residing in rural areas, and the marketing of an in-home broadband product where spectrum capacity is available. Other commitments relate to national security, pricing, service, employment and support of diversity initiatives. Many of the commitments specify time frames for compliance and reporting. Failure to fulfill our obligations and commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions.

Contingencies and Litigation

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (“Litigation and Regulatory Matters”) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC or other government agency rules and regulations. Those Litigation and Regulatory Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines,
28

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate. The accruals are reflected on our condensed consolidated financial statements, but they are not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. For Litigation and Regulatory Matters that may result in a contingent gain, we recognize such gains on our condensed consolidated financial statements when the gain is realized or realizable. We recognize legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with Litigation and Regulatory Matters as they are incurred. Except as otherwise specified below, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation and Regulatory Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below, or other matters that we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.On February 28, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint each received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty for allegedly violating section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. On April 29, 2024, the FCC issued Forfeiture Orders against T-Mobile and Sprint that largely adopted the allegations and conclusions of the Notices of Apparent Liability and imposed penalties on T-Mobile and Sprint. T-Mobile and Sprint paid those penalties under protest, and on June 27, 2024, T-Mobile and Sprint filed Petitions for Review challenging the FCC’s Forfeiture Orders in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. We are unable to predict the potential outcome of those proceedings.On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings. These matters include, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint’s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers, even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments.We note that, pursuant to Amendment No. 2, dated as of February 20, 2020, to the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018, by and among the Company, Sprint and the other parties named therein, SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including those relating to the Lifeline matters described above. Resolution of these matters could require us to make additional reimbursements and pay additional fines and penalties, which we do not expect to have a significant impact on our financial results. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank.On June 1, 2021, a putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Dinkevich v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al., Case No. C.A. No. 2021-0479, against DT, SoftBank and certain of our current and former officers and directors, asserting breach of fiduciary duty claims relating to the repricing amendment to the Business Combination Agreement and to SoftBank’s monetization of its T-Mobile shares. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the case. We are unable to predict the potential outcome of these claims.On August 12, 2021, we became aware of a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile’s systems (the “August 2021 cyberattack”). We immediately began an investigation and engaged cybersecurity experts to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data was impacted. Our investigation uncovered that the perpetrator had illegally gained access to certain areas of our systems on or about March 18, 2021, but only gained access to and took data of current, former, and prospective customers beginning on or about August 3, 2021. With the assistance of our outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We also undertook a number of other measures to demonstrate our continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection. We also coordinated with law enforcement. Our forensic investigation is complete, and we believe we have a full view of the data compromised.

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we have become subject to numerous lawsuits, including mass arbitration claims and multiple class action lawsuits that have been filed in numerous jurisdictions seeking, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack. In December 2021, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the federal class action lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri under the caption In re: T-Mobile Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, Case No. 21-md-3019-BCW. On July 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit. On June 29, 2023, the Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement, which is subject to potential appeals. Under the terms of the settlement, we would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs’ counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. We also committed to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. We previously paid $35 million for claims administration purposes. Two class members appealed the final approval order challenging the Court’s award of attorneys’ fees to class counsel. On July 29, 2024, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of one of the appellants and sent the case back to the trial court for further proceedings to resolve plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee request. We expect the remaining portion of the $350 million settlement payment to be made in November 2024. We also anticipate that the settlement will provide a full release of all claims arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack by class members who do not opt out, against all defendants, including us, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our directors and officers. The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants. We have the right to terminate the settlement agreement under certain conditions.We anticipate that this settlement of the class action, along with other settlements of separate consumer claims that have been previously completed or are currently pending, will resolve substantially all of the claims brought to date by our current, former and prospective customers who were impacted by the 2021 cyberattack. In connection with the proposed class action settlement and the separate settlements, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million in the second quarter of 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $50 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack, which is included as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The ultimate resolution of the class action depends on the number of plaintiffs who opt out of the proposed settlement and whether the proposed settlement will be appealed.In addition, in September 2022, a purported Company shareholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery under the caption Harper v. Sievert et al., Case No. 2022-0819-SG, against our current directors and certain of our former directors, alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the Company’s cybersecurity practices. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the lawsuit. On May 31, 2024, the court issued an opinion dismissing the plaintiff’s complaint in its entirety. The plaintiff has appealed that decision. We are unable at this time to predict the potential outcome of this lawsuit or whether we may be subject to further private litigation.We have also received inquiries from various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities related to the August 2021 cyberattack, which could result in substantial fines or penalties. We reached an agreement with the FCC, which was announced on September 30, 2024, to resolve one of those inquiries. We will continue to cooperate fully with the other agencies and regulators inquiring about the matter with an aim to resolve all of these matters. While we hope to resolve them in the near term, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these matters or whether we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions.In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters, and based on the information currently available to us, in addition to the previously recorded pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million noted above, we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Ongoing legal and other costs related to these proceedings and inquiries, as well as any potential future actions, may be substantial, and losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries could be material to our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.On June 17, 2022, plaintiffs filed a putative antitrust class action complaint in the Northern District of Illinois, Dale et al. v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-03189, against DT, T-Mobile, and SoftBank, alleging that the Merger violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition in the U.S. retail cell service market. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and trebled monetary damages on behalf of a purported class of AT&T and Verizon customers whom plaintiffs allege paid artificially inflated prices due to the Merger. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but we are unable to predict the potential outcome.On January 5, 2023, we identified that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single Application Programming Interface (“API”) without authorization. Based on our investigation, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer






30

Index for Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information, such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.In connection with the January 2023 cyberattack, we became subject to consumer class actions and regulatory inquiries, to which we will continue to respond in due course and may incur significant expenses. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters or whether we may be subject to additional legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. In addition, we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers’ behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, although we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on our operations.

Overview

The objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our condensed consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the condensed consolidated financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, and audited consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Merger-Related Costs

Merger-related costs associated with the Sprint Merger generally include:•Integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations, migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing systems and the impact of legal matters assumed as part of the Merger;•Restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and•Transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the transactions.Merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See “Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA” in the “Performance Measures” section of this MD&A. Net cash payments for Merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain for the $100 million extension fee previously paid by DISH associated with the DISH License Purchase Agreement as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The gain was presented as a reduction in Merger-related costs and excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As of June 30, 2024, we have incurred substantially all restructuring and integration costs associated with the Sprint Merger and, accordingly, no longer separately disclose Merger-related costs. The cash payments for the Merger-related costs incurred extend beyond 2024. Cash payments extending beyond 2024 primarily relate to operating and financing leases for which we have recognized accelerated lease expense.

Joint Ventures

On April 24, 2024, we entered into a merger agreement with a fund operated by EQT, Infrastructure VI fund (“Fund VI”), for the joint acquisition by us and Fund VI of Lumos (“Lumos”), a fiber-to-the-home platform, from EQT’s predecessor fund, EQT Infrastructure III. The Lumos joint acquisition is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, we expect to invest approximately $950 million in the joint venture to acquire a 50% equity interest and all existing Lumos fiber customers. The funds invested by us will be used to fund future fiber builds. In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to make an additional capital contribution of approximately $500 million in 2027 or 2028 for the existing business plan. On July 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with KKR & Co. Inc. (“KKR”) to establish a joint venture to acquire Metronet Holdings, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Metronet”), a fiber-to-the-home platform. This arrangement is expected to close in 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, we expect to invest approximately $4.9 billion in the joint venture to acquire a 50% equity interest and all existing residential fiber customers, as well as funding the joint venture. We do not anticipate making further capital contributions following the closing for the existing business plan. The joint ventures will focus on market identification and selection, build plans, network engineering and design, network deployment, and customer installation, with us owning customer relationships and selling fiber service under the T-Mobile brand. Upon closing of the transactions, we expect to account for the Lumos and Metronet joint ventures under the equity method of accounting and recognize service revenues for the acquired Lumos and Metronet fiber customers and wholesale costs paid to the joint ventures for network access within Cost of services on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Acquisition of Ka’ena Corporation

On May 1, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed the merger with Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, among others, Mint Mobile LLC (collectively, “Ka’ena”), and as a result, Ka’ena became a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile (the “Ka’ena Acquisition”). The total purchase price is variable, dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena, and consists of an upfront payment on the Acquisition Date and an earnout payable on August 1, 2026. On the Acquisition Date and in satisfaction of the upfront payment, we transferred $420 million in cash and 3,264,952 shares of T-Mobile common stock valued at $536 million as determined based on its closing market price on April 30, 2024, for a total payment fair value of $956 million. A portion of the upfront payments made on the Acquisition Date was for the settlement of the preexisting wholesale relationship with Ka’ena.Based on the amount paid upfront, up to an additional $403 million in future cash and T-Mobile common stock is payable in satisfaction of the earnout, dependent upon Ka’ena’s achievement of specified performance indicators.Prior to the Ka’ena Acquisition, Ka’ena was a wholesale partner of the Company for which we recognized service revenues within Wholesale and other service revenues. Upon the closing of the Ka’ena Acquisition, this relationship was effectively terminated, and the Company acquired Ka’ena’s prepaid customer relationships and began to recognize service revenues associated with these customers within Prepaid revenues and operating expenses primarily within Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income subsequent to the Acquisition Date.



For more information regarding the Ka’ena Acquisition, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

UScellular Wireless Operations

On May 24, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with United States Cellular Corporation (“UScellular”), Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, we will acquire substantially all of UScellular’s wireless operations and select spectrum assets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.4 billion, payable in cash and the assumption of up to $2.0 billion of debt through an exchange offer to be made to certain UScellular debtholders prior to closing. To the extent any debtholders do not participate in the exchange, their bonds will continue as obligations of UScellular, and the cash portion of the purchase price will be correspondingly increased. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Upon closing of the transaction, we expect to account for the UScellular transaction as a business combination and to consolidate the acquired operations. We expect this transaction will yield approximately $1.0 billion in total annual run rate cost synergies, including operating expense and capital expenditure synergies, upon integration, with total cost to achieve the integration currently estimated at between $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion.

For more information regarding our acquisition of UScellular’s wireless operations, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Performance Measures

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our condensed consolidated financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

Postpaid Accounts

A postpaid account is generally defined as a billing account number that generates revenue. Postpaid accounts generally consist of customers that are qualified for postpaid service utilizing phones, High Speed Internet modems, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT), where they generally pay after receiving service.The following table sets forth the number of ending postpaid accounts:

Customers

A customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Customers are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, High Speed Internet modems, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT), where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance of receiving service.

Churn

Churn represents the number of customers whose service was deactivated as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. The number of customers whose service was deactivated is presented net of customers that subsequently had their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

The following table sets forth the churn:

Postpaid phone churn decreased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.Prepaid churn decreased 3 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to promotional activity.Prepaid churn decreased 4 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the inclusion of prepaid customers associated with the Ka’ena Acquisition with lower churn.



Postpaid Average Revenue Per Account

Postpaid Average Revenue per Account (“ARPA”) represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. Postpaid ARPA is calculated as Postpaid revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid accounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assists in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT).

Postpaid ARPA increased $5.77, or 4%, for the three months ended and increased $4.08, or 3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily from:•Higher premium services, primarily high-end rate plans, net of contra-revenues for content included in such plans, and discounts for specific affinity groups, such as 55+, military and first responders;•An increase in customers per account, including continued adoption of High Speed Internet; and•The impact from rate plan optimizations; partially offset by•Increased promotional activity; and•An increase in High Speed Internet only accounts.


Average Revenue Per User

Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned per customer. ARPU is calculated as service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT).The following table sets forth our operating measure ARPU:

Postpaid Phone ARPU

Postpaid phone ARPU increased $0.86, or 2%, for the three months ended and increased $0.42, or 1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily from:•Higher premium services, primarily high-end rate plans, net of contra-revenues for content included in such plans, and discounts for specific affinity groups, such as 55+, military and first responders; and•The impact from rate plan optimizations; partially offset by•Increased promotional activity; and •Growth in business customers with lower ARPU given larger account sizes.


Prepaid ARPU

Prepaid ARPU decreased $2.37, or 6%, for the three months ended and decreased $1.78, or 5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily from the inclusion of lower ARPU prepaid customers associated with the Ka’ena Acquisition.

Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain expenses, gains and losses, which are not reflective of our ongoing operating performance (“Special Items”). Special Items include Merger-related costs, loss (gain) on disposal groups held for sale, certain legal-related recoveries and expenses, restructuring costs not directly attributable to the Merger (including severance), and other non-core gains and losses. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Core Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We historically used Adjusted EBITDA, and we currently use Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, and Special Items. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the Company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of September 30, 2024, our Cash and cash equivalents were $9.8 billion compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2023.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for Purchases of property and equipment, plus Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Service revenues. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin is utilized by management, investors, and analysts to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert service revenue efficiently into cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business.The table below provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

License Purchase Agreements

On August 8, 2022, we entered into License Purchase Agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC (together with Channel 51 License Co LLC, the “Sellers”) in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. On March 30, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements, pursuant to which we and the Sellers agreed to bifurcate the transaction into two tranches of licenses, with the closings on the acquisitions of certain licenses in Chicago, Dallas and New Orleans being deferred in order to potentially expedite the regulatory approval process for the remainder of the licenses. Subsequently, on August 25, 2023, we and the Sellers entered into Amendments No. 1 to the Amended and Restated License Purchase Agreements, whereby we deferred the closings of certain additional licenses in Chicago and Dallas into the second closing tranche. Together, the licenses with closings deferred into the second closing tranche represent approximately $1.1 billion of the aggregate $3.5 billion cash consideration.The FCC approved the purchase of the first tranche on December 29, 2023. The first tranche closed on June 24, 2024, and the associated payment of $2.4 billion was made on August 5, 2024.Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 22, 2024, the FCC approved the purchase of the Dallas licenses included in the second tranche. We expect the closing on the Dallas licenses and the associated payment of $541 million to occur in December 2024.We anticipate that the closing on the remaining deferred licenses in the second tranche will occur in 2025.The parties have agreed that each of the closings will occur within 180 days after the receipt of the applicable required regulatory approvals, and payment of each portion of the aggregate $3.5 billion purchase price will occur no later than 40 days after the date of each respective closing.On September 12, 2023, we entered into a license purchase agreement with Comcast pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Comcast in exchange for total cash consideration of between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion, subject to an application for FCC approval. The licenses are subject to an exclusive leasing arrangement between us and Comcast entered into contemporaneously with the license purchase agreement. We anticipate the closing will occur in the first half of 2028.On September 10, 2024, we entered into a license purchase agreement with N77 License Co LLC (“Buyer”), pursuant to which Buyer has the option to purchase all or a portion of our remaining 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses in exchange for a range of cash consideration, with the specific licenses sold to be determined based upon the amount of committed financing raised by Buyer. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the licenses subject to the license purchase agreement were held at cost of $2.7 billion in Spectrum licenses on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We maintain the right to terminate the license purchase agreement no later than February 7, 2025, after our receipt of written notice of committed financing as of December 9, 2024, if Buyer’s committed financing is less than a certain target level of cash consideration. If we do not terminate the license purchase agreement, the transaction is subject to FCC approval.

Acquisition of Ka’ena Corporation

On the Acquisition Date, we completed the Ka’ena Acquisition. The total purchase price is variable, dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka’ena, and consists of an upfront payment on the Acquisition Date and an earnout payable on August 1, 2026. On the Acquisition Date and in satisfaction of the upfront payment, we transferred $420 million in cash and 3,264,952 shares of T-Mobile common stock valued at $536 million as determined based on its closing market price on April 30, 2024, for a total payment fair value of $956 million. A portion of the upfront payment made on the Acquisition Date was for the settlement of the preexisting wholesale relationship with Ka’ena.Based on the amount paid upfront, up to an additional $403 million in future cash and T-Mobile common stock is payable in satisfaction of the earnout, dependent upon Ka’ena’s achievement of specified performance indicators.


For more information regarding the Ka’ena Acquisition, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Lumos Joint Venture

On April 24, 2024, we entered into a merger agreement with Fund VI for the joint acquisition by us and Fund VI of Lumos from EQT’s predecessor fund, EQT Infrastructure III. The Lumos joint acquisition is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, we expect to invest approximately $950 million in the joint venture to acquire a 50% equity interest and all existing Lumos fiber customers. The funds invested by us will be used to fund future fiber builds. In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, we expect to make an additional capital contribution of approximately $500 million in 2027 or 2028 for the existing business plan.

For more information regarding the Lumos joint venture, see Note 3 – Joint Ventures of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

UScellular Wireless Operations

On May 24, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with UScellular pursuant to which, among other things, we will acquire substantially all of UScellular’s wireless operations and select spectrum assets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.4 billion, payable in cash and the assumption of up to $2.0 billion of debt through an exchange offer to be made to certain UScellular debtholders prior to closing. To the extent any debtholders do not participate in the exchange, their bonds will continue as obligations of UScellular, and the cash portion of the purchase price will be correspondingly increased. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals.Following the closing of the transaction, UScellular will retain ownership of its other spectrum, as well as its towers. Subject to the closing of the transaction, we will enter into a 15-year master license agreement to lease space on at least 2,100 towers being retained and to extend our tenancy term on approximately 600 towers where we are already leasing space from UScellular for 15 years post-closing. We estimate the incremental future minimum lease payments associated with the master license agreement will be $1.4 billion over 15 years post-closing.


Metronet Joint Venture

On July 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with KKR to establish a joint venture to acquire Metronet. This arrangement is expected to close in 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, we expect to invest approximately $4.9 billion in the joint venture to acquire a 50% equity interest and all existing residential fiber customers, as well as funding the joint venture. We do not anticipate making further capital contributions following the closing for the existing business plan.

For more information regarding the Metronet joint venture, see Note 3 – Joint Ventures of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we derecognized net receivables of $2.3 billion upon sale through these arrangements.

For more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 5 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity

We may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional debt, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other long-lived assets in private party transactions, repurchase shares, pay dividends or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for acquisitions of businesses, spectrum and other long-lived assets, or for any potential stockholder returns, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months, as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of debt, tower obligations, share repurchases, and dividend payments.We determine future liquidity requirements for operations, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividend payments based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum or repurchase shares. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses to comply with the Government Commitments, and we have incurred all of the remaining restructuring and integration costs associated with the Merger, with the cash expenditures for the Merger-related costs extending beyond 2024. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.



Financing Lease Facilities

We have uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain third parties that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into $9.7 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $402 million and $969 million was executed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We expect to enter into up to a total of $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2024.

Capital Expenditures

Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel and customer base of T-Mobile and Sprint. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our network and spectrum licenses, including acquired Sprint PCS and 2.5 GHz spectrum licenses, as we build out our nationwide 5G network. We expect a reduction in capital expenditures related to these efforts in 2024 compared to 2023 given the substantial deployment of the 5G network completed in the preceding years. Future capital expenditure requirements will include the deployment of our acquired C-band licenses.

For more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stockholder Returns

Critical Accounting Estimates

Preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.


Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

For information regarding recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.


Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio.As of September 30, 2024, we held €2.0 billion in EUR-denominated Senior Notes, which are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have entered into cross-currency swap agreements that qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges of our EUR-denominated debt, mitigating our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.

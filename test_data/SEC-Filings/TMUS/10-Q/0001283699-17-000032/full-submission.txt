Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)


Note 1 – Basis of Presentation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.The condensed consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (“VIE”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations (Tower obligations are included in VIEs related to the 2012 Tower Transaction. See Note 8 - Tower Obligations included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.



Change in Accounting Principle

Effective January 1, 2017, the imputed discount on Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”) receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method, and was previously presented within Interest income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is now presented within Other revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from our major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. We have applied this change retrospectively and presented the effect on the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, in the tables below:

The change in accounting principle did not have an impact on basic or diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, or Accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”), and has since modified the standard with several ASU’s. The standard is effective for us, and we will adopt the standard, on January 1, 2018.The standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.The guidance permits two methods of adoption, the full retrospective method applying the standard to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. The standard also allows entities to apply certain practical expedients at their discretion. We are adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative catch up adjustment and will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous rules.We continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard but anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impacts may include the following items:•Whether our EIP contracts contain a significant financing component, which is similar to our current practice of imputing interest, and would similarly impact the amount of revenue recognized at the time of an EIP sale and whether or not a portion of the revenue is recognized as interest and included in other revenues, rather than equipment revenues.•As we currently expense contract acquisition costs, we believe that the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contracts to which the costs relate will have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. We plan to utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less. •Whether bill credits earned over time result in extended service contracts, which would impact the allocation and timing of revenue recognition between service revenue and equipment revenue.•Overall, with the exception of the aforementioned impacts, we do not expect that the new standard will result in a substantive change to the method of allocation of contract revenues between various services and equipment, nor to the timing of when revenues are recognized for most of our service contracts.We are still in the process of evaluating these impacts, and our initial assessment may change due to changes in the terms and mix of the contractual arrangements we have with customers. New products or offerings, or changes to current offerings may yield significantly different impacts than currently expected.We are in the process of implementing significant new revenue accounting systems, processes and internal controls over revenue recognition which will ultimately assist us in the application of the new standard.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The standard requires all lessees to report a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most leases. The income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification. The standard requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” classification tests. For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. We are currently evaluating the standard, which will require recognizing and measuring leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 and expect the adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right to use assets and liabilities that have not previously been recorded, which will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, and will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). Early adoption is permitted for us as of January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” The standard is intended to reduce current diversity in practice and provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, and will require a retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption. The standard will impact the presentation of cash flows related to beneficial interests in securitization, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $800 million and $900 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $1.8 billion for both the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The standard will also impact the presentation of cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $159 million and $188 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The standard requires that the income tax impact of intra-entity sales and transfers of property, except for inventory, be recognized when the transfer occurs. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, and will require any deferred taxes not yet recognized on intra-entity transfers to be recorded to retained earnings under a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” The standard requires entities to include in their cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. The ASU does not define the terms “restricted cash” and “restricted cash equivalents.” The standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, and will require a retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” The standard eliminates the requirement to measure the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all assets and liabilities within that unit (“the Step 2 test”) from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit. The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, and must be applied to any annual or interim goodwill impairment assessments after that date. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard and timing of adoption, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 – Equipment Installment Plan Receivables

We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and accessories in installments over a period of up to 24 months using an EIP.The following table summarizes the EIP receivables:

(in millions)June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016EIP receivables, gross$3,496 $3,230Unamortized imputed discount(231) (195)EIP receivables, net of unamortized imputed discount3,265 3,035Allowance for credit losses(103) (121)EIP receivables, net$3,162 $2,914   Classified on the balance sheet as:   Equipment installment plan receivables, net$2,060 $1,930Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net1,102 984EIP receivables, net$3,162 $2,914

We use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer at the time of application for mobile communications service using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores and service plan characteristics. Based upon customer credit profiles, we classify EIP receivables into the credit categories of “Prime” and “Subprime.” Prime customer receivables are those with lower delinquency risk and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher delinquency risk. Subprime customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases. In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category are required to pay an advance deposit.EIP receivables for which invoices have not yet been generated for the customer are classified as Unbilled. EIP receivables for which invoices have been generated but which are not past the contractual due date are classified as Billed – Current. EIP receivables for which invoices have been generated and the payment is past the contractual due date are classified as Billed – Past Due.The balance and aging of the EIP receivables on a gross basis by credit category were as follows:


June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(in millions)Prime Subprime Total Prime Subprime TotalUnbilled$1,416 $1,871 $3,287 $1,343 $1,686 $3,029Billed – Current57 83 140 51 77 128Billed – Past Due24 45 69 25 48 73EIP receivables, gross$1,497 $1,999 $3,496 $1,419 $1,811 $3,230

Activity for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, in the unamortized imputed discount and allowance for credit losses balances for the EIP receivables was as follows:

We have entered into transactions to sell certain service and EIP accounts receivables. The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our financial statements, are described below.

Sales of Service Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivables on a revolving basis and in November 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million (the “service receivable sale arrangement”) with a scheduled expiration date in March 2018. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the service receivable sale arrangement provided funding of $879 million and $907 million, respectively. Sales of receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. The receivables consist of service charges currently due from customers and are short-term in nature.In connection with the service receivable sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity to sell service accounts receivables (the “Service BRE”). The Service BRE does not qualify as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), and due to the significant level of control we exercise over the entity, it is consolidated. Pursuant to the arrangement, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries transfer selected receivables to the Service BRE. The Service BRE then sells the receivables to an unaffiliated entity (the “Service VIE”), which was established to facilitate the sale of beneficial ownership interests in the receivables to certain third parties.


Variable Interest Entity

We determined that the Service VIE qualifies as a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities. We have a variable interest in the Service VIE, but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Service VIE’s economic performance. Those activities include committing the Service VIE to legal agreements to purchase or sell assets, selecting which receivables are purchased in the service receivable sale arrangement, determining whether the Service VIE will sell interests in the purchased service receivables to other parties, funding of the entities and servicing of receivables. We do not hold the power to direct the key decisions underlying these activities. For example, while we act as the servicer of the sold receivables, which is considered a significant activity of the Service VIE, we are acting as an agent in our capacity as the servicer and the counterparty to the service receivable sale arrangement has the ability to remove us as the servicing agent of the receivables at will with no recourse available to us. As we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, the results of the Service VIE are not consolidated into our condensed consolidated financial statements.The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consists primarily of the deferred purchase price and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to our variable interest in the Service VIE:

Sales of EIP Receivables

Overview of the Transaction

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivables on a revolving basis and in June 2016, the EIP sale arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion (the “EIP sale arrangement”) with a scheduled expiration date in November 2017. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the EIP sale arrangement provided funding of $1.2 billion each period. Sales of EIP receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. The receivables consist of customer EIP balances, which require monthly customer payments for up to 24 months.In connection with this EIP sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the “EIP BRE”). Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, our wholly-owned subsidiary transfers selected receivables to the EIP BRE. The EIP BRE then sells the receivables to a non-consolidated and unaffiliated third-party entity for which we do not exercise any level of control, nor does the entity qualify as a VIE.

Variable Interest Entity

We determined that the EIP BRE is a VIE as its equity investment at risk lacks the obligation to absorb a certain portion of its expected losses. We have a variable interest in the EIP BRE and determined that we are the primary beneficiary based on our ability to direct the activities which most significantly impact the EIP BRE’s economic performance. Those activities include selecting which receivables are transferred into the EIP BRE and sold in the EIP sale arrangement and funding of the EIP BRE. Additionally, our equity interest in the EIP BRE obligates us to absorb losses and gives us the right to receive benefits from the EIP BRE that could potentially be significant to the EIP BRE. Accordingly, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary, and include the balances and results of operations of the EIP BRE in our condensed consolidated financial statements.The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consists primarily of the deferred purchase price and liabilities included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to the EIP BRE:

(in millions)June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Other current assets$349 $371Other assets106 83Other long-term liabilities3 4

In addition, the EIP BRE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to any liquidation of the EIP BRE, to be satisfied prior to any value in the EIP BRE becoming available to us. Accordingly, the assets of the EIP BRE may not be used to settle our general obligations and creditors of the EIP BRE have limited recourse to our general credit.

Sales of Receivables

The transfers of service receivables and EIP receivables to the non-consolidated entities are accounted for as sales of financial assets. Once identified for sale, the receivable is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Upon sale, we derecognize the net carrying amount of the receivables. We recognize the net cash proceeds in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The proceeds are net of the deferred purchase price, consisting of a receivable from the purchasers that entitles us to certain collections on the receivables. We recognize the collection of the deferred purchase price in Net cash provided by operating activities as it is dependent on collection of the customer receivables and is not subject to significant interest rate risk. The deferred purchase price represents a financial asset that is primarily tied to the creditworthiness of the customers and which can be settled in such a way that we may not recover substantially all of our recorded investment, due to default by the customers on the underlying receivables. We elected, at inception, to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), including customer default rates. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our deferred purchase price related to the sales of service receivables and EIP receivables was $676 million and $659 million, respectively.The following table summarizes the impacts of the sale of certain service receivables and EIP receivables in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

We recognized losses from sales of receivables of $80 million and $46 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $175 million and $98 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These losses from sales of receivables were recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Losses from sales of receivables include adjustments to the receivables’ fair values and changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price.

Continuing Involvement

Pursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables and are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where write-off is imminent. We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales. While servicing the receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures to the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers. Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, under certain circumstances, we are required to deposit cash or replacement EIP receivables primarily for contracts terminated by customers under our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!”) Program.In addition, we have continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the sale arrangements. Our maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables sold under the sale arrangements was $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2017. The maximum exposure to loss, which is a required disclosure under GAAP, represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances whereby we would not receive the deferred purchase price portion of the contractual proceeds withheld by the purchasers and would also be required to repurchase the maximum amount of receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements without consideration for any recovery. As we believe the probability of these circumstances occurring is remote, the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of our expected loss.

Spectrum License Exchange

In March 2017, we closed on an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain spectrum licenses. Upon closing of the transaction, we recorded the spectrum licenses received at their estimated fair value of approximately $123 million and recognized a gain of $37 million included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.In April 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Our spectrum licenses to be transferred as part of the exchange transaction were reclassified as assets held for sale and were included in Other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their carrying value of $86 million as of June 30, 2017.


Broadcast Incentive Auction

In April 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. At the inception of the auction in June 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the FCC which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in April 2017. In May 2017, we paid the FCC the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing purchase commitments. See Note 6 - Debt for further information. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses as of June 30, 2017, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to begin deployment of these licenses on our network in the second half of 2017.


Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates, accounts payable, and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility with DT approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The carrying amounts and fair values of our short-term investments and long-term debt included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

Long-term Debt

The fair value of our Senior Notes to third parties was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore was classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loans, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates, Senior Notes to affiliates and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates was determined based on a discounted cash flow approach using quoted prices of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for our standalone credit risk. Accordingly, our Senior Secured Term Loans, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates, Senior Notes to affiliates and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.Although we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Secured Term Loans, Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates, Senior Notes to affiliates and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates. The fair value estimates were based on information available as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange. As of June 30, 2017, the carrying value of the Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates approximates fair value, due to our ability to call the facility without penalty.

Deferred Purchase Price Assets

In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.

Guarantee Liabilities

We offer a device trade-in program, JUMP!, which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. For customers who enroll in the device trade-in program, we defer the portion of equipment revenues which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee incorporating the expected probability and timing of the handset upgrade and the estimated fair value of the used handset which is returned. Accordingly, our guarantee liabilities were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Guarantee liabilities are included in Other current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.The total estimated remaining gross EIP receivable balances of all enrolled handset upgrade program customers, which are the remaining EIP amounts underlying the JUMP! guarantee, including EIP receivables that have been sold, was $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2017. This is not an indication of our expected loss exposure as it does not consider the expected fair value of the used handset or the probability and timing of the trade-in.

(“T-Mobile USA”), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (“Incremental Term Loan Facility”) with DT, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increased DT’s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided T-Mobile USA with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment.On January 31, 2017, the loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on November 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on January 31, 2024. No issuance fees were incurred related to this debt agreement for the six months ended June 30, 2017.On March 31, 2017, the Incremental Term Loan Facility was further amended to waive all interim principal payments. The outstanding principal balance will be due at maturity.During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we issued the following Senior Notes:

These early redemption fees were recorded as discounts on the issuance of the new DT Notes. The proceeds from the net settlement were $421 million and are included in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The closing of the issuance and sale of the remaining $500 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 to DT is expected to occur on or about September 18, 2017.During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we also issued the following Senior Notes:

On May 9, 2017, we exercised our option under existing purchase agreements and issued Senior Notes to DT. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of spectrum licenses won in the 600 MHz spectrum auction. Net proceeds from these issuances include $64 million in debt premiums. See Note 4 - Spectrum License Transactions for further information.

Revolving Credit Facility

We had $680 million and $0 million outstanding borrowings under our $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility with DT as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in Proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and Repayments of revolving credit facility within Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.


Note 7 – Income Taxes

Within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, we recorded an Income tax expense of $353 million and $147 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $262 million and $419 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in each period was primarily from higher income before income taxes offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 37.8% and 39.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 17.0% and 37.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in the effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions that resulted in the recognition of $270 million in tax benefits in the first quarter of 2017 and the recognition of an additional $11 million in tax benefits in the second quarter of 2017. Total tax benefits were $281 million through June 30, 2017. The effective tax rate was further decreased by the recognition of $60 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $21 million for the same period in 2016.During the first quarter of 2017, due to ongoing analysis of positive and negative evidence related to the utilization of the deferred tax assets, we determined that a portion of the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. Positive evidence supporting the release of a portion of the valuation allowance included reaching a position of cumulative income over a three-year period in the state jurisdictions as well as projecting sustained earnings in those jurisdictions. Due to this positive evidence, we reduced the valuation allowance which resulted in a decrease to Deferred tax liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We will continue to monitor positive and negative evidence related to the utilization of the remaining deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance continues to be provided. It is possible that we may release additional portions of the remaining valuation allowance within the next 6 months.

Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement

T-Mobile USA has entered into a renewable energy purchase agreement with Red Dirt Wind Project, LLC. The agreement is based on the expected operation of a wind energy-generating facility located in Oklahoma and will remain in effect until the twelfth anniversary of the facility’s entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur by the end of 2017. The renewable energy purchase agreement consists of two components: (1) an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility and (2) a commitment to purchase the renewable energy credits (“RECs”) associated with the energy output generated by the facility. T-Mobile USA will net settle the forward agreement and acquire the RECs monthly by paying, or receiving, an aggregate net payment based on two variables (1) the facility’s energy output, which has an estimated maximum capacity of approximately 160 megawatts and (2) the difference between (a) an initial fixed price, subject to annual escalation, and (b) current local marginal energy prices during the monthly settlement period. We have determined that the renewable energy purchase agreement does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The renewable energy purchase agreement does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the renewable energy purchase agreement did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility nor do we receive specific energy output from it. No amounts were settled under the agreement during the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Related-Party Commitments

During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we entered into certain debt related transactions with affiliates. See Note 6 - Debt for further information.

Contingencies and Litigation

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (“Litigation Matters”) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include numerous court actions alleging that we are infringing various patents. Virtually all of the patent infringement cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages, although they occasionally seek injunctive relief as well. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could include an award of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months, if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements but that we do not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to: uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; uncertain damage theories and demands; and a less than fully developed factual record. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.

Note 10 – Guarantor Financial Information

Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, issued by T-Mobile USA (“Issuer”) is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (“Parent”) and certain of the Issuer’s 100% owned subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”).In January 2017, T-Mobile USA, and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, borrowed $4.0 billion under the Incremental Term Loan Facility to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt.In March 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of public 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022, (ii) issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of public 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and (iii) issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of public 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027.In April 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022, (ii) issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and (iii) issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027. Additionally, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, redeemed through net settlement, all of the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.288% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2019 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 6.366% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2020.In May 2017, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021, (ii) issued $1.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024.See Note 6 - Debt for further information.The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. The indentures and credit facilities governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of the indentures and the supplemental indentures.Presented below is the condensed consolidating financial information as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

Overview

The objectives of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are to provide users of our condensed consolidated financial statements with the following:•A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;•Context to the financial statements; and•Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.Our MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.



Business Overview

Effective January 1, 2017, the imputed discount on EIP receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and was previously recognized within Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is recognized within Other revenues in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from the Company’s major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. We have applied this change retrospectively and the effect of this change for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, was a reclassification of $65 million and $130 million, respectively, from Interest income to Other revenues. The amortization of imputed discount on our EIP receivables for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, was $68 million and $130 million, respectively. For additional information, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2017, we introduced, Un-carrier Next, where monthly wireless service fees and sales taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for T-Mobile ONE. We also unveiled Kickback on T-Mobile ONE, where participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit on their next month’s bill per qualifying line. In addition, we introduced the Un-contract for T-Mobile ONE with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan which allows current T-Mobile ONE customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.



Results of Operations


Highlights for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016

•Total revenues of $10.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $926 million, or 10%. Total revenues of $19.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $1.9 billion, or 10%. These increases were primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. On September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) partner for nominal consideration (the “MVNO Transaction”). The MVNO Transaction shifted Branded postpaid revenues to Wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.•Service revenues of $7.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $557 million, or 8%. Service revenues of $14.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $1.3 billion, or 10%. These increases were primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and the success of our MetroPCS brand.•Equipment revenues of $2.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $318 million, or 15%. Equipment revenues of $4.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $510 million, or 13%. These increases were primarily due to higher average revenue per device sold and an increase from the purchase of leased devices at the end of the lease term.•Operating income of $1.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $583 million, or 70%, primarily due to increases in total service revenues, lower depreciation and amortization and better cost management, particularly in cost of equipment sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income of $2.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $452 million, or 23%, primarily due to increases in total service revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and higher Selling, general and administrative expenses.•Net income of $581 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $356 million, or 158%. Net income of $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $575 million, or 82%. These increases were primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above. Additionally, net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased due to a tax benefit related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016, included $389 million of net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses compared to $23 million of net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017. •Adjusted EBITDA (see “Performance Measures”), a non-GAAP financial measure, of $3.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $483 million, or 19%. Adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $337 million, or 6%. These increases were primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was impacted by lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. Adjusted EBITDA included pre-tax spectrum gains of $38 million and $636 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $61 million, or 3%. Net cash provided by operating activities of $3.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $749 million, or 27% (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). •Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $482 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased $63 million, or 15%. Free Cash Flow of $667 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $558 million, or 512% (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Set forth below is a summary of our consolidated results:

Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale;•An increase of $182 million from the purchase of previously leased devices at the end of the lease term; and•An increase of $45 million in SIM and Upgrade revenue; partially offset by •A decrease of $133 million in lease revenues from declining JUMP! On Demand population due to shifting focus to our EIP financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016.•An increase of $335 million in device sales revenues, primarily from:•Higher average revenue per device sold due to an increase in the high-end device mix by an iconic device launch; and•A 2% increase in the number of devices sold. Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale;•An increase of $229 million from the purchase of previously leased devices at the end of the lease term;•An increase of $95 million in SIM and Upgrade revenue; partially offset by•A decrease of $151 million from declining JUMP! On Demand population due to shifting focus to our EIP financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016.Under our JUMP! On Demand program, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. The residual value of purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues when revenue recognition criteria have been met.Gross EIP device financing to our customers increased by $95 million for the three months ended and $188 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the number of devices financed as a result of our continued focus on EIP sales.Operating expenses increased $343 million, or 4%, for the three months ended and $1.4 billion, or 9%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from:Cost of services increased $89 million, or 6%, for the three months ended and $76 million, or 3%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.•Higher lease expenses associated with network expansion; and•Higher international roaming primarily driven by Mobile without Borders; partially offset by•Lower long distance and toll costs as we continue to renegotiate contracts with vendors.•Higher lease expenses associated with network expansion; and•Higher international roaming primarily driven by Mobile without Borders; partially offset by•Lower long distance and toll costs as we continue to renegotiate contracts with vendors; and•Lower regulatory expenses related to T-Mobile ONE rate plans, inclusive of Un-carrier Next.Cost of equipment sales increased $227 million, or 9%, for the three months ended and $539 million, or 11%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.•An increase of $146 million from the recognition of cost for leased devices purchased at the end of the lease term; and•An increase of $122 million in device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to:•Higher average cost per device sold due to an increase in the high-end device mix; slightly offset by•A 4% decrease in the number of devices sold; partially offset by•A decrease of $28 million in other costs related to inventory and warranty exchange activities.•An increase of $417 million in device cost of equipment sales, primarily from:•A higher average cost per device sold due to an increase in the high-end device mix; partially offset by•A 2% decrease in the number of devices sold; and•An increase from the recognition of cost for leased devices purchased at the end of the lease term; partially offset by•A decrease of $26 million in accessory cost driven by 7% volume decrease; and•A decrease of $39 million in other costs related to inventory and warranty exchange activities.Under our JUMP!

On July 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. We do not expect to incur significant additional network decommissioning costs in 2017.Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses were flat for the three months ended and decreased $598 million, or 94%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the first quarter of 2016.Net Income increased $356 million, or 158%, for the three months ended and $575 million, or 82%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from:•Operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $583 million, or 70%, for the three months ended and $452 million, or 23%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.•Income tax expense increased $206 million, or 140%, for the three months ended and decreased $157 million, or 37%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.•Higher income before income taxes; partially offset by•A lower effective tax rate.

The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions that resulted in the recognition of $270 million in tax benefits in the first quarter of 2017 and the recognition of an additional $11 million in tax benefits in the second quarter of 2017. Total tax benefits were $281 million through June 30, 2017. The effective tax rate was further decreased by the recognition of $60 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $21 million for the same period in 2016; partially offset by •Higher income before income taxes.

Performance Measures

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

Total Customers

A customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones or mobile broadband devices (including tablets), where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include Machine to Machine (“M2M”) and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.The following table sets forth the number of ending customers:

We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4.4 million reported wholesale customers as of the beginning of Q2 2017.The MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on September 1, 2016. Prospectively from September 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within Wholesale customers.


Branded Customers

Total branded customers increased 3,911,000, or 7%, primarily from:•Higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, including the launch of DIGITS, and the growing success of our business channel, @Work, partially offset by the MVNO Transaction;•Higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our Metro PCS brand, continued growth from distribution expansion; and•Higher branded postpaid mobile broadband customers primarily due to the launch of SyncUP DRIVETM.


Wholesale

Wholesale customers decreased 1,733,000, or 12%, primarily due to Lifeline subscribers which were excluded from our reported wholesale subscriber base as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. This decrease was partially offset by the MVNO Transaction and the continued success of the Company’s MVNO and M2M partnerships.

Branded Customers

Total branded net customer additions decreased 455,000, or 33%, for the three months ended and 1,003,000, or 31%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from:•Lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to lower gross additions from increased competitive activity in the marketplace and higher deactivations from a growing customer base, partially offset by the continued strong performance of our MetroPCS brand; and•Lower branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to our election to not pursue promotional tablet offers, higher deactivations resulting from churn on a growing customer base, partially offset by higher gross customer additions from the launch of SyncUP DRIVETM; partially offset by•Higher branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to a strong response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, including the launch of DIGITS and the growing success of our business channel, @Work, and lower churn, partially offset by an increased competitive environment.


Wholesale

Wholesale net customer additions decreased 93,000, or 18%, for the three months ended and 624,000, or 70%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from lower customer gross additions, partially offset by lower customer deactivations.

Customers Per Account

Customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis. June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 Change  # %Branded postpaid customers per account2.91 2.64 0.27 10%Branded postpaid customers per account increased 0.27 points, or 10%, primarily from growth of customers on promotions targeting families and the MVNO Transaction as the customers transferred had a lower number of branded postpaid customers per account.


Churn

Churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

Average Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per User

ARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues. Average Billings Per User (“ABPU”) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings before securitization, per customer. We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.The following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain expenses not reflective of T-Mobile’s operating performance. Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of June 30, 2017, our Cash and cash equivalents were $181 million.

Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of T-Mobile’s financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

(“T-Mobile USA”), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (“Incremental Term Loan Facility”) with DT, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increased DT’s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided T-Mobile USA with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment.On January 31, 2017, the loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on November 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on January 31, 2024.

On March 31, 2017, the Incremental Term Loan Facility was further amended to waive all interim principal payments. The outstanding principal balance will be due at maturity.During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we issued the following Senior Notes:

These early redemption fees were recorded as discounts on the issuance of the new DT Notes. The proceeds from the net settlement were $421 million and are included in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The closing of the issuance and sale of the remaining $500 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 to DT is expected to occur on or about September 18, 2017.During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we also issued the following Senior Notes:

On May 9, 2017, we exercised our option under existing purchase agreements and issued Senior Notes to DT. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of spectrum licenses won in the 600 MHz spectrum auction. Net proceeds from these issuances include $64 million in debt premiums. See Note 4 - Spectrum License Transactions for further information.

Revolving Credit Facility

We had $680 million and $0 million outstanding borrowings under our $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility with DT as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Proceeds and repayments from the revolving credit facility are presented in Proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and Repayments of revolving credit facility within Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 6 – Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2017, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions or other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions and redemption of high yield callable debt.We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of June 30, 2017.

Capital Lease Facilities

We have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. As of June 30, 2017, we have committed to $1.9 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $314 million and $597 million was executed during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. We expect to enter into up to an additional $303 million in capital lease commitments during 2017.

Capital Expenditures

Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017, excluding capitalized interest. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.In April 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 MHz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. At the inception of the auction in June 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the FCC which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in April 2017. In May 2017, we paid the FCC the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing debt purchase commitments. See Note 6 - Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.The $5.8 billion payment of the purchase price is included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits within Net cash used in investing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The licenses are included in Spectrum licenses as of June 30, 2017 on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to begin deployment of these licenses on our network in the second half of 2017. See Note 4 - Spectrum License Transactions of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.




Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis through November 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In June 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion with a scheduled expiration date in November 2017. In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through March 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In November 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million with a scheduled expiration date in March 2018. As of June 30, 2017, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.4 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 3 – Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

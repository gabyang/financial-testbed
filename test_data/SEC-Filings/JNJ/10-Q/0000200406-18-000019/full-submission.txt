CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and other benefits; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition on the basis of cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales and reputational damage;
•Impact of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or the Corporate Integrity Agreements of the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Affiliates, or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;





•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;
•Changes in tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Health Care Market Trends
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company, including the integration of Actelion Ltd., may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and future restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required consultation procedures relating to restructuring of workforce.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally or within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems, and those of the Company's vendors, could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required consultation procedures relating to restructuring of workforce and any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the recently announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products.





Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 — The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.

New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with CustomersOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (new revenue standard) to all contracts using the modified retrospective method.  The cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.  The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  The adoption of the new revenue standard has not had a material impact to either reported Sales to customers or Net earnings.  Additionally, the Company will continue to recognize revenue from product sales as goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, as control of goods occurs at the same time.  In accordance with the new standard requirements, the disclosure of the impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Balance Sheet was as follows:

Statement of Earnings - For the fiscal three months ended April 1, 2018 (Dollars in millions)As Reported Effect of change Balance without adoption of ASC 606Sales to customers$20,009 (29) 19,980      Net earnings4,367 (25) 4,342      Balance Sheet - As of April 1, 2018 As Reported Effect of change Balance without adoption of ASC 606Assets156,625 19 156,644Liabilities93,370 (3) 93,367      Equity$63,255 22 63,277

The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, which decreased beginning retained earnings by $47 million. As part of the adoption of ASC 606 see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2017, 2016 and 2015.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products, which is included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net earnings. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 that increased retained earnings by $232 million net of tax and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously unrealized gains from equity investments.  For additional details see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than InventoryThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. The Company recorded net adjustments to deferred taxes of approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease to Other Assets of approximately $0.7 billion and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Company's 2018 financial results.ASU 2017-01: Clarifying the Definition of a BusinessThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This update was applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.ASU 2017-07: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit CostThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost (“NPBC”). In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization. The amendments in this update are required to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and prospectively, on and after the adoption date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of NPBC in assets. As required by the transition provisions of this update, the Company made the following reclassifications to the 2017 fiscal first quarter Consolidated Statement of Earnings to retroactively apply classification of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC:

ASU 2018-02: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThis update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging ActivitiesThis update makes more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is planning to early adopt this standard in the fiscal second quarter of 2018 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements.ASU 2016-02: LeasesThis update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company anticipates that most of its operating leases will result in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, however it does not expect the standard to have a material impact on the financial position. The actual impact will depend on the Company's lease portfolio at the time of adoption. The Company continues to assess all implications of the standard and related financial disclosures.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.




NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings.The Company also uses equity collar contracts to manage exposure to market risk associated with certain equity investments.     All three types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.  The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.  Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements.  As of April 1, 2018, the total amount of collateral paid under the credit support agreements amounted to $32 million, net. For equity collar contracts, the Company pledged the underlying hedged marketable equity securities to the counter-party as collateral.  On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of April 1, 2018, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps  of $35.3 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of  $34.5 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account.  On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts.  For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense.  For the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material.During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. The change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a $150 million unrealized pretax loss for the fiscal first quarter of April 1, 2018 reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  The change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a cumulative $372 million unrealized pretax loss from hedge inception through the fiscal first quarter of 2018, reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

As of April 1, 2018, the balance of deferred net gains on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $84 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

This ASU amends prior guidance to classify equity investments with readily determinable market values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net earnings. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 which increased retained earnings by $232 million, net of tax, and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously net unrealized gains from equity investments.  The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values.  The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments for the fiscal first quarter of 2018:

Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e. forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value.The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:

NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal three months of 2018 and 2017 were 20.3% and 20.7%, respectively. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted into law effective January 1, 2018.  This law reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminates or reduces certain corporate income tax deductions and introduces a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).  In December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of $13.0 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA.  Under the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), the provisional amount was a reasonable estimate based on the most recent information and guidance available related to the calculation of the tax liability and the impact to its deferred tax assets and liabilities, including those recorded for foreign local and withholding taxes as of the 2017 assessment date of January 18, 2018. As noted below, the Company made adjustments in the first quarter of 2018. All amounts recorded remain provisional and may require further adjustments and changes to the Company’s estimates as new guidance is made available. The estimate is subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the TCJA, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns. Revisions to the provisional charge may be material to the Company's future financial results. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for further details on the TCJA and SAB 118. The Company completed its acquisition of AMO in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, and incurred incremental tax costs that were discretely recorded in the first quarter of 2017, which increased the effective tax rate by 3.8% for the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2018.  Additionally, in 2018 the Company had more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017. Remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets recorded for the foreign withholding taxes and related U.S. foreign tax credits, respectively, increased the Company’s effective tax rate in 2018 by approximately 1.4% due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. Tax benefits received from stock-based compensation during the fiscal three months of 2018 and 2017, reduced the effective tax rate by 2.2% and 3.6%, respectively. The reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate, offset by the elimination of the corporate income tax deductions, measurement period adjustments(1) and the GILTI tax(2), decreased the Company’s worldwide effective rate as compared to the same period of the prior year. As previously disclosed, the Company has elected to provisionally treat the GILTI tax as a period expense, pending further analysis by management of this new tax provision.  (1)The following adjustments were made to the provisional tax amounts in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 due to issued Treasury guidance and revisions to the Company’s estimates since the assessment date:•$0.2 billion increase to the transition tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 due to U.S. Treasury Department’s issuance of Notice 2018-13 on January 19, 2018•$0.3 billion decrease to the deferred tax liability for foreign local taxes, partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 billion in deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credits due to updated estimates from the amounts recorded in 2017.These measurement period adjustments decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 0.5% in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year.  (2) The impact of GILTI on the first quarter effective tax rate was an increase of 2.6%.As of April 1, 2018, the Company had approximately $3.2 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. The Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 10— BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

During the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company announced a binding offer from Platinum Equity, a private investment firm, to acquire its LifeScan business for approximately $2.1 billion, subject to customary adjustments. As of April 1, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.1 billion of inventory, $0.2 billion of property, plant and equipment, $0.1 billion of intangible assets, net and $1.0 billion of goodwill.  The Company will retain certain net liabilities associated with the LifeScan business. Additionally, during the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company announced the acquisition of Orthotaxy, a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution. On June 16, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). The Company currently holds 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion. The convertible loan may be converted into Idorsia shares as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a ten year term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. The investment in Idorsia was recorded as a cost method investment in Other assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 2 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia with a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million. As of April 1, 2018, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility.  Actelion has entered into a transitional services agreement with Idorsia.  Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelion’s specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need. The Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The allocation of the purchase price included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change.  To assist management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals.  The Company will finalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The Company expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.  The following table presents the preliminary amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date as well as the adjustments made up to April 1, 2018:

The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. As of April 1, 2018, patents and trademarks, net of a liability assumed, of $0.4 billion were classified as assets held for sale as they related to the pending divestiture of Valchlor, one of the acquired products. The in-process research and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 9%.  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal first quarter ended April 2, 2017 as if Actelion had been acquired as of January 4, 2016.  The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets.  However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of Actelion.  Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future.



Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Results   (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) April 2, 2017   Net Sales $18,410Net Earnings 4,099Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share $1.49

In the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded acquisition related costs, of approximately $0.1 billion  before tax, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold. During the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion. The weighted average life of total amortizable intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment.Additionally, during the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX™ Reflux Management System for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools.

NOTE 11 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of April 1, 2018, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.



PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL®; XARELTO®; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder; and INVOKANA®. As of April 1, 2018, in the U.S. there were approximately 2,000 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 10,200 with respect to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; 54,000 with respect to pelvic meshes; 14,000 with respect to RISPERDAL®; 26,300 with respect to XARELTO®; 9,100 with respect to body powders containing talc; and 1,100 with respect to INVOKANA®.In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, with more expected from the recent extension, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions, and the proposed settlements will be presented for approval to the Québec Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia respectively in May 2018.  The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR™ Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson relating to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom.  In the United Kingdom, a trial was completed regarding common issues of liability and a decision is expected in the first half of 2018.  The Company has established an accrual for defense costs only in connection with product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System.Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below.

Medical Devices
In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE® ADVANCE and ACUVUE OASYS® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandt’s United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the District Court denied. In April 2016, the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI.  Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents.  Medinol is seeking damages and attorneys’ fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases and in April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the District Court to reconsider Medinol's motion for a new trial.In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE® Knee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants.  MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,558,426 (’426); 8,273,132; 8,721,730 and 9,492,280 relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAMTM Contact feature of the ATTUNE® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to invalidate the ’426 patent.In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product.

Pharmaceutical
In April 2016, MorphoSys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. MorphoSys alleges that JBI’s manufacture and sale of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) willfully infringes MorphoSys’ United States Patent Nos. 8,263,746, 9,200,061 and 9,785,590. MorphoSys is seeking money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX® from Genmab. Trial on liability and damages is scheduled to commence in February 2019.In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company (Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the Court entered a decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the Court’s decision and the injunction will be stayed pending the appeal.  In January 2018, the Court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the CJEU’s ruling on the issue.REMICADE® Related CasesIn August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent). In August 2016, the District Court granted both Celltrion's and Hospira's motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the ’471 patent.In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Although the ’083 patent is already asserted in the existing lawsuit against Celltrion, the additional lawsuit expands the claims to include the sale in the United States of Celltrion's biosimilar product manufactured with cell culture media made in the United States. This additional lawsuit against Celltrion has been consolidated with the existing lawsuit discussed above. Hospira has moved to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the ’083 patent as to it. Trial is scheduled to begin in July 2018.  The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions.The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched.Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by generic companies in conjunction with these ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge patents held by the Company’s subsidiaries.

In January 2018, the USPTO issued decisions finding the '438 patent claims unpatentable, and Janssen has requested rehearing.  The IPR decisions are not binding on the district court in the pending litigation.In October 2017, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) initiated two Notices of Application under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Teva Canada Limited (Teva) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Teva's filing Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) and seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA® 250mg and ZYTIGA® 500mg before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.

Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. In a case brought by Illinois, the parties are awaiting assignment of a trial date. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation.

Opioids Litigation

NOTE 12— RESTRUCTURING

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in today’s evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company is undertaking actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.4 billion.  In the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $107 million, of which $6 million was included in cost of products sold and $59 million was included in other (income) expense.   See the following table for additional details. Total project costs of $2.1 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 5 percent of the Medical Devices segment’s global workforce. Approximately 2,500 positions have been eliminated of which 1,800 received separation payments since the restructuring announcement.Subsequent to the fiscal first quarter, the Company announced plans on April 17, 2018, to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized.In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays.  These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.   The following table summarizes the severance related reserves and the associated spending under these restructuring programs through the fiscal three months of 2018:

*Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. **Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting the initiative and consulting expenses.The Company expects that the Medical Devices restructuring program will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018 with certain projects and severance charges continuing beyond that date.  The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments has extended due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects.  The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the recently announced Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place.  The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable.

The Baby Care franchise experienced an operational decline of 2.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter due to competitive pressure partially offset by geographic expansion in the Asia Pacific region.

The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products achieved operational growth of 4.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth of EDURANT®/rilpivirine, PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® and the launch of SYMTUZA®  was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA®.Neuroscience products experienced an operational decline of 0.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/ TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) were offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and generic competition for CONCERTA®/methylphenidate.Oncology products achieved strong operational sales growth of 37.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) and IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake and sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by market growth. A number of companies marketing generic pharmaceuticals have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of ZYTIGA® prior to expiration of its applicable patents.  These ANDAs include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents.   In February 2018, the court heard oral arguments on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by certain defendants, and the parties await a decision. If the decision is unfavorable, the stay could be lifted and a generic version of ZYTIGA® could enter the market.  A trial on the matter is scheduled for July 2018.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the legal matters regarding the ZYTIGA® patents.Pulmonary Hypertension is a new therapeutic area which was established with the acquisition of Actelion on June 16, 2017. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition. Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products achieved operational growth of 0.9% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) due to increased market share was partially offset by lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. primarily due to an increase in price discounts and market share decline driven by competitive pressure.

The Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 2.1% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, energy (including recent acquisitions) and biosurgery products. Operational growth in General Surgery was flat as compared to the prior year. The operational sales growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Advanced Sterilization products.The Orthopaedics franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 4.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. The decline was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture and share loss in Spine, competitive pressure in U.S. knees and market softness. This was partially offset by volume growth in U.S. hips and sales growth of trauma due to market growth and continued uptake of the TFN-ADVANCED™ nailing system in the U.S. coupled with strength of new products in Japan and tender timing in the Middle East.The Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 34.4% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter.  Operational growth was driven by sales from the acquisition of Abbot Medical Optics (AMO), with the majority of AMO sales in the surgical category, and new product launches in the contact lenses category. AMO, now referred to as the Vision Surgical business, was acquired on February 27, 2017.  The Interventional Solutions franchise (includes the Cerenovus business previously included in Spine and Other in Orthopaedics) achieved strong operational sales growth of 11.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter.  Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 19.5% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. Lower sales were primarily due to the Company's decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business, price declines in the U.S. and competitive pressure. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company announced a binding offer from Platinum Equity to acquire its LifeScan business.

ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME

Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was $5.5 billion representing 27.4% of sales as compared to $5.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2017, representing 31.4% of sales.Cost of Products Sold Consolidated costs of products sold for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 increased to 33.1% from 30.4% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by higher amortization expense and acquisition related costs, primarily related to Actelion and AMO. This was partially offset by favorable product mix. The intangible asset amortization expense for the fiscal three months of 2018 and 2017 was $1.1 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. Selling, Marketing and Administrative ExpensesConsolidated selling, marketing and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 decreased to 26.3% from 26.8% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to lower costs relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business partially offset by investments in recent acquisitions and new product launches in the Medical Devices segment. Research and Development ExpenseWorldwide costs of research and development activities for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 increased to 12.0% from 11.7% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to continued investment spending to advance the product development pipeline.  Interest (Income) ExpenseInterest income in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was lower than the same period a year ago due to lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period partially offset by higher average interest rates. The ending balance of cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities was $15.2 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2018, which is a decrease of $24.1 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired.Interest expense in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was higher as compared to the same period a year ago due to a higher average debt balance of $33.6 billion as compared to $29.7 billion a year ago. The Company’s debt position was $32.5 billion as of April 1, 2018 as compared to $32.4 billion the same period a year ago. Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was unfavorable by $0.3 billion as compared to the same period a year ago primarily attributable to higher gains in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 on the sale of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc.

EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR TAXES BY SEGMENT

Income before tax by segment of business for the fiscal first quarters were as follows:

(1) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer SegmentThe Consumer segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was 16.1% versus 18.5% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017 was attributable to higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to higher brand marketing expenses supporting the launch of new products.Pharmaceutical SegmentThe Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was 37.2% versus 44.4% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher amortization expense and other costs related to acquisitions. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 was 23.3% versus 24.8% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher amortization and other expenses related to acquisitions and increased spending for new product launches.







Restructuring

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The restructuring actions are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018. Approximately $500 million in savings were realized in 2017. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.4 billion. In the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $107 million, of which $6 million is included in cost of products sold and $59 million is included in other (income) expense. Restructuring charges of $2.1 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.  Subsequent to the first quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.

Provision for Taxes on Income

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the first fiscal three months of 2018 and 2017 were 20.3% and 20.7%, respectively. The Company estimates that the net impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) including the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate, offset by the elimination of the corporate income tax deductions, measurement period adjustments and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax, decreased the Company’s worldwide effective rate by approximately 1.0% to 2.0% compared to the same period of the prior year.  Provisional amounts recorded as part of the adoption of the TCJA and estimates used to develop the current quarter's effective tax rate may require further adjustments and changes to the Company’s estimates as new guidance is made available. These estimates are subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provision of the TCJA, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns.  Revisions to the provisional charge may be material to the Company's future financial results.See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the impact of the TCJA and adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in fiscal 2017. The Company completed its acquisition of AMO in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, and incurred incremental tax costs that were discretely recorded in the first quarter of 2017, which increased the effective tax rate by 3.8% for the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2018.  Additionally, the Company had more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017.  Remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets recorded for the foreign withholding taxes and related U.S. foreign tax credits, respectively, increased the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 1.4% due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. These increases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by additional tax benefits received from stock-based compensation that either vested or were exercised during the fiscal three months of 2018 and 2017, which reduced the effective tax rate by 2.2% and 3.6%, respectively.As of April 1, 2018, the Company had approximately $3.2 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. The Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for more detailed information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.







LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $14.6 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2018 as compared with $17.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.2 billion decrease were approximately $3.6 billion of cash generated from operating activities and $0.1 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents offset by $0.9 billion net cash used by investing activities and $6.0 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $0.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2018 and $0.5 billion at the end of 2017.Cash flow from operations of $3.6 billion was the result of $4.4 billion of net earnings and $2.0 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred tax provision, reduced by $3.4 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in inventories, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in other current and non-current assets.  Additional sources of operating cash flow of $0.6 billion resulted from an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. Investing activities use of $0.9 billion of cash was primarily used for additions to property, plant and equipment of $0.7 billion, $0.2 billion from the net purchases of investments in marketable securities and acquisitions of $0.1 billion. Financing activities use of $6.0 billion of cash was primarily used for the net retirement of short term debt of $2.5 billion, $2.3 billion for dividends to shareholders and repurchase of common stock of $1.4 billion. Financing activities also included a source of $0.2 billion from other financing and proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2017, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company under the facility, which expires September 13, 2018, approximates $10.0 billion. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.In the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.  The Company filed a shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. DividendsOn January 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.84 per share, payable on March 13, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2018. On April 26, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on June 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 29, 2018. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.

OTHER INFORMATION

New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process to leave the E.U.  Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of April 1, 2018, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal three months revenues, respectively.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA, initiated inter partes review proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in these actions, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3 — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its presentation set forth in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.


Item 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.Internal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.

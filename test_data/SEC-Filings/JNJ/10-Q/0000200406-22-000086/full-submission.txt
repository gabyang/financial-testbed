CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and other benefits; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;
•The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;



•Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials;
•Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation;

•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
•The Company’s ability to consummate the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely basis or at all;

•The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic;



•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company’s products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 — The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022. The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.

Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.

Use of Estimates
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, inflation, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of October 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended October 2, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

New Accounting Standards
The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
There were no new material accounting standards adopted in the fiscal third quarter of 2022.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of October 2, 2022

NOTE 3 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The latest annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021. Future impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner, if warranted.

(1)The change in intangible assets with definite lives is primarily the result of currency translation effects.(2)The majority is comprised of customer relationships(3)In the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for AD. The remaining reduction was driven by assets that reached commercialization and are now classified as having definite lives.In October 2022, subsequent to the fiscal third quarter, additional information regarding efficacy of the HS indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for HS. The Company will record a charge of approximately $0.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter related to this impairment.  The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020.


Goodwill as of October 2, 2022 was allocated by segment of business as follows:

The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets included in cost of products sold was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion for the fiscal third quarters ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets included in cost of products sold was $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion for the fiscal nine months ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.

NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of October 2, 2022, the cumulative amount of cash collateral received by the Company under the CSA amounted to $0.8 billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of October 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $47.1 billion, $36.2 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $45.8 billion,  $37.4 billion and $10.0 billion respectively.All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of October 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $922 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

For equity investments without readily determinable market values, there was a decrease of $29 million in the fair value reflected in net income as a result of impairments. In the fiscal third quarter ended October 2, 2022, the Company sold all its equity investments in argenx SE for proceeds of $0.6 billion.Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal nine months of 2022 and 2021 were 17.7% and 10.0%, respectively. This increase in the consolidated tax rate as compared to the prior year fiscal nine months is primarily due to the Company reorganizing the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the second fiscal quarter of 2021.  As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with the applicable local regulations. Accordingly, the Company recorded a local deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion which was partially offset by a related increase in the U.S. GILTI deferred tax liability of approximately $1.7 billion. The net impact of this reorganization was an approximate $0.6 billion net benefit or a 3.4% decrease to the effective tax rate of the fiscal nine months of 2021.  Additionally, the following items had an unfavorable impact to the Company’s year-to-date effective tax rate as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year:•as part of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business (for further information see Note 1 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022) the Company has recognized approximately $0.4 billion in net incremental tax costs which increased the rate by approximately 2.0% for the fiscal nine months of 2022 •certain one-time favorable tax items that occurred during the fiscal nine months of  2021 and resulted in an approximate 1.0% benefit to the effective tax rate, but were not repeated in fiscal 2022 •In the fiscal third quarter of 2021 the Company had accrued additional Talc expenses of $1.4 billion at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and $0.8 billion for the Risperdal Gynecomastia settlement at an effective tax rate of 16.4%. (See note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details)•in the fiscal third quarter of 2021 the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%The Company also had additional tax benefits received from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or vested during the first three fiscal quarters of 2022 and 2021.  The Company’s 2022 tax rate benefited primarily from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022, the impairment of bermekimab for AD IPR&D (for further information see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) and changes in the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate.As of October 2, 2022, the Company had approximately $3.8 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016.  In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 11 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of  October 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.



PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; XARELTO; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder; INVOKANA; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh. As of October 2, 2022, in the United States there were approximately 180 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400 with respect to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,400 with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,500 with respect to RISPERDAL; 600 with respect to XARELTO; 40,300 with respect to body powders containing talc; 5 with respect to INVOKANA;  4,800 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; and 1,900 with respect to ELMIRON. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR

Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Prior to 2019, several adverse verdicts had been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia  and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court issued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the intermediate appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full Court entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An application for special leave to the High Court of Australia was filed in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on the application in November 2021. Special leave was refused. In September 2022, the Company reached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court approval. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the settlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in Oklahoma state court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of October 2022, there are approximately 154 active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.

Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States. Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System products.Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $6.8 million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases were filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson & Johnson announced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation.A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase. In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to  $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company.  The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).

In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. While the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court’s order effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed.The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After and as a result of the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.A class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey state court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that J&J fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc mined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by Johnson & Johnson’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor Minerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the Edley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court. In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds.  In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn. In October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of Imerys’s insurers (the Mediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The term of the mediation ended in September 2022.In July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys Adversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding.In June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC)  (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy

seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding. In June 2022, Cyprus commenced an Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case seeking an order enforcing the automatic stay by enjoining parties from commencing or continuing “talc-related claims” against CAMC. In June 2022, the court entered a preliminary injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-related claims against CAMC through January 2023.In February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the Coverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the automatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic stay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a limited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the LTL automatic stay applied to the Coverage Action.In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. In March 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to stay the securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants filed a second motion to supplement the class certification record.  In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the securities class action. Plaintiff has appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order.In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation. In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and demanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in the In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation. The independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily terminated Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss pending a decision on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In July 2022, the Court denied Plaintiff’s discovery motion. In August 2022, the Court reopened Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss. In lieu of opposing, Plaintiff made a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case, which the Court granted in October 2022.In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of October 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to file an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in September

In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.

MedTech
In August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (collectively, Intuitive) filed a patent infringement suit against Auris Health, Inc. (Auris) in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In the suit, Intuitive alleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos.  6,522,906 (’906); 6,800,056 (’056); 8,142,447 (’447);  and 9,452,276

(’276) based on Auris’ MONARCH Platform. Auris filed IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) regarding the  ’056,  ’447, ’276 and ’906 patents.  In December 2019, the USPTO  denied review of the ’056 patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the  ’447,  and ’906 patents and denied review of the ’276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the ’447 and ’906 patents are not invalid. Auris appealed, and  in April 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the decision that the ’447 patent was not invalid and remanded the decision  to the USPTO for further review.  In May 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirmed the ruling that claim 53 of the ’906 patent was not invalid, vacated the decision that the remaining claims of the ’906 patent were not invalid and remanded the decision  to the USPTO for further review. Auris filed a request for reexamination of the ’276 patent in November 2021, and in January 2022, the USPTO granted the reexamination request. Trial is scheduled to begin in September 2023.

Pharmaceutical
Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)The following summarizes lawsuits the Company’s subsidiaries have brought against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.

Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.

Opioid Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against Johnson & Johnson and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied. Plaintiffs appealed the judgment, but later filed a request to dismiss the appeal after electing to participate in the national settlement agreement. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of  $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2022, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The terms provided a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and,

thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on expected participation, the Company committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states, five territories, the District of Columbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in the settlement, and the Company confirmed that the level of participation was sufficient to proceed with the agreement as to all participants. The agreement was effective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company entered into settlement agreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating subdivisions. In September 2022, the Company also reached a settlement agreement with the State of New Hampshire and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by September 2022, the Company had settled the opioid claims advanced by all states except Washington.There are approximately 60 cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately 860 remaining federal cases against Johnson & Johnson and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report.In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020.  By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for reconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order.

In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in December 2021. The relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for reconsideration, which the District Court

denied. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with prejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, which the District Court denied except as to costs. The Relators have appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the case to the First Circuit. The briefing on the appeal will be complete by the end of October 2022.In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states:  Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In April 2020, the Company settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky matter is scheduled for May 2023. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. In January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $344 million. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company’s motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $344 million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company appealed the penalty judgment. In April 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $302 million, but otherwise denied the appeal. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company’s petition to review the Court of Appeals decision, and the Company recorded a charge to reflect the judgment in the second quarter of 2022. The Company plans to petition for review by the United States Supreme Court.In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Johnson & Johnson and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was barred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson & Johnson and JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. In August 2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling of April 2021. In December 2021 the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari. After the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected to any trial setting as barred by the stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above, while the State argued that the stay did not apply. In January 2022, the Court granted the State’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, given the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until May 2022. The temporary stay expired in May 2022. LTL thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The Company moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements. The Company has not received any follow

NOTE 12— RESTRUCTURING

In the fiscal second quarter of 2018 the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In the fiscal third quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $123 million, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $82 million in restructuring, $13 million in cost of products sold and $28 million in other (income) expense, net.  In the fiscal nine months of 2022, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $323 million, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $237 million in restructuring, $46 million in cost of products sold and $40 million in other (income) expense, net. Total project costs of approximately $2.1 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program. In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.7 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion by the completion of the program in December 2022. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.


The following table summarizes the severance related reserves and the associated restructuring expenses through the fiscal third quarter of 2022:

(1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out by the completion of the program in December 2022. (2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses.(3) Represents gain on sale of assets

The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable.

The growth was driven by price actions and increased Cough/Cold/Flu and pediatric fever incidences as well as category recovery. This was partially offset by U.S. supply constraints.The Skin Health/Beauty franchise achieved operational growth of 5.0% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The growth was driven by price actions, market growth and increased demand outside the U.S. for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to strong new product introductions.The Oral Care franchise experienced an operational decline of 0.7% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The decline was driven by softer consumption in China, category deceleration in the EMEA and Latin America regions, and suspension of personal care products in Russia. This was partially offset by price actions in the U.S.The Baby Care franchise achieved operational growth of 1.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The growth was driven by price actions, market growth and AVEENO Baby facial cream relaunch in the Asia Pacific region. This was partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. The Women’s Health franchise achieved operational growth of 7.9% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter primarily driven by continued strong performance in India, price actions, and lapping prior year supply disruption due to flooding in EMEA.The Wound Care/Other franchise experienced an operational decline of 2.5% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter primarily driven by timing of club sales in Canada, U.S. market declines and lapping prior year strong COVID-19 related demand.

Additionally, strong growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and  share gains in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.  The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales.  Infectious disease products achieved operational growth of 3.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 5.9% as compared to the same period a year ago. Growth of Paliperidone long-acting injectables INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA was due to new patient starts and persistence of treatment as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA. Oncology products achieved operational sales growth of 20.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains in all regions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation and the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) sales declined due to competitive pressures. Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 3.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth was due to demand and share gains from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by COVID-19 related market constraints and unfavorable patient mix in OPSUMIT (macitentan) as well as continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products achieved operational growth of 1.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. The growth of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) was primarily driven by volume growth and share gains. The decline in sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) were due to continued share erosion.Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. The updated policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain unlimited contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy update has discount and volume implications in the current year and going forward.

*Previously referred to as Medical DevicesThe Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 7.1% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the following: Endocutter market recovery and new products partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.; Biosurgery market recovery, market expansion efforts and the success of new products partially offset by strong U.S. market demand in the prior year for infection prevention products; and Energy products driven by new product penetration coupled with competitive supply challenges partially offset by competitive pressures. The operational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and technology penetration. The Orthopaedics franchise achieved operational sales growth of 4.7% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The operational growth in hips reflects procedure recovery, continued strength from the portfolio including ACTIS Stem and PINNACLE Dual Mobility, driven by KINCISE and VELYS Hip Navigation and momentum in the U.S. Ambulatory Surgery Center channel. This was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and the timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in knees was primarily driven by procedure recovery, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in Trauma was driven by market recovery and the uptake of new products. The operational growth in Spine, Sports & Other reflects procedure recovery and the benefit from new products in Spine, Sports, Shoulders and VELYS Digital Solutions. This was partially offset by competitive pressures in Spine. The Vision franchise achieved operational sales growth of 8.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The Contact Lenses/Other operational growth was primarily driven by market recovery, price actions, commercial execution andnew products as well as the benefit of stocking in the U.S. related to new product launches. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the success of new products mostly offset by global supply challenges, a high prior year comparison in Refractive lenses and timing of stocking in ASPAC.  The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved operational sales growth of 17.7% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The double digit growth in all regions was driven by continued market recovery, new product performanceand commercial execution.

Restructuring

In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth.

In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.7 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.2 to $2.3 billion by the completion of the program in December 2022. In the first fiscal nine months of 2022, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $323 million, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $237 million in restructuring, $46 million in cost of products sold and $40 million in other (income) expense, net.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rates as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.As of October 2, 2022, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately $34.1 billion and approximately $32.0 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net cash position of $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year net debt position of $2.9 billion. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $0.5 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.8 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.  The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. Through September 30, 2022, $2.0 billion has been repurchased under the program.In the fiscal nine months of 2022, the Company paid approximately $2.1 billion to the U.S. Treasury which included $0.8 billion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022) and $1.3 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payments for the fiscal nine months of 2022.During the fiscal third quarter ended October 2, 2022, the Company sold all of its shares in argenx SE for proceeds of $0.6 billion.DividendsOn July 18, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on September 6, 2022 to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2022.

OTHER INFORMATION

New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.Economic and Market FactorsCOVID-19 considerations and business continuityThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:•Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities. •Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to ensure adequate and effective distribution. •Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.  •Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees. •Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future. •Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. In the fiscal third quarter of 2022, amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $0.5 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other and the accrued liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations. Based on the global progress on vaccine development and distribution as well as the amount of existing global supply, the Company is modifying its COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all customer contractual commitments which will result in incremental costs for the year. The Company continues to evaluate the global demand for the COVID-19 vaccine and its related supply.The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements. The Company has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in Leiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites have been involved in the production of the vaccine across different countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption relating to vaccine manufacturing, or the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results.Russia-Ukraine WarAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal third quarter and nine months of 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of both the 2021 fiscal year ending January 2, 2022, and the fiscal third quarter ending October 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the 2021 fiscal year ending January 2, 2022, and the fiscal third quarter ending October 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.In early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply of personal care products in Russia.  The Company continued to supply its other products throughout the third quarter as patients rely on many of the products for healthcare purposes. The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela and Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact on the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.

Item 3 — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its presentation set forth in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.



Item 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.Internal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 — The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in the update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt this standard. The update requires the following changes to presentation of the financial statements:•All excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a reduction or an increase to the provision for taxes on income. Previously, the Company recorded these benefits directly to Retained Earnings. The tax benefit for the Company was $123 million and $288 million for the fiscal second quarter and fiscal six months ended for 2016, respectively. The standard does not permit retroactive presentation of this benefit to prior fiscal years on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. •The tax benefit or deficiency is required to be classified and presented as a cash flow to/from operating activities. It was previously required to be presented as a cash flow to/from financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  As permitted in the standard, the Company has elected to adopt this reclassification on a prospective basis and therefore prior fiscal years for the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have not been recast for this provision.  •Clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on employees’ share-based compensation should be classified as a cash outflow from financing activities. This reclassification is required to be recast retrospectively. As a result, $262 million and $272 million of cash outflow was reclassified from an operating activity to a financing activity (Proceeds from the exercise of stock options/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net) for the first fiscal six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. •In the diluted net earnings per share calculation, when applying the treasury stock method for shares that could be repurchased, the assumed proceeds no longer include the amount of excess tax benefit. This did not have a material impact on the Company's diluted net earnings per share calculation.During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16 Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. This update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This update requires capitalized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction to the carrying value of debt instead of being classified as a deferred charge, as currently required. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied retroactively for all periods presented. This update did not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial position.During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10: Development Stage Entities: Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entity Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.  The change in the current guidance will require the Company to determine if it should consolidate one of these entities based on the change in the consolidation analysis.  This update to the consolidation analysis became effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of July 3, 2016

During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  The amendments in the update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held.  The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the application of the equity method. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles.  This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial position.During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard replaces substantially all current revenue recognition accounting guidance. During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral to the effective date to be adopted by all public companies for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification relating to Identifying Performance Obligations, Licensing, and Principal verses Agent Considerations.  During the second quarter of 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification  relating to assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and contract modifications & completed contracts at transition. Early adoption of this standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.During the fiscal third quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard requires management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around management’s plan to alleviate these doubts are required. This update will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016.  This standard is not expected to have any impact on current disclosures in the financial statements.

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The latest annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Future impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner, if warranted.

NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a  foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings.The Company also uses equity collar contracts to manage exposure to market risk associated with certain equity investments.     All three types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.  The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.  Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features or requirements to post collateral (excluding equity collar contracts) by either the Company or the counter-party. For equity collar contracts, the Company pledged the underlying hedged marketable equity securities to the counter-party as collateral.  On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of July 3, 2016, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and equity collar contracts of $31.6 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.2 billion, and $0.5 billion respectively.All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account.  On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts.  For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense.  For the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material.During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a $116 million pretax gain reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.As of July 3, 2016, the balance of deferred net losses on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $365 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal second quarters in 2016 and 2015:

Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value.The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of July 3, 2016 and January 3, 2016 were as follows:

NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the first fiscal six months of 2016 and 2015 were 17.1% and 21.9%, respectively. In the fiscal six months of 2016, the Company had higher income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions as compared to 2015, which decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 1.7%.  As described in Note 1, the Company adopted a new accounting standard for the reporting of tax benefits on share-based compensation. The adoption of this new standard reduced the tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2016 by approximately 2.8% versus 2015. The remainder of the change from prior year was primarily related to the U.S. Research & Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through provisions, which were not enacted into law until the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, and the settlement of certain open tax positions in several international jurisdictions.As of July 3, 2016, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. The Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 11 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of July 3, 2016, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.



PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.The most significant of these cases include the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System, the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System, pelvic meshes, RISPERDAL®, XARELTO® and JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder. As of July 3, 2016, in the U.S. there were approximately 2,900 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System, 9,100 with respect to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System, 50,100 with respect to pelvic meshes, 13,000 with respect to RISPERDAL®, 13,900 with respect to XARELTO® and 1,700 with respect to JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder.In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR™ Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. This settlement covered approximately 8,000 patients. In February 2015, DePuy reached an additional agreement, which effectively extends the existing settlement program to ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 1, 2015. This second agreement is estimated to cover approximately 1,800 additional patients. The estimated cost of these agreements is covered by existing accruals. This settlement program is expected to bring to a close significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, many lawsuits in the United States will remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a settlement has been reached with representatives of a class action lawsuit pending in the Federal Court of New South Wales that resolves the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the DePuy ASR™ Hip program and related product liability litigation. Changes to these accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson relating to DePuy's PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with DePuy's PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in countries outside of the United States, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland and Venezuela, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL®, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related compounds. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with RISPERDAL®. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of XARELTO®, an oral anticoagulant. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States and many cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with XARELTO®. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder.  The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri and New Jersey. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below.

Medical Devices
In November 2007, Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc., et al. (Roche) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against LifeScan, Inc. (LifeScan) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging LifeScan's OneTouch® Line of Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems infringe two patents related to the use of microelectrode sensors. Roche is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In September 2009, LifeScan obtained a favorable ruling on claim construction that precluded a finding of infringement. Roche appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's ruling on claim construction and remanded the case to the District Court for new findings on the issue. In December 2014, the District Court ruled in LifeScan's favor and reinstated the original claim construction. In February 2015, Roche appealed the ruling, and in February 2016, oral argument took place at the Court of Appeals. In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVC) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVC's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE ADVANCE® and ACUVUE OASYS® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringe their U.S. Patent No. 5,712,327 (the '327 patent). Rembrandt is seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. In May 2012, the jury returned a verdict holding that neither of the accused lenses infringes the '327 patent. Rembrandt appealed, and in August 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. Rembrandt asked the District Court to grant it a new trial based on alleged new evidence, and in July 2014, the District Court denied Rembrandt’s motion. Rembrandt appealed and the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling in April 2016 and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. JJVC filed a motion to reconsider the decision, which was denied.In December 2009, the State of Israel filed a lawsuit in the District Court in Tel Aviv Jaffa against Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and various affiliates (Omrix). In the lawsuit, the State claims that an employee of a government-owned hospital was the inventor on several patents related to fibrin glue technology that the employee developed while he was a government employee. The State claims that he had no right to transfer any intellectual property to Omrix because it belongs to the State. The State is seeking damages plus royalties on QUIXIL™ and EVICEL® products, or alternatively, transfer of the patents to the State. The case remains active, but no trial date has been set.In September 2011, LifeScan, Inc. (LifeScan) filed a lawsuit against Shasta Technologies, LLC (Shasta), Instacare Corp (now Pharmatech Solutions, Inc. (Pharmatech)) and Conductive Technologies, Inc. (Conductive) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for patent infringement and false advertising for the making and marketing of a strip for use in LifeScan's OneTouch® Blood Glucose Meters. The defendants alleged that the three LifeScan patents-in-suit are invalid and challenged the validity of the asserted patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In April 2013, the defendants brought counterclaims for alleged antitrust violations and false advertising and those claims were stayed pending resolution of the patent infringement case. The validity of two of the patents was confirmed by the USPTO, but the USPTO determined that the third patent, U.S. Patent No. 7,250,105, is invalid. LifeScan lost an appeal of that decision, but is seeking a rehearing. LifeScan entered into a settlement agreement with Shasta and Conductive. A motion brought by Pharmatech for summary judgment of patent invalidity was denied. In April 2016, LifeScan and Pharmatech entered into a settlement agreement and the case was dismissed.LifeScan filed a patent infringement lawsuit against UniStrip Technologies, LLC (UniStrip) in the United States District Court for the District of North Carolina in May 2014, alleging that the making and marketing of UniStrip’s strips for use in LifeScan’s blood glucose monitors infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,241,862 (the ‘862 patent) and 7,250,105 (the ‘105 patent). In August 2014, the USPTO determined that the ‘105 patent is invalid. In January 2016, the invalidity decision was upheld on appeal. LifeScan filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied. In July 2014, UniStrip brought a lawsuit against LifeScan in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging antitrust violations relating to marketing practices for LifeScan strips.In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that all of Cordis's sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ Stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents.  Medinol is seeking damages and attorney's fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims, and Medinol did not appeal the decision. In September 2014, the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol's appeal of this decision has been dismissed. Medinol has filed a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. Following the divestiture of Cordis, the Company retains any liability that may result from this case.

Pharmaceutical
In 2012 and 2013, Noramco, Inc. (Noramco) moved to intervene in several patent infringement lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Purdue Pharma L.P. and others (Purdue) against Noramco oxycodone customers, Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Amneal), Watson Laboratories, Inc.- Florida (Watson) and Andrx Labs, LLC (Andrx). The lawsuits are in response to the defendants' respective Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking approval to market generic extended release oxycodone products before the expiration of certain Purdue patents. Three of the asserted patents relate to oxycodone and processes for making oxycodone, and Noramco agreed to defend the lawsuits on behalf of Impax, Teva, Amneal, Watson, and Andrx. In April 2013, Watson and Andrx entered into a settlement with Purdue. The trial against Impax and Teva (and others) took place in September 2013, and Noramco defended Teva and Impax. In November 2013, Impax entered into a settlement with Purdue, and in December 2014, Teva entered into a settlement with Purdue. The District Court issued a decision in January 2014 invalidating the relevant Purdue patents and, based on that decision, subsequently dismissed the lawsuit against Amneal (and other parties not defended by Noramco). Purdue appealed the Court's decision. In February 2016, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court decision invalidating the Purdue patents. Purdue filed a petition for rehearing and the petition was denied. In December 2015, Purdue filed another patent infringement action against Amneal in the District of Delaware asserting, among others, the three above-referenced patents and a newly issued patent relating to oxycodone and processes for making oxycodone. Noramco was divested in July 2016 and, as a result, the Company is no longer involved in the defense of these actions.Johnson & Johnson acquired the prostate cancer business of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aragon), including ARN-509, a compound being tested for treatment of prostate cancer, in September 2013. Prior to the acquisition, in May 2011, Medivation, Inc. (Medivation) had sued Aragon and the University of California seeking rights to ARN-509. In December 2012, the state court granted summary judgment to Aragon on Medivation's claims, awarding the rights of the ARN-509 compound to Aragon, and in January 2013, the Court dismissed the case against Aragon. Medivation has appealed. In April 2016, Morphosys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that JBI’s manufacture and sale of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) willfully infringes its U.S. Patent No. 8,263,746. Morphosys is seeking money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX® from Genmab. In June 2016, JBI filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.REMICADE® Related Cases



U.S. Proceedings
In September 2013, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU) received an Office Action from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejecting the claims in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (the '471 patent) in a reexamination proceeding instituted by a third party.  The '471 patent is co-owned by JBI and NYU, and NYU granted JBI an exclusive license to NYU’s rights under the patent. The '471 patent in the United States expires in September 2018. Following several office actions by the patent examiner, including two further rejections, and responses by JBI, the USPTO issued a further action maintaining its rejection of the '471 patent. In May 2015, JBI filed a notice of appeal to the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and the appeal is currently pending. The '471 patent remains a valid and enforceable patent as it undergoes reexamination at the USPTO. In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (together, Celltrion) filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own biosimilar version of REMICADE®. In March 2015, JBI filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Celltrion's biosimilar version of REMICADE®, seeking a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents and that defendants failed to comply with certain procedural requirements of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In addition, JBI moved for an injunction to prohibit Celltrion and Hospira from launching their biosimilar product until 180 days after they had given JBI a Notice of Commercial Marketing under the BPCIA, such notice not to be given before FDA approval of Celltrion's product. JBI's motion to stay all proceedings in the District Court with respect to the ‘471 patent, pending the outcome of the USPTO reexamination proceeding discussed above, was denied in May 2016. In February 2016, Celltrion and Hospira filed two motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ‘471 patent, which will be argued in August 2016. In April 2016, the FDA approved Celltrion’s biosimilar version of REMICADE® for sale in the United States. Celltrion and Hospira have agreed not to launch their biosimilar product before October 3, 2016, 180 days after the FDA's approval of their biosimilar product, thereby eliminating litigation of the issue of the 180-day Notice of Commercial Marketing under the BPCIA.In June 2016, JBI filed two new patent infringement lawsuits asserting U.S. Patent No. 7,598,083 (the '083 patent), one against Celltrion in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Although the '083 patent is already asserted in the existing lawsuit against Celltrion, the new lawsuit against Celltrion expands the claims to include any use of the cell media made in the United States to manufacture Celltrion's biosimilar. The new lawsuit against Celltrion has been consolidated with the existing Massachusetts lawsuit. The Court has scheduled a claim construction hearing regarding the '083 patent for August 2016.  In the United States, if either of the REMICADE® related patents discussed above is found to be invalid following all appeals, such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the introduction of biosimilar versions of REMICADE®. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. The timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights and compliance with the 180-day Notice of Commercial Marketing provisions of the BPCIA. There is a risk that Celltrion and Hospira could launch their biosimilar version of REMICADE® on or after October 3, 2016, even though one or more valid patents are in place and JBI will continue to assert its patent rights. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.

Canadian Proceedings
In March 2013, Hospira filed an impeachment proceeding against The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology (Kennedy) challenging the validity of a Canadian patent related to REMICADE® (a Feldman patent), which is exclusively licensed to JBI. In October 2013, Kennedy, along with JBI, Janssen Inc. (Janssen) and Cilag GmbH International (both affiliates of JBI), filed a counterclaim for infringement against Celltrion and Hospira. The counterclaim alleges that the products described in Celltrion’s and Hospira’s marketing applications to Health Canada for their subsequent entry biologics (SEB) to REMICADE® would infringe the Feldman patents owned by Kennedy. Discovery in the patent action is ongoing, and trial has been scheduled for September 2016.In January 2014, Health Canada approved Celltrion’s SEB to REMICADE®, allowing Celltrion to market its biosimilar version of REMICADE® in Canada, regardless of the pending patent action. In June 2014, Health Canada approved Hospira’s SEB to REMICADE®. In July 2014, Janssen filed a lawsuit to compel the Canadian Minister of Health to withdraw the Notice of Compliance for Hospira’s SEB because Hospira did not serve a Notice of Allegation on Janssen to address the patent listed by Janssen on the Patent Register. In March 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby Health Canada agreed to a Consent Judgment setting aside Hospira’s Notice of Compliance, subject to Health Canada's appeal, which was filed in June 2015. Nevertheless, Hospira began marketing a biosimilar version of REMICADE® as a distributor under Celltrion's Notice of Compliance. A hearing on the appeal concluded in June 2016 and the parties are awaiting a decision. In Canada, if any of the REMICADE® related patents discussed above is found to be invalid following all appeals, such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the further introduction of biosimilar versions of REMICADE®.Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.

PREZISTA®
In November 2010, Tibotec, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to Janssen Products, LP) and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (predecessor-in-interest to Janssen Sciences Ireland UC) (individually or collectively, with one or more affiliates and successors-in-interest, Janssen) filed a series of patent infringement lawsuits, relating to several patents owned by Janssen or licensed to Janssen from G.D. Searle, against Lupin, Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together, Lupin) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in response to Lupin's ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Tibotec's PREZISTA® product in various dosage strengths before the expiration of patents relating to PREZISTA®. In June 2013, Lupin, agreed not to seek FDA approval of its ANDA until the November 2017 expiration of the G.D. Searle patents. After a trial regarding the remaining patents, the Court issued a decision in August 2014, holding that the asserted patents are valid and would be infringed by Lupin's marketing of its proposed products. Lupin appealed. In May 2013, Lupin notified Janssen that it filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a new dosage strength of its generic version of PREZISTA®. In response, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Lupin's new dosage strength would infringe the same patents that Janssen is asserting against Lupin in the original action. In March 2014, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 8,518,987 (the ‘987 patent). In January 2015, the Court stayed these cases pending Lupin's appeal of the Court's August 2014 decision in the first action. In April 2015, Lupin filed a petition for Inter Partes review in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeking to invalidate the ‘987 patent, which was denied in October 2015. In January 2016, Lupin amended its ANDA to reflect a new formulation of darunavir that Lupin alleges does not infringe the relevant Janssen patents. In February 2016, Janssen filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey asserting that Lupin’s new formulation of darunavir infringes the relevant Janssen patents.In the above lawsuits, Janssen sought orders enjoining Lupin from marketing its generic versions of PREZISTA® before the expiration of the relevant patents. In May 2016, Janssen and Lupin entered into a confidential settlement agreement, pursuant to which the above lawsuits have been dismissed.



CONCERTA®
In December 2014, Janssen Inc. and ALZA Corporation filed a Notice of Application against Actavis Pharma Company (Actavis) in response to Actavis’ Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA® before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,264,852 (the ‘852 patent). The hearing is scheduled for September 2016. Janssen and ALZA are seeking an order enjoining Actavis from marketing its generic version of CONCERTA® before the expiration of the ‘852 patent.

ZYTIGA®
In June and July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received notices of paragraph IV certification from several companies advising of their respective ANDAs seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of one or more patents relating to ZYTIGA®. In July 2015, JBI, Janssen Oncology, Inc. (Janssen Oncology) and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against several generic ANDA applicants (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) in response to their respective ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 5,604,213 (the '213 patent) (expiring December 2016) and/or 8,822,438 (the '438 patent) (expiring August 2027). The generic companies include Actavis Laboratories, FL, Inc. (Actavis); Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy's); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward); and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). The Court entered a stay of the lawsuit against Par and Citron, as each agreed to be bound by the decision against the other defendants in the action. In February 2016, the Court set a trial date of October 2017.In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, which has been stayed.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.

Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In June 2007, after a trial on the merits, the MDL Court dismissed the claims of two of the plaintiff classes against the J&J AWP Defendants. In March 2011, the Court dismissed the claims of the third class against the J&J AWP Defendants without prejudice.AWP cases brought by various Attorneys General have proceeded to trial against other manufacturers. Several state cases against certain Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries have been settled, including the case in Wisconsin, which settled in February 2016. Cases are still pending in Illinois, New Jersey, and Utah. The cases in Illinois and New Jersey have not yet proceeded to trial. In Utah, the claims brought by the Attorney General were dismissed by the Court in 2013, but the State may appeal the dismissal after the conclusion of similar pending matters against other defendants. In the AWP case against the J&J AWP Defendants brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, following a trial in 2010, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court found in favor of the Commonwealth with regard to certain of its claims under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, and in favor of the J&J AWP Defendants on the Commonwealth’s remaining claims.  Following an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that vacated that judgment, the Commonwealth Court entered a subsequent judgment in favor of the J&J AWP Defendants on all claims.  That subsequent judgment has been upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a successive appeal.

McNeil Consumer Healthcare
Starting in June 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division) (McNeil Consumer Healthcare) and certain affiliates, including Johnson & Johnson (the Companies), received grand jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania requesting documents broadly relating to recalls of various products of McNeil Consumer Healthcare, and the FDA inspections of the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania and Lancaster, Pennsylvania manufacturing facilities, as well as certain documents relating to recalls of a small number of products of other subsidiaries. In addition, in February 2011, the government served McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI) with a Civil Investigative Demand seeking records relevant to its investigation to determine if there was a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. In March 2015, McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now JJCI) entered a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to a misdemeanor violation of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now JJCI) agreed to pay a $20 million fine and a $5 million forfeiture to resolve the matter.The Companies have also received Civil Investigative Demands from multiple State Attorneys General Offices broadly relating to the McNeil recall issues. The Companies continue to cooperate with these inquiries, which are being coordinated through a multi-state coalition. If a resolution cannot be reached with this multi-state coalition, it is possible that individual State Attorneys General Offices may file civil monetary claims against the Companies. In January 2011, the Oregon Attorney General filed a civil complaint against Johnson & Johnson, McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now JJCI) and McNeil Healthcare LLC in state court alleging civil violations of the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act relating to an earlier recall of a McNeil OTC product. In November 2012, the state court granted a motion by the Companies to dismiss Oregon's complaint in its entirety, with prejudice. In November 2015, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon reversed the trial court and reinstated Oregon's consumer protection claims. In February 2016, the Oregon Supreme Court denied the Companies' petition for review, and the case was sent back to the trial court.
Opioids Litigation
Along with other pharmaceutical companies, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) have been named in three lawsuits alleging claims related to marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®, NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER.  In May 2014, Santa Clara and Orange Counties in California filed a complaint in state court in Orange County, California against numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, including J&J and JPI, alleging claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, and public nuisance. The counties seek injunctive and monetary relief. In February 2015, the defendants filed motions challenging the sufficiency of the complaint. In August 2015, the Court stayed the case until the FDA concludes its ongoing inquiry into the safety and effectiveness of long-term opioid treatment. In June 2014, the City of Chicago filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court against the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including J&J and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including consumer fraud violations and false claims, and seeking injunctive and monetary relief. The case was later removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In December 2014, J&J and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the City of Chicago's First Amended Complaint, which was granted with leave to file an amended complaint. The City filed an amended complaint, and in November 2015, J&J and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.In September 2014, the Tennessee Attorney General Division of Consumer Affairs issued a Request for Information to JPI and other pharmaceutical companies related to opioids marketing practices.In August 2015, the New Hampshire Attorney General, Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau issued a subpoena to JPI and other pharmaceutical companies related to opioids marketing practices. In October 2015, the State filed a motion in the State of New Hampshire Superior Court to enforce the subpoena. JPI and the other pharmaceutical companies subsequently filed a joint motion for injunctive relief and a protective order to preclude the State from engaging private contingent fee counsel to participate in the State’s investigation or any subsequent enforcement action. In March 2016, the Court denied the State’s motion to enforce the subpoena and granted the protective order on the grounds that the State had not obtained requisite executive and legislative approvals to retain private counsel, but rejected the contention that the contingency fee agreement was otherwise unlawful. All parties have appealed the March 2016 ruling to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. In the interim, in May 2016, the New Hampshire Attorney General’s office obtained executive and legislative approvals to retain private counsel for the State’s investigation. In June 2016, in response to the State’s renewed demand (through its private counsel) to produce documents responsive to the subpoenas, JPI and the other pharmaceutical companies filed a joint motion to enforce the protective order. In December 2015, the State of Mississippi filed a complaint in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County against substantially the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers as in the suits brought by the California counties and City of Chicago, including J&J and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices and seeking penalties and injunctive and monetary relief. In March 2016, defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint.

In September 2011, Synthes, Inc. (Synthes) received a Civil Investigative Demand issued pursuant to the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

(Acclarent) received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents broadly relating to the sales, marketing and alleged off-label promotion by Acclarent of the RELIEVA STRATUS® MicroFlow Spacer product (the RELIEVA STRATUS® Spacer). In March 2016, Acclarent executed a civil settlement with the United States Justice Department and other agencies to resolve this investigation. Johnson & Johnson was not a party to this settlement and there was no admission of liability. In a separate matter, in July 2016, the former President/CEO and Vice President of Sales of Acclarent (the former Acclarent officers), were convicted of misdemeanor violations in connection with the sale and marketing of the RELIEVA STRATUS® Spacer. There are no charges against Acclarent, Ethicon, Inc. or Johnson & Johnson in this matter.In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators' subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied and they have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, in October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.’s hip products. The States are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR™ XL Hip device investigation for a total payment of $4 million to the State of Oregon.In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes.  The companies have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 45 states and the District of Columbia.In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts® System during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013. OCD and Johnson & Johnson retain certain liabilities that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with the request. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos.In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S® Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by Johnson & Johnson) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. This matter is currently scheduled for trial in February 2017. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products.  The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act.In recent years, Johnson & Johnson has received numerous requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries.

NOTE 12— RESTRUCTURING

The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in today’s evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company is undertaking actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017.  In the fiscal six months of 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $278 million, of which $24 million was included in cost of products sold and $20 million was included in other (income) expense. See table below for additional details. Total restructuring charges of $868 million have been recorded since the restructuring has been announced.Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 4 to 6 percent of the Medical Devices segment’s global workforce over the next two years, subject to any consultation procedures in countries, where required. Approximately 900 positions have been eliminated since the restructuring has been announced.The Company estimates that approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays, includingapproximately $500 million of employee severance. Approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs are non-cash,relating primarily to facility rationalization, inventory write-offs and intangible asset write-offs.The following table summarizes the severance related reserves and the associated spending under this initiative through the first fiscal six months of 2016:

* Percentage greater than 100% **Not meaningfulImmunology products achieved operational sales growth of 19.8% as compared to the same period a year ago due to strong market growth and increased share for both STELARA® (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab). Additionally, in the fiscal second quarter of 2016, total immunology sales growth was positively impacted by approximately 6.0% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates. On a product basis, growth of REMICADE®(infliximab), SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) and STELARA® (ustekinumab) were positively impacted by approximately 5.5%, 7.0%, and 7.0%, respectively. The patents for REMICADE®(infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. The timing of the possible introduction of any biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). In April 2016, the FDA approved a biosimilar version of REMICADE® for sale in the United States. There is a risk that this approved biosimilar version of REMICADE® could be introduced to the U.S. market on or after October 3, 2016 (180 days after the FDA’s approval), even though one or more valid patents are in place and the Company will continue to assert its patent rights. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. The launch of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the U.S. is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows in 2016.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents.Infectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 19.1% as compared to the same period a year ago.  Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT®(rilpivirine) and PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/ REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat). Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 2.8% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/ INVEGA TRINZA®(paliperidone palmitate).  Neuroscience products sales were negatively impacted by lower sales of INVEGA® (paliperidone) due to generic competition and RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone).Oncology products achieved strong operational sales growth of 29.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) and DARZALEX® (daratumumab) due to increased patient uptake and the launch of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) in Europe.  Sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) grew in the U.S. and Asia primarily due to market growth and the launch in China. Additionally, sales growth of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) was positively impacted by approximately 3.5% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates.Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products achieved operational sales growth of 4.7% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to strong sales of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) and INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin). The sales growth of Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other was negatively impacted by approximately 2.0% due to a higher adjustment to previous reserve estimates in 2015. A positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates in the fiscal second quarter of 2015 was primarily related to hormonal contraceptives while a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates in the fiscal second quarter of 2016 was primarily related to PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (Epoetin alfa).

*Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year product disclosure.** Percentage greater than 100% ***Not meaningfulThe Orthopaedics franchise achieved operational sales growth of 2.0% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter. Sales growth was primarily driven by worldwide sales of the hip primary stem platform, U.S. sales of the trauma TFNA nailing system, the ATTUNE® Knee System, and sports medicine ORTHOVISC®/MONOVISC® products. Growth was negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in customer inventory levels primarily in China and continued pricing pressures.The Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 4.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, Inc. also contributed to growth this quarter. Operational growth in General Surgery was driven by sutures partially offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products.  Growth of Mentor products was offset by lower sales of Advanced Sterilization Products in Specialty Surgery.The Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 5.8% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter due to sales growth across all the major regions driven by new product launches and line extensions. Growth was partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program. The Cardiovascular Care franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 13.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter.  Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business driven by market growth and new product launches was offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. The Cordis business generated annual net revenues of approximately $535 million in 2015. The Diabetes Care franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 3.5% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter primarily due to price decline of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) products and competition in the U.S., partially offset by the success of the ANIMAS® VIBE® in Europe and Canada and SMBG products in emerging markets.

ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME

Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income for the first fiscal six months of 2016 was $10.2 billion as compared to $11.3 billion in the first fiscal six months of 2015, a decrease of 9.9%.  The decrease was primarily due to  litigation expense of $0.7 billion included in the fiscal six months of 2016 versus the fiscal six months of 2015, which included a net litigation gain of $0.3 billion primarily related to a settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant.  Additionally, the fiscal six months of 2016 had lower gains of $0.8 billion on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to the fiscal six months of 2015 and included a restructuring charge of $0.3 billion. The fiscal six months of 2016 included the divestiture of the controlled substance raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business. The fiscal six months of 2015 included the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®.  This was partially offset by higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs as compared to the fiscal six months of 2015.Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income for the fiscal second quarter of 2016 was $4.9 billion as compared to $5.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 14.6%.  The decrease was primarily due to lower gains of $0.8 billion on the sale of assets/businesses and higher litigation expense of $0.5 billion recorded in 2016, as compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2015.  The fiscal second quarter of 2016 included the divestiture of the controlled substance raw material and API business. The fiscal second quarter of 2015 included the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®.  Additionally, the fiscal second quarter of 2016 included a restructuring charge of $0.1 billion. This was partially offset by higher sales volume, favorable mix and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs as compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2015.Cost of Products Sold Consolidated costs of products sold for the first fiscal six months of 2016 decreased to 29.6% from 30.2% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated costs of products sold for the fiscal second quarter of 2016 decreased to 28.9% from 30.1% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to favorable mix in the business and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency.  The intangible asset amortization expense for the fiscal six months of 2016 and 2015 was $576 million and $619 million, respectively. Selling, Marketing and Administrative ExpensesConsolidated selling, marketing and administrative expenses for the first fiscal six months of 2016 decreased to 27.4% from 29.1% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated selling, marketing and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter of 2016 decreased to 28.0% from 30.3% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to cost management and favorable mix, primarily due to faster growth in the Pharmaceutical segment.Research and Development ExpenseWorldwide costs of research and development activities for the first fiscal six months of 2016 increased to 11.9% from 11.5% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. Worldwide costs of research and development activities for the fiscal second quarter of 2016 increased to 12.2% from 12.0% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased investment spending in the Pharmaceutical segment to advance the pipeline.In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)During the first fiscal six months of 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell.Interest (Income) ExpenseInterest income in the fiscal six months and fiscal second quarter of 2016 was higher than the same periods a year ago due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates.  The ending balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $42.6 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2016, which is an increase of $8.6 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.Interest expense in the fiscal six months and fiscal second quarter of 2016 was higher as compared to the same periods a year ago.  At the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company’s debt position was $26.2 billion as compared to $19.3 billion the same period a year ago. The higher debt balance of approximately $6.9 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016.  The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc., gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.

(1) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer SegmentThe Consumer segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the first fiscal six months of 2016 was 17.2% versus 14.0% for the same period a year ago. The Consumer segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal second quarter of 2016 was 16.7% versus 9.1% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales for both periods was primarily due to favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins due to cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This was partially offset by operations in Venezuela. Pharmaceutical SegmentThe Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the first fiscal six months of 2016 was 41.8% versus 45.2% for the same period a year ago. The Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal second quarter of 2016 was 42.6% versus 51.9% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales for both periods was primarily due to higher divestiture gains of $0.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2016. The second quarter and first fiscal six months of 2016 included the divestiture of the controlled substance raw material and API business. The second quarter and first fiscal six months of 2015 included the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®.  This was partially offset by strong sales volume growth, a higher positive adjustment of $0.1 billion to previous reserve estimates as compared to the prior year and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Additionally, the fiscal six months of 2016, had a lower net litigation expense of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year. Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the first fiscal six months of 2016 was 20.1% versus 30.2% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales for the fiscal six months was primarily due to litigation expense of $0.7 billion in the fiscal six months of 2016 as compared to the fiscal six months of 2015, which included a net litigation gain of $0.4 billion primarily related to a litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant.  Additionally, the fiscal six months of 2016 included a restructuring charge of $0.3 billion and was impacted by unfavorable transactional currency.  This was partially offset by lower costs of $0.1 billion associated with the DePuy ASR™ Hip program as compared to the fiscal six months of 2015. The Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal second quarter of 2016 was 14.7% versus 24.9% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales for the fiscal second quarter was primarily due to higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2016 as compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2015.  Additionally, the fiscal second quarter of 2016 included a restructuring charge of $0.1 billion and was impacted by unfavorable transactional currency.RestructuringThe Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018, including approximately $200 million savings in 2016. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $141 million, of which $7 million is included in cost of products sold and $20 million is included in other (income) expense. In the first fiscal six months of 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $278 million, of which $24 million was included in cost of products sold and $20 million was included in other (income) expense. Restructuring charges of $868 million have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.  See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.Provision for Taxes on IncomeThe worldwide effective income tax rates for the first fiscal six months of 2016 and 2015 were 17.1% and 21.9%, respectively. In the first fiscal six months of 2016, the Company had higher income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions as compared to 2015, which decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 1.7%.  The Company adopted the new accounting standard for the reporting of tax benefits on share-based compensation. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the adoption of this new standard reduced the tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2016, by approximately 2.8% versus 2015. The remainder of the change from prior year was primarily related to the U.S. Research & Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through provisions, which were not enacted into law until the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, and the settlement of certain open tax positions in several international jurisdictions.As of July 3, 2016, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. The Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 for more detailed information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $18.6 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2016 as compared with $13.7 billion at the fiscal year end of 2015. The primary sources of cash were approximately $6.8 billion net cash generated from operating activities offset by $0.2 billion used by investing activities and $1.6 billion used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $23.9 billion in marketable securities at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2016 and $24.6 billion at the end of 2015.Cash flow from operations of $6.8 billion was the result of $8.5 billion of net earnings, $2.5 billion of non-cash charges and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset write-downs, and $0.1 billion related to deferred taxes. Cash flow from operations was reduced by $1.0 billion related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily due to the timing of payments and receipts for tax and legal liabilities, $1.5 billion related to accounts receivable and inventories, $1.5 billion of other assets and liabilities and $0.2 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses.Investing activities use of $0.2 billion of cash was primarily used for additions to property, plant and equipment of $1.4 billion and $0.7 billion for acquisitions. Investing activities also included a source of $1.2 billion from the net sales of investments in marketable securities and proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses of $0.7 billion. Financing activities use of $1.6 billion of cash was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion for the repurchase of common stock. Financing activities also included a source of $6.5 billion from the net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $0.9 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2015, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company under the facility, which expires September 15, 2016, approximates $10.0 billion. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.In the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs. However, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal first quarter and fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company issued bonds for a total of $7.5 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, for general corporate purposes. On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of July 3, 2016, $4.3 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be delayed or suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets.DividendsOn April 28, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.80 per share, payable on June 7, 2016 to shareholders of record as of May 24, 2016. On July 18, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.80 per share, payable on September 6, 2016 to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2016. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.Concentration of Credit RiskGlobal concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.4 billion as of July 3, 2016 and $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016.  Approximately $0.9 billion as of July 3, 2016 and approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers, which are in line with historical collection patterns.The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers was approximately $0.5 billion at July 3, 2016 and January 3, 2016.  The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and in some cases late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions, as necessary.

OTHER INFORMATION

New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. As described above, while the Company continues to do business in Greece, the Company closely monitors the economic situation. As of July 3, 2016, the business of the Company’s Greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the Company's consolidated assets and fiscal six months revenues, respectively.On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit.”  Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have.  Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of July 3, 2016, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal six months revenues. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

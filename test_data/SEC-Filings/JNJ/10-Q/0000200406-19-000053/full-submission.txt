CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and other benefits; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;
•Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;





•Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;
•Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets including, requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation;
•Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Health Care Market Trends
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•Market conditions and the possibility that the Company’s share repurchase program may be delayed, suspended or discontinued;
•Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.






Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors which, could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products.
Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 — The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.

Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.

New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2016-02: LeasesThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019, on a prospective basis. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for arrangements that are classified as operating leases.  The Company’s operating leases resulted in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, however it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.  ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.  These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.  The Company primarily has operating leases for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment, and data processing equipment.   Leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 37 years, some of which could include options to extend the leases when they are reasonably certain.

As noted in the Company’s 2018 10-K, the approximate minimum rental payments required under operating leases that had initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 30, 2018 were:

ASU 2018-02: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThis update allows a Company to elect to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company has elected not to reclassify the income tax effects of this standard and therefore this standard will not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.ASU 2018-16: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic ASC 815)This update adds the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an eligible benchmark interest rate permitted in the application of hedge accounting. The guidance was effective for the Company as of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, due to the previous adoption of ASU 2017-12. The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard may have an impact in the future as the market for SOFR derivatives develops over time and if SOFR is used to hedge the Company’s financial instruments.

ASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements

Table of Contents

This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2018-18 should be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit LossesThis update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 3 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The latest annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. Future impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner, if warranted.

additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. A partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion was previously recorded in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 related to the development program of AL-8176. In the fiscal second quarter of 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. and recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of $2.9 billion.


Goodwill as of June 30, 2019 was allocated by segment of business as follows:

The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets included in cost of products sold was $1.1 billion for each of the fiscal second quarters ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets included in cost of products sold was $2.2 billion for each of the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years approximates $4.4 billion, before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.



NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings.Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.  The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.  Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities effective as of the beginning of fiscal second quarter of 2018.The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements.  As of June 30, 2019, the total amount of collateral paid under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $384 million, net.  On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $49.7 billion, $15.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.  As of December 30, 2018, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $41.1 billion, $7.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.






11

Table of Contents

The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of June 30, 2019, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $341 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values.  The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments:
(Dollars in Millions) December 30, 2018     June 30, 2019    Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other AssetsEquity Investments with readily determinable value $511 292 160 963 963           Equity Investments without readily determinable value $681 (23) 19 677 677
(1) Recorded in Other Income/Expense (2) Other includes impact of currency


For equity investments without readily determinable market values, $22 million of the decrease in the fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There was a $1 million decrease in the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.  Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the first fiscal six months of 2019 and 2018 were 18.4% and 20.4%, respectively. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted into law effective January 1, 2018. This law reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions and introduced a tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) and a Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax (BEAT).  During the first fiscal six months of 2018, the Company estimated the impact of these changes based on the best information and guidance available at that time. Subsequent U.S. Treasury guidance on the application of these provisions allowed the Company to better refine these calculations for fiscal year 2018 and when combined with the election to account for GILTI under the deferred method reduced the first fiscal six months of 2019 effective income tax rate by approximately 2.5% versus the first fiscal six months of 2018. This reduction was partially offset by the Company having more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions, including the one-time impact of the ASP divestiture, which was primarily taxed in the U.S., as compared to the same period in 2018.As of June 30, 2019, the Company had approximately $3.3 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. The Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010 through 2012. The Company currently expects substantial completion of this audit within the next twelve months. The outcome from this tax audit may result in adjustments to the Company’s current estimates that may have a material impact on the Company’s current and future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is substantially completed.Swiss Tax ReformOn September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals and subsequently announced the TRAF will become effective on January 1, 2020. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted TRAF. TRAF provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for multinational companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and an additional research and development tax deduction to encourage investment. The cantons are required to implement new local legislation by January 1, 2020 or the new federal law will be directly applied.  The significant cantons in which the Company operates have not yet enacted legislation in response to TRAF. The transitional provisions of TRAF are also expected to allow companies to elect tax basis adjustments to fair value which is used for tax depreciation and amortization purposes resulting in a deduction over the transitional period.  The adjustment in the Company’s asset tax basis will likely require review and approval by the federal and cantonal tax agencies. The Company has not yet applied for the adjustment to the tax basis. As TRAF was not enacted as of June 30, 2019, the Company has not reflected the financial impacts in its fiscal second quarter results.  The Company estimates the impact of revaluing its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of Swiss Federal enactment of TRAF, without consideration of future cantonal tax rate changes or the transitional provisions, to result in an incremental tax expense between $0.3 billion to $0.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2019.  The financial impact of the future cantonal tax rate changes or the transitional provisions cannot currently be reasonably estimated but may result in a material impact to the future results of the Company.

NOTE 8 — EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal second quarters and the first fiscal six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018:
Fiscal Second Quarter Ended Fiscal Six Months Ended(Shares in Millions) June 30, 2019 July 1, 2018 June 30, 2019 July 1, 2018Basic net earnings per share  $2.11 1.47 3.52 3.10Average shares outstanding — basic 2,652.5 2,682.3 2,656.7 2,682.2Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 140.8 127.5 138.6 141.8Less: shares which could be repurchased under treasury stock method (102.3) (89.3) (99.0) (96.3)Convertible debt shares 0.7 0.8 0.7 0.8Average shares outstanding — diluted 2,691.7 2,721.3 2,697.0 2,728.5Diluted net earnings per share $2.08 1.45 3.47 3.05

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for both the fiscal second quarters ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense.  The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal second quarter ended July 1, 2018 excluded 17 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value.

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense.  The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal six months ended July 1, 2018 included all shares related to stock options, as there were no options or other instruments which were anti-dilutive.

NOTE 10— BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion, marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above, subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $1.1 billion. A probability of success factor ranging from 55% to 95% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 10%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $2.8 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables.  The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $2.0 billion.On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR.CI:LABO) a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2019, through a series of transactions that included an all-cash tender offer to acquire the publicly held shares not already held by the Company for ¥5,900 per share. The Company previously held a 20% ownership in Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd. As of June 2019, the Company became the legal owner of Ci:z Holdings with the completion of the tender offer procedure in Japan. The acquired company was then delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer segment. On June 30, 2019, the fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.5 billion subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.1 billion to the intangible assets with the offset to goodwill. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years. The goodwill

is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.During the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses.  This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. Certain manufacturing sites were transferred to Jabil in the first fiscal six months of 2019 and additional sites are expected to transfer in the remainder of 2019.  As of June 30, 2019, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.2 billion of inventory. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.During the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company completed the acquisition BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. (BeneVir), a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic immunotherapies.



Additionally, during the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company completed the divestitures of NIZORAL®, PANCREASE® and VALCHLOR® products.


NOTE 11 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2019, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.




PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL®; XARELTO®; body powders containing talc,

primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder; INVOKANA®; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of June 30, 2019, in the United States there were approximately 1,500 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 10,500 with respect to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; 24,800 with respect to pelvic meshes; 13,400 with respect to RISPERDAL®; 31,700 with respect to XARELTO®; 15,500 with respect to body powders containing talc; 1,000 with respect to INVOKANA®;  and 2,900 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh.In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Québec Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The British Columbia order is currently the subject of an appeal.  The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR™ Hip-related product liability litigation.Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery.  Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States.  Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial.  During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices.  In Australia, a trial of class action issues has been completed and the parties are awaiting a decision.  The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products.Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device.  Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey.  Along with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® lawsuits, there were a number of filings related to the PROCEED® Mesh and PROCEED® Ventral Patch products.  In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating all PROCEED® and PROCEED® Ventral Patch cases as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.  Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the

The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO® related product liability litigation.Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder.  The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, as well as outside the United States. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the multi-district litigation, the parties have moved to exclude experts, known as Daubert motions.  The Court began conducting Daubert hearings in mid-July 2019.  The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion.  The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs only in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, “Imerys”) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ("Imerys Bankruptcy").  The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to potential liability on account of Imerys’s sales of talc, including to the Company for the Company’s body powders.  In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleged it had against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds.  Based on such claims as well as indemnity and insurance claims the Company has against Imerys, the Company has petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Delaware to establish federal jurisdiction of the state court talc lawsuits under the “related to” jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Company's petition was denied and the state court talc lawsuits that have been removed to federal court on such basis will be remanded. In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages.  In October 2018, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches.  Plaintiff is seeking damages and an order for the Company to reform its internal policies and procedures.  In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief.  A lawsuit is pending in the United

States District Court for the Central District of California alleging violations of Proposition 65, California’s Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law. In June 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary dismissal of this Proposition 65 action and the Company opposed such motion to the extent it would allow plaintiffs’ counsel to refile such claims with new plaintiffs.  In addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy.  The Company is cooperating with these government inquiries and continues to produce documents in response.      Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA®, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes.

Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below.

Medical Devices
In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE® ADVANCE and ACUVUE OASYS® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandt’s United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the district court denied. In April 2016, the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI.  Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).  In February 2019, the CAFC affirmed the judgment in favor of JJVCI. In May 2019, the district court awarded costs in favor of JJVCI.In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents.  Medinol is seeking damages and attorneys’ fees. Although Johnson & Johnson has since sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After the trial in January 2014, the district court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases.  In April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In March 2019, the district court denied Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In April 2019, Medinol filed a notice of appeal.In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE® Knee System.

seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  A claim construction hearing was held in October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to non-infringement of the ’132, ’730 and ’280 patents, based on the district court’s claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction, leaving only the ’426 patent at issue before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding on the ’426 patent (see below).  In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the ’426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of those claims.  A hearing was held in March 2019, and in April 2019, the USPTO issued its decision upholding the validity of the patent. In May 2019, DePuy filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the claims of the ’426 patent.In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017, Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310 (the ’310 patent); 9,084,608; 9,241,759 (the ’759 patent) and 9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in October 2017.  The parties have entered joint stipulations such that only the ’310 patent and the ’759 patent remain in dispute. The trial is scheduled to begin in September 2019.In December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that Acclarent’s RELIEVA® Spin and RELIEVEA SpinPlus® products infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,011,412 (the ’412 patent).  Dr. Albritton also alleges breach of contract, fraud and that he is the true owner of Acclarent’s U.S. Patent No. 8,414,473.   In December 2016, Acclarent filed a petition for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) challenging the validity of the ’412 patent. The USPTO instituted the IPR in July 2017.   In July 2018, the USPTO ruled in favor of Albritton in the IPR, finding that Acclarent had not met its burden of proof that the challenged claims were invalid.  Acclarent appealed the IPR decision in September 2018.  A second IPR petition was not instituted.  The trial is scheduled for October 2019.  In June 2019, Albritton filed a motion for summary judgment that the asserted patent is not invalid.  In June 2019, Acclarent filed a motion for summary judgment that the asserted claims are not infringed and that Albritton’s non-patent claims are barred by, among other things, the statute of limitations.In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and Tissuegen, Inc. (collectively, UT) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against Ethicon, Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging the manufacture and sale of VICRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, MONOCRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, PDS® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, STRATAFIX® POS® Antibacterial Sutures and STRATAFIX® MONOCRYL®Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs’ United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 (the ’603 patent) directed to implantable polymer drug releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent.  UT is seeking damages and an injunction.  In December 2018, Ethicon filed petitions with the USPTO, seeking Inter Partes Review (IPR) of both asserted patents. Those petitions have been stayed by the USPTO pending a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in an unrelated case.  In June 2019, the stay on the IPRs was lifted, and a decision on institution is due in November 2019.  UT dismissed the ’603 patent from the suit.




Pharmaceutical
In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company (Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the court entered a decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the court’s decision and the injunction is stayed pending the appeal.  In January 2018, the court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the CJEU’s ruling on the issue. In April 2018, Acerta Pharma B.V., AstraZeneca UK Ltd and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Pharmacyclics LLC and Abbvie Inc. (collectively, Abbvie), alleging that the manufacture and sale of IMBRUVICA® infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,459,554.  Janssen

Biotech, Inc., which commercializes IMBRUVICA® jointly with Abbvie, intervened in the action in November 2018. A trial is scheduled to begin in January 2021.REMICADE® Related CasesIn August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrion’s biosimilar.  In August 2016, the district court granted both Celltrion’s and Hospira’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the ’471 patent.In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. In July 2018 the district court granted Celltrion’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the ’083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions.The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched.Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.





ZYTIGA®
In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.

Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. A case brought by Illinois was tried in May 2019 and post-trial briefing is underway. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation.

Opioids Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 2,000 lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®, NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER.  The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016).  To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed in state court by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota.

These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioids marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. The case filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General started trial in May 2019.  Additionally, over 2,000 federal cases have been coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804).  The first trial date in the MDL has been set for October 2019.  An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.  Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation.

In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case.  The California case started trial in July 2019.

Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 43 states and the District of Columbia. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts® and Cellex® Systems during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with those requests.

The federal and state governments declined to intervene in the second suit, and the relator moved to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. In April 2019, the court granted the relator's motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE® or SIMPONI ARIA®.In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX®, OLYSIO®, REMICADE®, SIMPONI®, STELARA® and ZYTIGA®. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies. In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc. spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy Synthes, Inc. have produced documents in response to the subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation.In July 2018 the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry.  The United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have made additional preliminary inquiries about the inspection in Brazil, and Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. is cooperating with those requests.From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.

GENERAL LITIGATION
In May 2014, two purported class actions were filed in federal court, one in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and one in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI) alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged health risks associated with talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S® Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI). Both cases seek injunctive relief and monetary damages; neither includes a claim for personal injuries. In October 2016, both cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the District Court of New Jersey as part of a newly created federal multi-district litigation. In July 2017, the district court granted Johnson & Johnson's and JJCI’s motion to dismiss one of the cases.  In September 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed this dismissal.   In September 2017, the plaintiff in the second case voluntarily dismissed the complaint.  In March 2018, the plaintiff in the second case refiled in Illinois State Court.In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho), assessing penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in PREZISTA®) in connection with its importation into the United States. In October 2014, Janssen Ortho submitted a Petition for Relief in response to the Penalty Notice. In May 2015, US CBP issued an Amended Penalty Notice assessing substantial penalties and Janssen Ortho filed a Petition for Relief in July 2015. In May 2019, US CBP issued its Mitigation Decision and determined that Janssen Ortho had negligently misrepresented that darunavir ethanolate is entitled to duty free treatment.  In June 2019, Janssen Ortho filed a Supplemental Petition for Relief. The Penalties Proceeding will be impacted by the related Classification Litigation pending in the United States Court of International Trade. The Classification Litigation will determine whether darunavir ethanolate was properly classified as exempt from duties upon importation into the United States. The trial in the Classification Litigation commenced in July 2019. In March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in November 2015. In December 2018, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Defendants filed two motions for interlocutory appeal of class certification to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Both motions were denied. Defendants' motions for summary judgment are pending in the District Court. In August 2015, two third-party payors filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Janssen Ortho LLC, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (as well as certain Bayer entities), alleging that the defendants improperly marketed and promoted XARELTO® as safer and more effective than less expensive alternative medications while failing to fully disclose its risks.  The complaint seeks damages.In May 2017, Lonza Sales AG (Lonza) filed a Request for Arbitration with the London Court of International Arbitration against Janssen Research & Development, LLC (Janssen R&D). Lonza alleges that Janssen R&D breached a 2005 agreement between the parties by sublicensing certain Lonza technology used in the manufacture of daratumumab without Lonza’s consent. Lonza seeks monetary damages.  In May 2019, the arbitration award was issued and the matter has been resolved.In September 2017, Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Pfizer alleges that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE®.  The complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief. Discovery is ongoing. Beginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions of direct and indirect purchasers were filed against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen’s REMICADE® contracting strategies violated federal and state antitrust and consumer laws and seeking damages and injunctive relief.  In November 2017, the cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Remicade Antitrust Litigation. A motion to compel arbitration of the direct purchaser case was denied and is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  Motions to dismiss were denied in both the direct and indirect purchaser cases.

In June 2018, Walgreen Co. and Kroger Co, filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The complaint alleges that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE®.  The complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief. In March 2019, summary judgment was granted in favor of Janssen.  This ruling is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.In June 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a Civil Investigative Demand to Johnson & Johnson in connection with its investigation of whether Janssen’s  REMICADE® contracting practices violate federal antitrust laws.In October 2017, certain United States service members and their families brought a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the United States Anti-Terrorism Act.  The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In January 2019, plaintiffs' motion to file a Second Amended Complaint adding plaintiffs to the lawsuit was granted. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. In October 2018, two separate putative class actions were filed against Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc., and Actelion Clinical Research, Inc. (collectively “Actelion”) in United States District Court for the District of Maryland and United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The complaints allege that Actelion violated state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to supply generic pharmaceutical manufacturers with samples of TRACLEER®.  TRACLEER® is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which imposes restrictions on distribution of the product.  In January 2019, the plaintiffs dismissed the District of Columbia case and filed a consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.  In February 2019, Actelion filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.In December 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, Janssen) were served with a qui tam complaint filed on behalf of the United States, 28 states, and the District of Columbia.  The complaint, which was filed in December 2017 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Janssen violated the federal False Claims Act and state law when providing pricing information for ZYTIGA® to the government in connection with direct government sales and government-funded drug reimbursement programs.  At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene. The case has been transferred to United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Janssen has moved to dismiss the complaint. In April 2019, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Louisiana and HMO Louisiana, Inc. filed a class action complaint against Janssen Biotech, Inc, Janssen Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC and BTG International Limited in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Sherman Act and the antitrust and consumer protections laws of several states by pursuing patent litigation relating to ZYTIGA®  in order to delay generic entry. The case has been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.

*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentationImmunology products achieved operational growth of 5.7% as compared to the same period a year ago driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, the strong launch of TREMFYA® (guselkumab), expanded indications of SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), and U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products achieved operational growth of 5.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of SYMTUZA® and the launch of JULUCA® were partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA® and PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 3.9% as compared to the same period a year ago. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by strong sales of INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA® and INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® (paliperidone palmitate) and was partially offset by RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone). The decline of U.S. CONCERTA®/methylphenidate sales was due to generic competition.Oncology products achieved strong operational sales growth of 14.1% as compared to the same period a year ago. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) and IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally. DARZALEX® sales included one-time adjustments related to the completion of pricing and reimbursement discussions in certain European countries which positively impacted worldwide DARZALEX® growth by approximately 16%. Growth was negatively impacted from a decline in U.S. sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by generic competition partially offset by increased sales outside the U.S. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 6.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth and increased share while sales of TRACLEER® (bosetan) were negatively impacted by increased use of OPSUMIT® and generics. Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 14.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Lower sales of XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) were driven by higher discounts and rebates, lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) were due to competitive pressure and a safety label update and lower sales of PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition.

Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutters and growth outside the U.S. in energy products driven by share gains and new products. Growth was partially offset by a sales decline in biosurgery due to an isolated supply disruption.  The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by mechanical products due to a temporary stapler recall partially offset by growth of wound closure products.

Operational growth was primarily driven by strength of daily disposables and Astigmatism lenses in the OASYS® contact lenses category. The Surgical operational decline was primarily driven by competitive pressures in the U.S. partially offset by strength of cataracts outside the U.S.  The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved strong operational sales growth of 15.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter.  Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure volume. Growth in the Cerenovus business was driven by new product innovation and market growth.

ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME

Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income for the first fiscal six months of 2019 was $11.5 billion representing 28.2% of sales as compared to $10.5 billion in the first fiscal six months of 2018, representing 25.6% of sales. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income for the fiscal second quarter of 2019 was $7.0 billion representing 34.2% of sales as compared to $5.0 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2018, representing 23.9% of sales. Cost of Products Sold Consolidated costs of products sold for the first fiscal six months of 2019 increased to 33.4% from 33.2% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated costs of products sold for the fiscal second quarter of 2019 increased to 33.8% from 33.3% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase in both periods was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix and the negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceutical business.  The intangible asset amortization expense for each of the fiscal second quarters of 2019 and 2018 was $1.1 billion. The intangible asset amortization expense for each of the first fiscal six months of 2019 and 2018 was $2.2 billion. Selling, Marketing and Administrative ExpensesConsolidated selling, marketing and administrative expenses for the first fiscal six months of 2019 decreased to 26.5% from 27.0% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated selling, marketing and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter of 2019 decreased to 27.0% from 27.5% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to favorable segment mix and lower costs relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business. Additionally, planned optimization in the Consumer business and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business was partially offset by increased investment spending in the Medical Device business in the fiscal second quarter of 2019.Research and Development ExpenseWorldwide costs of research and development activities for the first fiscal six months of 2019 increased to 13.6% from 12.3% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in the fiscal six months was due to higher upfront payments, primarily related to argenx and increased investment to advance the pipeline. Worldwide costs of research and development activities for the fiscal second quarter of 2019 increased to 13.0% from 12.7% of sales as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in the fiscal second quarter was due to increased investment in the Medical Device business related to robotics and digital programs. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)In the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. There was no IPR&D charge in the fiscal six months of 2018. A partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion was previously recorded in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 related to the development program of AL-8176. Interest (Income) ExpenseInterest (Income) Expense in the first fiscal six months and fiscal second quarter of 2019 was net interest income as compared to an expense in the same periods a year ago. This was primarily due to the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps, a higher average interest rate partially offset by a lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance and a lower average debt balance. The balance of cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities was $15.3 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2019 as compared to $18.1 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2018. The Company’s debt position was $29.4 billion as of June 30, 2019 as compared to $32.1 billion the same period a year ago. Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net for the first fiscal six months and fiscal second quarter of 2019 was favorable by $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as compared to the same period a year ago. This was primarily attributable to a gain of $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. In addition the fiscal six months of 2019 included an equity step-up gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in Ci:z Holdings (Dr. Ci: Labo) and higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.3 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion in the fiscal six months of 2019 as compared to $0.7 billion in the fiscal six months of 2018. The fiscal six months of 2018 included divestiture gains of $0.4 billion, primarily NIZORAL®. The fiscal second quarter of 2019 included lower litigation expense of $0.4 billion as compared to $0.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2018 and higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.1 billion as compared to the same period a year ago.  The fiscal second quarter of 2018 included divestiture gains of $0.4 billion, primarily NIZORAL®.

Consumer SegmentThe Consumer segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the first fiscal six months of 2019 was 16.7% versus 20.0% for the same period a year ago. The first fiscal six months of 2019 included litigation expense of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the prior year offset by a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in Ci:z Holdings (Dr Ci: Labo) and leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The first fiscal six months of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the divestiture of NIZORAL®. The Consumer segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal second quarter of 2019 was 11.5% versus 23.7% for the same period a year ago. The fiscal second quarter of 2019 included litigation expense of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense as compared to the prior year. In addition, the fiscal second quarter of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the divestiture of NIZORAL®.Pharmaceutical SegmentThe Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the first fiscal six months of 2019 was 28.9% versus 36.2% for the same period a year ago. The Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal second quarter of 2019 was 34.9% versus 35.3% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the first fiscal six months of 2019 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion, higher litigation expense of $0.3 billion, higher cost of products sold due to the negative impact of currency and increased spending in research and development primarily due to a $0.3 billion upfront payment to argenx. This was partially offset by $0.3 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities, lower Actelion acquisition related costs and leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative as compared to the prior year. In addition, the first fiscal six months of 2018 included a higher gain of $0.1 billion related to divestitures. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and the negative impact of currency recorded in cost of products sold. In addition, the fiscal second quarter of 2018 included a higher gain of $0.1 billion related to divestitures. This was partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities and leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative as compared to the prior year.Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the first fiscal six months of 2019 was 36.2% versus 17.3% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the first fiscal six months was primarily attributable to a gain of $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business, lower litigation expense of $0.4 billion, lower restructuring charges of $0.1 billion and lower intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion. This was partially offset by increased investment spending. The Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal second quarter of 2019 was 49.1% versus 11.4% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal second quarter was primarily attributable to a gain of $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business, lower litigation expense of $0.5 billion and lower restructuring charges of $0.1 billion. This was partially offset by increased investment spending.

Restructuring

In the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. In the fiscal second quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $142 million, of which $38 million is included in cost of products sold and $47 million is included in other (income) expense. Restructuring charges of $0.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.  See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.


Provision for Taxes on Income

For discussion on the provision for taxes refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Swiss Tax Reform On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals and subsequently announced the TRAF will become effective on January 1, 2020.   In the third fiscal quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted TRAF. TRAF provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for multinational companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and an additional research and development tax deduction to encourage investment. The cantons are required to implement new local legislation by January 1, 2020 or the new federal law will be directly applied.  The significant cantons in which the Company operates have not yet enacted legislation in response to TRAF. The transitional provisions of TRAF are also expected to allow companies to elect tax basis adjustments to fair value which is used for tax depreciation and amortization purposes resulting in a deduction over the transitional period.  The adjustment in the Company’s asset tax basis will likely require review and approval by the federal and cantonal tax agencies. The Company has not yet applied for the adjustment to the tax basis. As TRAF was not enacted as of June 30, 2019, the Company has not reflected the financial impacts in its fiscal second quarter results. The Company estimates the impact of revaluing its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of Swiss Federal enactment of TRAF, without consideration of future cantonal tax rate changes or the transitional provisions, to result in an incremental tax expense between $0.3 billion to $0.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. This amount does not include the impact of cantonal law changes expected to be enacted later in fiscal 2019.  It also does not include the tax benefit derived from the transitional provisions previously described. Due to the uncertainty of the cantonal legislation and the approval of the transitional provisions, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the combined financial impact of both the federal and cantonal component of Swiss Tax Reform for the remainder of 2019 or the impact to the consolidated effective tax rate beginning in 2020. The Company is continually assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform.  When all aspects are fully enacted, the federal and the cantonal tax law changes may have a material impact on the future results of operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $14.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2019 as compared with $18.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.7 billion decrease were approximately $9.5 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $3.2 billion net cash used by investing activities and $10.1 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $0.9 billion in marketable securities at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2019 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2018.Cash flow from operations of $9.5 billion was the result of $9.4 billion of net earnings and $5.0 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset write-downs (primarily related to the Alios IPR&D asset). This was reduced by $2.1 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in inventories, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, an increase in other current and non-current assets, a decrease in other liabilities and net gain on sale of assets/businesses of $2.1 billion (primarily related to the ASP divestiture) and $0.7 billion for the deferred tax provision.Investing activities use of $3.2 billion of cash was primarily used for acquisitions of $5.3 billion and additions to property, plant and equipment of $1.5 billion. Investing activities also included a source of $3.0 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, primarily ASP, and $0.6 billion from the net sales of investments.Financing activities use of $10.1 billion of cash was primarily used for dividends to shareholders of $4.9 billion, the repurchase of common stock of $4.7 billion and the net retirement of short and long term debt of $1.0 billion. Financing activities also included a source of $0.5 billion from proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards.In the fiscal second quarter of 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its ASP business and received $2.7 billion of cash proceeds. Additionally, the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company under the facility, which expires on September 12, 2019, approximates $10.0 billion. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. Through June 30, 2019, $3.8 billion has been repurchased under the program.In the fiscal second quarter of 2019, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of June 30, 2019, the net debt position was $14.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $14.0 billion. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.DividendsOn April 25, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.95 per share, payable on June 11, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 28, 2019. On July 15, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.95 per share, payable on September 10, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 27, 2019. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.

OTHER INFORMATION

New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela and Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U.  Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of June 30, 2019, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal six months revenue, respectively.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. For discussion on Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform) see Provision for Taxes on Income in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA, initiated Inter Partes Review proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in these actions, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.

Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation.

These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and other benefits; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;
•Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;



•Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;
•Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets including, requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation;
•Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•The risks associated with global operations, including the impact of global public health crises and pandemics, such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates.
•Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations;
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets; and




Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors which, could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain, including the Company's transaction with Jabil Inc., may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products.
Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 — The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.

Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.

Use of Estimates
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of March 29, 2020 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 29, 2020, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

New Accounting Standards
The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements and below describes the impacts from newly adopted standards, as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2018-18: Collaborative ArrangementsThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit LossesThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

NOTE 3 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The latest annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Future impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner, if warranted.

The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets included in cost of products sold was $1.1 billion for each of the fiscal first quarters ended March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.

The estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately:

NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings.Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.  The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.  Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of March 29, 2020, the total amount of cash collateral held by the Company under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $2.0 billion, net. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of March 29, 2020, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $44.0 billion, and $20.1 billion respectively.  As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $45.3 billion and $20.1 billion respectively.All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of March 29, 2020, the balance of deferred net gain on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $675 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of

time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values.  The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments:
(Dollars in Millions) December 29, 2019     March 29, 2020    Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other AssetsEquity Investments with readily determinable value $1,148 (327) 5 826 826           Equity Investments without readily determinable value $712 (33) 15 694 694
(1) Recorded in Other Income/Expense (2) Other includes impact of currency

For equity investments without readily determinable market values, $33 million of the decrease in the fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments.  Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal first quarters of 2020 and 2019 were 11.0% and 15.2%, respectively. In the third fiscal quarter of 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), which became effective on January 1, 2020.  More information on the provisions of TRAF can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. During the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation and, accordingly, the Company recorded an estimated deferred tax benefit of approximately $0.3 billion for the remeasurement of existing deferred tax liabilities offset by a related $0.2 billion increase in U.S. GILTI deferred taxes  (or 1.3% net impact on the Q1 2020 effective tax rate). The Company is currently assessing and awaiting the approval for certain elective transition provisions in several cantons which include discussions with federal and cantonal tax authorities on the application of the new law. The Company has recorded the estimated impact of the transitional provisions based on the best available information for cantons where enactment has occurred, but the Company has not yet received final tax rulings in all cantons. Further, authoritative guidance from the relevant Swiss tax authorities may be issued in the future and additional revisions may be required in the fiscal period they are issued.  In the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company reduced a contingent consideration liability related to the 2019 Auris Health acquisition that benefited the overall effective tax rate by 1.9% (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).  Additionally, the Company had more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, driven primarily by the one-time charges in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 related to the impairment of the Alios in-process research and development intangible asset taxed in the U.S. at 21.0% and additional tax benefits received from stock based compensation that were either exercised or vested during the fiscal first quarter. As of March 29, 2020, the Company had approximately $3.2 billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010 through 2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of March 29, 2020, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.2 billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS audit. During the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company made a payment of approximately $0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury with respect to the 2010-2012 tax audit in anticipation of a final settlement later in the fiscal year 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liability. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 8 — EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal first quarters ended March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019:
Fiscal First Quarter Ended(Shares in Millions) March 29, 2020 March 31, 2019Basic net earnings per share  $2.20 1.41Average shares outstanding — basic 2,633.7 2,660.8Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 126.0 136.7Less: shares which could be repurchased under treasury stock method (89.4) (99.4)Convertible debt shares 0.7 0.7Average shares outstanding — diluted 2,671.0 2,698.8Diluted net earnings per share $2.17 1.39

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for both the fiscal first quarters ended March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense.  The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal first quarter ended March 29, 2020 excluded 10 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2019 included all shares related to stock options, as there were no options or other instruments which were anti-dilutive.

NOTE 10— BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.8 billion. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. Additionally, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with world-class robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily.The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.4 billion, goodwill for $0.2 billion, other assets of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $0.4 billion. On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion, marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above, subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period.  As of March 29, 2020, there were no valuation adjustments to the assets acquired but during the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded Other income of $1.0 billion for the reversal of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines. As of March 29, 2020, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration is $0.2 billion. Further, the Company re-assessed the current value of the Auris IPR&D assets in connection with the modified development timeline and determined the fair value still exceeds the carrying value. On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. At March 29, 2020, the fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.4 billion.  The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.1 billion to intangible assets, accrued liabilities, deferred taxes on income and property, plant and equipment with the offset to goodwill. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.During the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil Inc. to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of certain employees and manufacturing sites. The majority of the transfers were completed in 2019 with a minor amount remaining in 2020. As of March 29, 2020, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.1 billion of inventory and property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 11 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed.  The Company continues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation develops.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of March 29, 2020, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.




PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL®; XARELTO®; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder; INVOKANA®; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of March 29, 2020, in the United States there were approximately 940 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 9,500 with respect to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; 16,500 with respect to pelvic meshes; 10,900 with respect to RISPERDAL®; 24,600 with respect to XARELTO®; 19,400 with respect to body powders containing talc; 300 with respect to INVOKANA®;  and 3,500 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh.In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In

November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Québec Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The British Columbia order is currently the subject of the Company's appeal to broaden the scope of participants. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR™ Hip-related product liability litigation.Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery.  Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States.  Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial.  During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL.  The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices.  In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants.  With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process which will require proof of use and causally related loss.  The class actions in Canada are expected to be discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases, subject to court approval of the discontinuance. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device.  Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey.  In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States.   Along with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® lawsuits, there were a number of filings related to the PROCEED® Mesh and PROCEED® Ventral Patch products.  In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating all PROCEED® and PROCEED® Ventral Patch cases as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.  Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the US.  The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED® Mesh

and PROCEED® Ventral Patch products. In September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized management of 107 PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System cases.  The New Jersey Supreme Court granted plaintiffs application in January 2020 and those will be transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL®, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a recent verdict in October 2019 of $8 billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced in January 2020 to $6.8 million by the trial judge. The Company will appeal the final judgment. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO®, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO®, Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an agreement in principle to the settle the XARELTO® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020.  This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO® related product liability litigation.Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder.  The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, as well as outside the United States. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the multi-district litigation, the parties have moved to exclude experts, known as Daubert motions.  The Court held Daubert hearings in mid-July 2019 and a final round of briefing was submitted to the Court. In April 2020, the Court issued rulings which limit the scope of testimony, including some theories and testing methods, for certain plaintiff expert witnesses and denied the attempt to limit the scope of testimony of certain of the Company’s witnesses.  The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion.  The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The Company has established an accrual primarily for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy).  The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims).  In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds.  Based on such claims as well as indemnity and insurance claims the Company has against Imerys, the Company petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Delaware to establish federal jurisdiction of the state court talc lawsuits under the Bankruptcy Code.  The Company's petition was denied and the state court talc lawsuits that have been removed to federal court on such basis have been remanded.  The Company previously proposed to resolve Imerys' (and the Company’s) obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of litigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, waiving the Company’s indemnification claims against Imerys, and lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the bankruptcy forum with the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys.  In addition, the Company has objected to Imerys’ fourth request to extend the time during which the debtor has the exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan.  In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder,

and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019.  In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss.  In March 2020, Defendants answered the complaint.In October 2018, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In June 2019, the shareholder filed an additional complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument.  The Court has not yet ruled in the books and records action.  In September 2019, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the shareholder derivative lawsuit, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In October 2019, the shareholder filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In January 2020, the shareholder voluntarily dismissed his appeal, with prejudice. Four additional shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in New Jersey making similar allegations against the Company and its current directors and certain officers.  In February 2020, these four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation, and the shareholders have until May 2020 to file a consolidated complaint or identify a previously filed complaint as the operative complaint.In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend.A lawsuit is pending in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act relating to JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder.  In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings.  In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter.  In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint.  In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend.In January 2020, the Abtahi Law Group filed an action under Proposition 65 against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. as well as a number of other alleged talcum powder manufacturers and distributors, including one California company.  In that action, the plaintiff alleges contamination of talcum powder products with unsafe levels of arsenic, hexavalent chromium and lead.  The plaintiff seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief. In addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy.  The Company is cooperating with government inquiries and continues to produce documents in response.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below.

Medical Devices
In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Although Johnson & Johnson has since sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After the trial in January 2014, the district court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases.  In April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In March 2019, the district court denied Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In April 2019, Medinol appealed, and the appellate court will conduct a hearing in June 2020.In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE® Knee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants (collectively, DePuy).  MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,558,426 (’426); 8,273,132 (’132); 8,721,730 (’730)   and 9,492,280 (’280) relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAMTM Contact feature of the ATTUNE® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  A claim construction hearing was held in October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to non-infringement of the ’132, ’730 and ’280 patents, based on the district court’s claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction, leaving only the ’426 patent at issue before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding on the ’426 patent (see below).  In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the ’426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of those claims.  A hearing was held in March 2019, and in April 2019, the USPTO issued its decision upholding the validity of the patent. In May 2019, DePuy filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the claims of the ’426 patent. In November 2019, judgment was entered in favor of DePuy.  In December 2019, MedIdea filed a notice of appeal.In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017, Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310 (the ’310 patent); 9,084,608; 9,241,759 (the ’759 patent) and 9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in October 2017.  The parties have entered joint stipulations such that only the ’310 patent and the ’759 patent remain in dispute. A bench trial concluded in March 2020.

(collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrion’s biosimilar.  In August 2016, the district court granted both Celltrion’s and Hospira’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. JBI seeks monetary damages and other relief.   In October 2017, the district court in the Massachusetts action denied Celltrion and Hospira’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing.   In July 2018, the district court in the Massachusetts action granted Celltrion’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the ’083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Celltrion and Hospira cross-appealed on the standing issue. In November 2019, the United States District Court for the District of Utah administratively closed the case against HyClone.  In March 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched.Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.


Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial.  In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.

Opioid Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 2,900 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®, NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER.  The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more than 370 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,600 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada.  In October 2019, an anti-trust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $572 million, subject to a final order to be issued by the court.  The court issued a final judgment reducing the amount to $465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have appealed the judgment. The Company believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment.  In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio.

In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these lawsuits, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized.  This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties.  The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and individual cases are ongoing.  In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.  In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums.  The Company is cooperating and producing documents in response to the various subpoenas and requests for information.In November 2019, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey.  The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches.  In December 2019, two additional shareholders filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New Jersey. The parties to those two cases are conferring regarding consolidation and a scheduling stipulation.

Item 1A.RISK FACTORS

The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, please refer to Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as follows:

Global health crises and pandemics, such as the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), could cause disruptions in our business.

The recent global outbreak of COVID-19 could cause disruptions to the Company's business and have a negative impact on the Company's revenues and operating results. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across its global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent its business from being adversely affected. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and any prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. In particular, the continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, its manufacturing operations, supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, operating results or financial condition.

*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation(1) Previously included in Other Oncology(2) Inclusive of TRACLEER® which was previously disclosed separatelyImmunology products achieved operational growth of 13.1% as compared to the same period a year ago driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and increased COVID-19 related demand, strength in TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis, expanded indications of SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), and U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products achieved operational growth of 11.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of SYMTUZA®, JULUCA® and increased COVID-19 related demand were partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA® and PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 3.1% as compared to the same period a year ago. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA® from new patient starts and persistence, was partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and generic competition on CONCERTA®/methylphenidate. Oncology products achieved strong operational sales growth of 21.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally and increased COVID-19 related demand and the launch uptake of ERLEADA® (apalutamide). Additionally, strong sales and share growth of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) outside the U.S. was partially offset by a decline in U.S. sales driven by generic competition. Lower sales of VELCADE® (bortezomib) were due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 14.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth, increased share and increased COVID-19 related demand. Sales of TRACLEER® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and cannibalization from OPSUMIT®. Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 13.1% as compared to the same period a year ago. Lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) were due to share loss from competitive pressure and a safety label update in the U.S. and lower sales of PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. Increased market growth and COVID-19 related demand of XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) was offset by higher discounts and rebates.

Q1 2020 versus Q1 2019
Research and Development decreased as a percent to sales driven by:•Higher upfront payments in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, primarily related to the argenx collaboration•Increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital programs
partially offset by:

In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)

There was no IPR&D charge in the fiscal first quarter of 2020. In the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176.

Interest (Income) Expense

Interest (Income) Expense in the fiscal first quarter of 2020 was a net interest income as compared to an expense in the same period a year ago. This was primarily due to the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps. This was partially offset by reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances. The balance of cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities was $18.0 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2020 as compared to $15.3 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2019. The Company’s debt position was $27.6 billion as of March 29, 2020 as compared to $29.4 billion the same period a year ago.

Other (Income) Expense, Net

Q1 2020 versus Q1 2019
Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal first quarter of 2020 was favorable by $0.7 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 10, 2020.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or other applicable market rates as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.In the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.  As of March 29, 2020, the net debt position was $9.6 billion as compared to the prior year of $14.0 billion. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any incremental significant risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation to be potentially paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost.Subsequent to March 29, 2020, the Company paid approximately $1.0 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the normal estimated payment for the fiscal first quarter of 2020 and the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019).DividendsOn January 2, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.95 per share, payable on March 10, 2020 to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2020. On April 14, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on June 9, 2020 to shareholders of record as of May 26, 2020. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.

OTHER INFORMATION

New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.Economic and Market FactorsCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity The Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:•Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities. •Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to ensure adequate and effective distribution. •Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.  •Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees  •Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets as needed.•Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations. The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela and Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally exited the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of March 29, 2020, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal three months revenues, respectively.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. For discussion on Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform) see Provision for Taxes on Income in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA, initiated Inter Partes Review proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in these actions, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.

During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.

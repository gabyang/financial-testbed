Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) designs,
manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and
applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the
Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and
education, enterprise and government customers. Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. These condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the
2012 Form 10-K). The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal year 2013 will include 52 weeks, whereas fiscal year 2012 included 53 weeks. An additional
week was included in the first quarter of 2012 to realign the Companys fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters or months refer to the Companys fiscal years
ended in September and the associated quarters or months of those fiscal years. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company
adopted amended accounting standards that change the presentation of comprehensive income. These standards increase the prominence of other comprehensive income (OCI) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the
statement of changes in shareholders equity and requires the components of OCI to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. The amended accounting standards only impact the
financial statement presentation of OCI and do not change the components that are recognized in net income or OCI; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Companys
employee stock purchase plan and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury
stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the
three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Potentially dilutive securities representing 3.7 million shares of common stock for the three months
ended December 29, 2012, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share because their effect would have been antidilutive. The number of potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
per common share because their effect would have been antidilutive was not significant for the three months ended December 31, 2011. Note 2  Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The following tables show the Companys cash and available-for-sale securities adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category

(a)
 The fair value of Level 1 securities is estimated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


(b)
 The fair value of Level 2 securities is estimated based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
The net unrealized gains as of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012 are related primarily to
long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The net
realized gains or losses recognized by the Company related to such sales were not significant during the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The maturities of the Companys long-term marketable securities
generally range from one to five years. As of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012, gross unrealized losses
related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. As
of December 29, 2012, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company
typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and
extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before
recovery of the investments cost basis. During the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing
assets and liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the
Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases
generally up to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and
losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not
limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The
Companys accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
(AOCI) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net
investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The Companys net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges was not significant as of December 29, 2012. The Company had a
net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of $240 million, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as of September 29, 2012. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of
net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are
recognized. The majority of the Companys hedged transactions as of December 29, 2012 are expected to occur within six months. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are
reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during
the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The Companys unrealized net gains and losses
on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of AOCI, were not significant as of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012, respectively. The ineffective portions of and amounts excluded from the
effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. The gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option
contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not
include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts. The following table shows the notional principal amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts
associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012 (in millions):

The notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that
are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal
and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from
contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of December 29, 2012, the Company posted $78 million of cash collateral and received $222 million of cash
collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as other current assets and accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As of September 29, 2012,
the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $278 million, which it recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not have
any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of December 29, 2012 or September 29, 2012. The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments at gross fair value as
reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012 (in millions):

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,
retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers that are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. There were no customers that accounted
for 10% or more of the Companys trade receivables as of December 29, 2012. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other
10%. The Companys cellular network carriers accounted for 58% and 66% of trade receivables as of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012, respectively. Additionally, the Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Companys vendors accounted for 43%, 17% and 16% of total
non-trade receivables as of December 29, 2012 and three of the Companys vendors accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of September 29, 2012.

Note 4  Income Taxes As of December 29, 2012, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, of which $963
million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 29, 2012, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys
effective tax rate. The Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $444 million and $401 million of gross interest and penalties
accrued as of December 29, 2012 and September 29, 2012, respectively, which are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by
between $120 million and $170 million in the next 12 months. Note 5  Shareholders Equity and Share-based Compensation Preferred Stock The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors
is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. Dividend and Stock Repurchase Program Subject to declaration by the Board
of Directors, the Company plans to pay quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. On October 25, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $2.65 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2012.
The Company paid $2.5 billion in conjunction with this dividend on November 15, 2012. In 2012, the Companys Board
of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Companys common stock beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is authorized through 2015 with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future
employee equity grants and employee stock purchases under the Companys equity plans. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. In August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (ASR) with a financial institution to
purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Companys common stock in 2013. In exchange for an up-front payment of $1.95 billion, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during the ASRs purchase period, which ends later
in 2013. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume weighted average price of the Companys stock during that period.
In the first quarter of 2013, 2,582,782 shares were initially delivered to the Company. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. These shares were retired and accounted for as a reduction to
shareholders equity in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company accounted for the ASR as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as a forward contract indexed to its own
common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The following table shows the

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Companys closing stock price on the last
trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The total intrinsic value of options at the time of exercise was $347 million and $457 million for the
three-months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The Company had approximately
30.6 million shares reserved for future issuance under the Companys stock plans as of December 29, 2012. RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock plans utilizing a factor of two
times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Share-based Compensation Share-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date
of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the
Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest rates. The Company recognizes share-based
compensation cost as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company did not grant any stock options during the three months ended December 29,
2012 and December 31, 2011. The weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $136.84 and $88.72 during the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. In conjunction with certain business combinations, the Company assumed 29,000 stock options with a weighted-average fair value per share
of $407.80 during the three months ended December 29, 2012. The following table shows a summary of the share-based
compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (in millions):

Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.4 years. Employee Benefit Plans Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended December 29, 2012, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Philip W.
Schiller, and Jeffrey E. Williams, and director Arthur D. Levinson had equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). An equity trading plan is
a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Companys
employee and director equity plans. Note 6  Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Indemnification The following table shows changes in the Companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application
software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or
damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.
Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either December 29, 2012 or September 29, 2012. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains
directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components
are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and
significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar
terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the Companys requirements. Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely
affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Long-Term Supply Agreements The Company has entered into long-term
agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. Under certain of these agreements, which expire between 2013 and 2022, the Company has made prepayments for the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired capital
equipment to use in the manufacturing of such components. As of December 29, 2012, the Company had a total of $3.9 billion of inventory component
prepayments outstanding, of which $1.3 billion are classified as other current assets and $2.6 billion are classified as other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had a total of $4.2 billion of inventory component
prepayments outstanding as of September 29, 2012. The Companys outstanding prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $323 million of
inventory component prepayments during the first quarter of 2013. Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company
does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for
retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of December 29, 2012, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable
operating leases were $4.5 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to leases for retail space. The Company utilizes several
outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied
by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a
combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of December 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of $18.9 billion. In addition to the commitments mentioned above, the Company had additional off-balance sheet
obligations of $904 million as of December 29, 2012, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and
development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been
fully adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently
uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements
expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Apple
Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al. On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05
billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. Because the award is subject to entry of final judgment and may be
subject to appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its results of operations. VirnetX, Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al.
On August 11, 2010, VirnetX, Inc. filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed
on four patents relating to network communications technology. On November 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded damages of $368 million. The Company is challenging the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and
has not recorded a loss accrual at this time. Note 7  Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Prior to 2013, the Companys reportable operating segments consisted of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. In
2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment. Segment data for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect establishment of the Greater China segment.
The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment
includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan and those countries included in the Greater China segment. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Americas, Europe, Greater
China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as
those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various
nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. Prior to 2013, the Company did not allocate certain manufacturing costs and variances, including costs related to product
tooling and manufacturing process equipment, to its operating segments and instead included these costs and variances in other corporate expenses. In 2013, the Company began allocating these costs and variances to its operating segments and as a
result reclassified a total of $49 million from corporate expenses to its operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2011. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

Item 2.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or
current fact. Forward-looking statements also can be identified by words such as anticipates, expects, believes, plans, will, would, could, and similar terms.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but
are not limited to, those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 29, 2012 (the 2012 Form 10-K) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years, quarters or months refer to the Companys fiscal
years ended in September and the associated quarters or months of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the Company and Apple as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless
otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Available Information The Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K,

portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Companys products and services include iPhone®, iPad®, Mac®, iPod®, Apple TV®, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and Mac OS X® operating systems, iCloud®,
and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store®, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as
well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, and
various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, and services. The Companys business strategy leverages its
unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. As part of its
strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. As part of the iTunes Store, the Companys App Store and iBookstore allow customers
to discover and download applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through iOS devices, namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The Companys Mac App Store allows customers to easily discover, download and
install Mac applications. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that complement the Companys offerings. The Companys strategy also includes expanding
its distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including the market for
mobile communications and media devices with its iOS devices; personal computers with its Mac computers; portable digital players with iPod; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications with the iTunes Store, App Store,
iBookstore, and Mac App Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that
continual investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. The Companys research and development spending is focused on investing in new
hardware and software products, and in further developing its existing products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod hardware; iOS and OS X operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services. The Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales
force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of
the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of
its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which
service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales
by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a
high level of integration and support services, and product expertise. Products A detailed discussion of the Companys products may be found in Part I, Item 1, Business, of the Companys 2012
Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods
used in the preparation of the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and
impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these
policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Companys
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been
transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers
revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is
essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software
accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the
hardware. For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware
products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling
prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that
deliverable. ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers.
The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is
allocated to these rights and services based on the Companys ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Companys ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. The Companys process for determining ESPs involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are
expected to be provided, or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Companys ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future
sales of these devices could change. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price
protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the
other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the
Companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for
expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue.
Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of
particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Companys results of
operations. Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities The Companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes
in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Companys
net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. The Company
regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the
Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it will more
likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis. The Companys assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes
in assumptions related to any particular security. Inventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated
Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of
product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply
agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or
net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost
trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an
asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to
record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or manufacturing-related capital assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Companys products being less favorable than forecasted,
unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Companys
suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturing process equipment or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period when the
write-downs were recorded. The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have
been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments
typically cover the Companys requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products, if the Companys product development plans change, or if there
is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period
when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed
base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially
affect the Companys results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes tax
benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to
the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP
and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred
and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable
possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against
the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in
excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on
the last Saturday of September. An extra week is added to the Companys first quarter approximately every six years to realign the Companys fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. A 14th week was added to the first quarter of 2012, while the first quarter
of 2013 spanned only 13 weeks. Inclusion of the 14th week
increased the Companys overall net sales and operating expenses for the first quarter of 2012. Despite the lack of a 14th week in the first quarter of 2013, net sales increased $8.2 billion or 18% compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Several factors contributed positively to this increase: 

 

 
 iPhone net sales were $30.7 billion in the first quarter of 2013 representing an increase of $6.7 billion or 28% compared to the first quarter of
2012. iPhone unit sales totaled 47.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, which represents an increase of 10.7 million units or 29% compared to the same period in 2012. iPhone year-over-year growth reflects strong demand for iPhone in all
of the Companys operating segments primarily due to the launch of iPhone 5 beginning in September 2012 and strong ongoing demand for iPhone 4 and 4S. Net sales of iPhone accounted for 56% of the Companys total net sales for the first
quarter of 2013 compared to 52% in the first quarter of 2012. 

 

 
 iPad net sales were $10.7 billion in the first quarter of 2013 representing an increase of $1.9 billion or 22% compared to the first quarter of
2012. Unit sales of iPad were 22.9 million during the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 48% compared to the same period in 2012. The year-over-year increase in net sales and unit sales was driven by strong demand for iPad in all of the
Companys operating segments as a result of the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad with
Retina® display in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year growth rate of iPad unit sales was higher than
the growth rate of iPad net sales during the first quarter of 2013 due to a reduction in average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced iPad models, including iPad mini. Net sales of iPad accounted for 20% of the
Companys total net sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 19% in the first quarter of 2012. 

 

 
 Net sales for iTunes, software and services were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2013 representing an increase of $667 million or 22% compared
to the first quarter of 2012. This increase was due primarily to growth of iTunes which generated total net sales of $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2013. iTunes growth reflects continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices and
expanded iTunes digital content and applications offerings around the world, resulting in higher net sales on the App Store and higher net sales of digital content. Net sales of iTunes, software and services accounted for 7% of the Companys
total net sales for both the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The following factors
contributed to the partial offset of the overall increase in net sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same quarter in 2012: 

 

 
 Mac net sales were $5.5 billion in the first quarter of 2013 representing a decrease of $1.1 billion or 16% compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Mac unit sales decreased by 1.1 million or 22% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Declines in Mac net sales and Mac unit sales were experienced to some extent in all of the Companys operating segments and
reflect overall declines in unit sales of both desktop and portable systems. Mac sales were negatively impacted during the first quarter of 2013 by a number of factors including supply constraints through the end of the quarter on the Companys
new iMac models that were announced in October 2012 but did not ship until the final month of the quarter; one less week in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012; and the overall weakness in the market for personal
computers. Net sales of Mac declined to 10% of the Companys total net sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 14% in the first quarter of 2012. 

 

 
 iPod net sales were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013 representing a decrease of $385 million or 15% compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Unit sales of iPods decreased by 18% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Net sales of iPods accounted for 4% of the Companys total net sales for the first quarter of 2013 compared to 5% in the first quarter of
2012. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Prior to 2013, the Companys reportable operating segments
consisted of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. In 2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment. Segment data for prior periods has been
reclassified to reflect establishment of the Greater China segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan and those countries included in the Greater China segment. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries,
including the U.S. The results of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services.
Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Note 7, Segment Information and Geographic Data in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Americas Net sales in
the Americas segment increased $2.6 billion or 15% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The growth in net sales during the first quarter of 2013 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the
launch of iPhone 5, increased demand for iPad following the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad with Retina display in the first quarter of 2013, and higher sales from iTunes. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net
sales of Mac and iPod. The Americas segment represented 37% and 38% of the Companys total net sales in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Europe Net sales in the Europe segment increased $1.2 billion or 11%
during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The growth in net sales during the first quarter of 2013 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launch of iPhone 5 and increased demand for iPad
following the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad in the first quarter of 2013, and higher sales from iTunes. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod. Net sales in the Europe segment continue to
be negatively impacted by the regions uncertain economic conditions. The Europe segment represented 23% and 24% of the Companys total net sales in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Greater China Net sales
in the Greater China segment increased $2.8 billion or 67% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The growth in net sales during the first quarter of 2013 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following
the launch of iPhone 5 and increased demand for iPad, partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod. The Greater China segment grew to 13% of the Companys total net sales for the first quarter of 2013 compared to 9% during the
first quarter of 2012. Japan Net sales in the Japan segment increased $893 million or 25% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The growth in net sales was mainly due to increased demand for iPhone
following the launch of iPhone 5 and higher sales from iTunes. The Japan segment represented 8% of the Companys total net sales in both the first quarter of 2013 and 2012. Rest of Asia Pacific Net sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment
increased $376 million or 10% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The growth in net sales during the first quarter of 2013 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launch of iPhone 5 and
strong demand for iPad, partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment represented 7% and 8% of the Companys total net sales for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Retail Net sales in the Retail segment increased $325 million or 5% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The growth in net sales during the first quarter of 2013 was primarily
driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launch of iPhone 5 and strong demand for iPad following the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad. The growth rate of the Retail segment was somewhat lower than the Companys
overall growth rate primarily as a result of expanded third-party distribution of iPhone and iPad. The Company opened 11 new retail stores during the first quarter of 2013, 10 of which were outside the United States, ending the quarter with 401
stores open compared to 361 stores at the end of the first quarter of 2012. With an average of 396 and 358 stores opened during the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $16.3 million in the first
quarter of 2013, compared to $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. However, given the 14th week added to the first quarter of 2012, revenue per store on a per week basis increased 3% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The Retail segment represented 12% and
13% of the Companys total net sales in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Retail segment reported
operating income of $1.6 billion during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $1.9 billion during the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year decrease in Retail operating income during the first quarter of 2013 was primarily attributable to an
overall decline in the segments gross margin percentage similar to that experienced by the Company overall that was only partially offset by the relatively modest increase in the Retail segments net sales. As of December 29, 2012,
the Retail segment had approximately 44,700 full-time equivalent employees. Gross Margin Gross margin for the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was as follows (in millions, except gross margin
percentages):

44.7%
The gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2013 was 38.6% compared to 44.7% in the first quarter
of 2012. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin during the first quarter of 2013 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing, introduction of
iPad mini with gross margin significantly below the Companys average product margins, price reductions on certain existing products, and the impact of the significant number of product introductions during the quarter on product transition
costs. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of iPhone during the first quarter of 2013. The Company expects
its gross margin percentage to be lower in 2013 than experienced in 2012, and the Company anticipates gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5% during the second quarter of 2013. The lower gross margin expected in 2013 is largely due to
anticipation of a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. Future strengthening of the
U.S. dollar could further negatively impact gross margin. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected
gross margin percentage in 2013 and the second quarter of 2013 are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including, but not limited to, those set forth below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk
Factors of this Form 10-Q and those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product
pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in
the Companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also
be affected by the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significant international operations, financial results can be
significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, were as follows (in millions, except for percentages):

Research and Development (R&D) Expense R&D expense increased 33% or $252 million to $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $758 million in the first quarter
of 2012. This increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and
enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense SG&A expense increased $235 million or 9% to $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter
of 2012. The year-over-year increase in SG&A expense was due primarily to increases in overall headcount and related expenses, higher spending on professional services, and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the
Companys net sales. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three months ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, was as follows (in millions):

Total other income and expense increased by $325 million during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the
first quarter of 2012. The increase in other income and expense during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the Companys higher cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.07% and 1.02% in the first quarter of
2013 and 2012, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2013 was 26.0% compared with 25.3% for the first quarter of 2012. The Companys effective rate for both periods differs from the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The higher effective tax rate
during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the same quarter of 2012 is due primarily to a lower proportion of foreign earnings in the current year. The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the
Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through
2009. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments
that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the
Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 29, 2012, the Company had $137.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, an increase of $15.9 billion from September 29, 2012. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $23.4 billion, which was partially offset by payments made for acquisition of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of $2.5 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion and cash paid under the Companys accelerated share repurchase program of $1.95 billion. The Companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. As of December 29, 2012 and
September 29, 2012, $94.2 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts
held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, common stock repurchases, dividends on its common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Assets The
Companys capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2013 consisting of $82 million for retail store facilities and $1.3 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2013 were $2.3 billion. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $10 billion for capital expenditures during 2013, including approximately $850 million
for retail store facilities and approximately $9.15 billion for other capital expenditures, including for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware,
software and enhancements. During 2013, the Company expects to open approximately 30 new retail stores, with approximately
three-quarters located outside of the U.S. Dividend and Stock Repurchase Program Subject to declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company plans to pay quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share for a total of
approximately $2.5 billion each quarter. In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10
billion of the Companys common stock beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is authorized through 2015 with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchases under
the Companys equity plans. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. The Company anticipates that it will utilize approximately $45 billion of domestic cash to pay dividends, repurchase
shares, and to remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units in the first three years of the dividend and stock repurchase programs. The Company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the repurchase
program will come primarily from current domestic cash and from on-going U.S. operating activities and the cash generated from such activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent
arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the
Company. Lease Commitments The Companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for
terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of December 29, 2012, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were
$4.5 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to leases for retail space. Purchase Commitments with Outsourcing Partners and Component
Suppliers The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products
and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also
obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on
projected demand information. As of December 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $18.9 billion. Other Obligations In
addition to the commitments mentioned above, the Company had additional off-balance sheet obligations of $904 million as of December 29, 2012, that were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and
manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. The Companys other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest
and penalties. As of December 29, 2012, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $15.7 billion. Additionally, as of December 29, 2012, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion and an additional $444
million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
Indemnification The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company
may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement
costs related to indemnification as of December 29, 2012 or September 29, 2012. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive
officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements
historically have not been material.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companys market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of its 2012 Form 10-K have not changed materially for
the first three months of 2013.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
were effective as of December 29, 2012 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2013, which were
identified in connection with managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
The
Company is subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims
brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period
for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. See the risk factors The Company is frequently involved in
intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property rights and The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings in Part II, Item 1A of this
Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2013 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and
results of operations. The Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation (formerly Charoensak v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Tucker v. Apple
Computer, Inc.); Somers v. Apple Inc. These related cases have been filed on January 3, 2005, July 21, 2006
and December 31, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class of direct and indirect purchasers of iPods and iTunes Store content, alleging various claims including alleged
unlawful tying of music and video purchased on the iTunes Store with the purchase of iPods and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly market power under §§1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, California
Business & Professions Code §17200 (unfair competition), the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act and California monopolization law. Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for the class, treble damages,
injunctive relief, disgorgement of revenues and/or profits and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs are also seeking digital rights management free versions of any songs downloaded from iTunes or an order requiring the Company to license its digital rights
management to all competing music players. The cases are currently pending. Apple eBooks Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v.
Apple Inc., et al.) On April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) filed a civil antitrust
action against the Company and five major book publishers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and seeking,
among other things, injunctive relief, the District Courts declaration that the Companys agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Courts reformation of such agreements. The DOJs complaint
asserts, among other things, that the decision by the five publishers to shift to an agency model to sell eBooks and their agreements with the Company were an attempt to raise, fix and stabilize retail e-book prices, to end price competition
among e-book retailers, and to limit retail price competition. The Company filed a response to the DOJ complaint in late May 2012, denying the DOJs allegations, and it intends to vigorously contest the lawsuit. The lawsuit is now in
discovery, with an initial trial date set for June 2013. Four of the five publishers have reached a settlement with the DOJ, which required the publishers to terminate their agreements with the Company and renegotiate new agreements pursuant to the
terms of their settlement with the DOJ. Three of the settlements have been approved by the District Court and the fourth settlement is pending approval.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Companys business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K
under the heading Risk Factors. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any
one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Companys actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, results of operations and financial condition. Any of these
factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and common stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic
conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. For example, the continuing sovereign debt crisis, financial
market volatility, and other factors in Europe have resulted in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the
Companys products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Companys expectations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening
of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and
other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services. In the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the financial
services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets.
This could have a number of effects on the Companys business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture
products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Companys products; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions.
Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities
and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would
increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the Companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
The Companys products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price
cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of
technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. The Companys
ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly
the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development. The Company currently holds
a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing
and very low cost structures, and emulating the Companys products and infringing its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if
competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property, the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces
substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. Additionally, the Company
faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions
that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some
of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may
be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their
individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to
maintain their functional and design advantages. The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market
share in the personal computer market. This market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of competitors,
many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors
selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers
compete for market share with the Companys existing products. The Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design
advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete
effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and
transitions. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the
Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number
of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software
for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new
products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net
realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities, for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair
market value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given
the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company must
order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders
and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Companys
markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm
purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.
Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant
supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into various
agreements for the supply of 
components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. The follow-on effects from global economic conditions
on the Companys suppliers, described in Global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company above, also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. The Company expects its gross margin percentage to be lower in 2013 than experienced in 2012. The lower gross margin expected in 2013 is largely due to anticipation of a
higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. Future strengthening of the U.S. dollar could
further negatively impact gross margin. The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media
devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The
Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing
capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Companys requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are located outside
of the U.S. Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing
partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and
distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may
contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the
Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Outsourcing partners in Asia perform final assembly of substantially
all of the Companys hardware products. Manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information
technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made
prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or
other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted. The Company relies on
third-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such
licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. The Company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the iTunes Store. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the
continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. 
Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the
Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of
content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Many third-party
content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company
will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management,
which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers. The Company is frequently involved in intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property rights. Technology companies, including many of the Companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent
infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it
have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against
the Company has significantly increased. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in Europe and Asia. The
plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the scope or validity of such
patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
Companys operations, and distracting to management. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to pay
substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given
that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses. In managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or
more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected. The Companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software
applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be
developed and maintained for the Companys products, customers may choose not to buy the Companys products. With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party
software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windows-based products.
This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of Mac sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the
Companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys products and more inclined to
devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. With respect to iOS devices, the
Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are
available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Companys customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the iOS platform. In addition, iOS devices are
subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with
applications for the Companys Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Companys products rather
than its competitors platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer. The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added
resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small
and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone
typically subsidize users purchase of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters
into with new carriers. Many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak
economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.
The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and
marketing of the Companys products. The Companys Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial
investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Companys retail
stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have
been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially
more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in
significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys
control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Companys inability to manage costs
associated with store construction and operation, the Companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with
unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant
risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence. These new
ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Companys products and services may experience quality problems from
time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation. The
Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can
unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. The Companys online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases
from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to
the Companys reputation. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the
Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business. The Company is
subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor,
advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and
export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company
operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or mandating the use of devices on
more than one carriers network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes
are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the Company from selling certain products.Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the
aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has
implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the
Companys policies. The Companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including
its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the
Companys key personnel are located. The Companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health
issues, natural disasters and other circumstances. War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and
other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors
and customers, including channel partners. The Companys business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes,
public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners,
or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee
travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys
manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant
expenditures in order to resume operations. The Companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system
failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network
disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may
be ineffective or inadequate, and the Companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Companys online stores and services, preclude retail store
transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and
financial reporting. The Company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage business partner and
customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, and could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. The Companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information
(PII). This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across
various industries, the Company may be at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII managed. The Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage
of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to Company data or
accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems. To help
protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. The Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other
security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. The Company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data, which could damage business partner and
customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Companys
reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the Companys products and services could decrease. The Company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. The Companys business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.
The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and
transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company
has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability.
The Companys privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website.
Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could
result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. The Company is also subject to payment card
association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In
addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.
The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys software, accessories, and
service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products. Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product
transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition,
the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, the
strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due in part to holiday seasonal demand. Actual and anticipated timing of new
product introductions by the Company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the Company in any particular quarter. The Company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated
demand for the Companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Companys stock price is subject to volatility. The Companys stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry, and the
stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. The Company believes its stock price reflects
expectations of future growth and profitability. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S.
and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition
regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Companys employees, contractors, or agents
could nevertheless occur. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international
activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Companys
products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including
duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit
risk and avoid losses. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to
non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. For example, the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring
efforts by European governments may cause the value of several European currencies, including the euro, to fluctuate, which could adversely affect the Companys non-U.S. dollar sales and operating expenses in the impacted jurisdictions.
Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially
reducing demand for the Companys products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the
U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currency-denominated
sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the
Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The
Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion
of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The
Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. The Company has not
recognized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, but could experience significant declines in the market value of its investment portfolio. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has both
domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result,
the value and liquidity of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and
prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.
The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has
made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of December 29, 2012, a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables were concentrated within cellular network carriers,
and its non-trade receivables and long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade
receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
Companys operations, and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary
damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax
liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and
political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change. The Companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The
Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.

(a)
 In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Companys common stock beginning in
2013. The repurchase program is authorized through 2015 and at December 29, 2012, the remaining repurchase amount under the program was $8.05 billion but does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
In August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program
(ASR) with a financial institution to purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Companys common stock in 2013. In exchange for an up-front payment of $1.95 billion, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during
the ASRs purchase period, which ends later in 2013. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume weighted average
price of the Companys stock during that period. In the first quarter of 2013, 2,582,782 shares were initially delivered to the Company. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. These shares were retired
and accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

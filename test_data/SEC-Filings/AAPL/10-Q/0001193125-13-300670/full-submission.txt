Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) designs,
manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and
applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the
Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and
education, enterprise and government customers. Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. These condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the
2012 Form 10-K). The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal year 2013 will include 52 weeks, whereas fiscal year 2012 included 53 weeks. An additional
week was included in the first quarter of 2012 to realign the Companys fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Companys fiscal
years ended in September and the associated quarters, months or periods of those fiscal years. During the first quarter of
2013, the Company adopted amended accounting standards that changed the presentation of comprehensive income. These standards increased the prominence of other comprehensive income (OCI) by eliminating the option to present components of
OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and required the components of OCI to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. The amended accounting
standards only impacted the financial statement presentation of OCI and did not change the components that are recognized in net income or OCI; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of
operations. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Companys employee stock purchase plan and unvested restricted stock units
(RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the
Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the
three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Potentially dilutive securities representing 5.1 million and 4.4 million shares of common stock
for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. The number of potentially dilutive securities excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive was not significant for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2012. Note 2  Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The following tables show the Companys cash and available-for-sale securities adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category

(a)
 The fair value of Level 1 securities is estimated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


(b)
 The fair value of Level 2 securities is estimated based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
The net unrealized losses as of June 29, 2013 and net unrealized gains as of September 29, 2012
are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and
duration management. The net realized gains or losses recognized by the Company related to such sales were not significant during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012. The maturities of the Companys
long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years. As of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012,
gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. As of June 29, 2013, the Company considered the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and did not consider any of its investments
other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade,
with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates, and the Companys intent to sell, or
whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis. During the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, the Company did not
recognize any significant impairment charges. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Company may enter
into forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities.
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion
of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six
months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To help protect against adverse fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other
instruments to offset a portion of the changes in income or expense due to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company may
also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the
Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Companys accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net
investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging
instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company had a net deferred gain of $348 million and a net deferred loss of $240 million associated with cash flow hedges, net of
taxes, recorded in AOCI as of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the
related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses
associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The majority of the Companys hedged foreign currency
transactions and hedged interest rate transactions as of June 29, 2013 are expected to occur within six months and five years, respectively. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are
reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during
the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012. The Companys unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of AOCI, were not significant as of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012. The ineffective portions of and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other
income and expense. The gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts
not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not
include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts. The following table shows the notional principal amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts
associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012 (in millions):

The notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that
are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency and interest rates. Although the table above reflects the notional
principal and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon
settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of
transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of June 29, 2013, the Company received $642 million of cash collateral related to the
derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2012, the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative
instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $278 million, which it recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related
contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of June 29, 2013 or September 29, 2012. The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments at gross fair value as

Accounts Receivable The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,
enterprise and government customers that are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. There was one customer that accounted for 13% of the Companys trade receivables as of June 29, 2013. As of
September 29, 2012, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. The Companys cellular network carriers accounted for 59% and 66% of trade
receivables as of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively. Additionally, the Company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Companys vendors accounted for 54% and 26% of total non-trade receivables as of June 29, 2013 and three of the Companys vendors
accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of September 29, 2012. Note 3  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Companys condensed consolidated financial statement details as of June 29,

Note 4  Income Taxes As of June 29, 2013, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $3.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion,
if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 29, 2012, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective
tax rate. The Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $501 million and $401 million of gross interest and penalties accrued as
of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively, which are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company
could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could
reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $125 million and $225 million in the next 12 months. Note 5  Long-Term Debt In May 2013, the Company issued floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal
amount of $17 billion (collectively the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes. The principal amounts and associated interest rates of the Notes as of June 29, 2013, are as follows:

The floating-rate notes due 2016 and 2018 bear interest at the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus 0.05% and 0.25%, respectively. To manage the risk associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3 billion designated as cash flow hedges of its
floating-rate notes. These hedges effectively convert the floating interest rate on the floating-rate notes to a fixed interest rate. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in OCI with a
portion reclassified to interest expense each period to offset changes in interest rates on the floating-rate notes. The effective rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if applicable, adjustments
related to hedging. The Company recognized $53 million of interest expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013. As of June 29, 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for the Companys Notes was $42 million.

As of June 29, 2013, the fair value of the Companys Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $16.1
billion. Note 6  Shareholders Equity and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Stock The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors
is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. Dividend and Share Repurchase Program The Company declared and paid cash

No dividends were paid by the Company during the first three quarters of 2012. Future dividends are
subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a program to
repurchase up to $10 billion of the Companys common stock beginning in 2013. In April 2013, the Companys Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $18 billion had
been utilized as of June 29, 2013. The Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions,
including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). In August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (ASR) with a financial institution to purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Companys common stock in
2013. In the first quarter of 2013, 2.6 million shares were initially delivered to the Company. In April 2013, the purchase period for the ASR ended and an additional 1.5 million shares were delivered to the Company. In total,
4.1 million shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $478.20 per share. The shares were retired in the quarters they were delivered, and the up-front payment of $1.95 billion was accounted for as a reduction to
shareholders equity in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in the first quarter of 2013. In April
2013, the Company entered into a new ASR program with two financial institutions to purchase up to $12 billion of the Companys common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $12 billion, the financial institutions committed to
deliver shares during the ASRs purchase periods, which will end during 2014. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based
on the volume weighted average price of the Companys stock during that period. During the third quarter of 2013, 23.5 million shares were initially delivered to the Company and retired. This does not represent the final number of shares
to be delivered under the ASR. The up-front payments of $12 billion were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company reflected the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts
indexed to its own common stock. The forward contracts met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments. During the third quarter of 2013, the Company also repurchased 9.0 million shares of its common stock in the open market at an
average price of $446.74 per share for a total of $4.0 billion. These shares were retired upon repurchase. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The following table shows the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012 (in millions):

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Companys closing stock price on
the last trading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The total intrinsic value of options at the time of exercise was $180 million and $738 million for
the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013, respectively, and $332 million and $1.5 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. The Company had approximately 28.8 million shares reserved for future issuance under the Companys stock plans as of
June 29, 2013. RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for
grant under the Companys stock plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common
stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is measured at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as
calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest rates. The Company recognizes
share-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics. The Company granted 8,000 stock options, which had a weighted-average grant date fair value of $294.84 per share, during the three- and
nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013. The Company did not grant any stock options during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2012. The weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $107.98 and $118.96
during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013, respectively, and was $114.01 and $102.41 during the three- and nine-months ended June 30, 2012, respectively. In conjunction with certain business combinations, the Company assumed 29,000 stock options with a weighted-average fair value per share
of $407.80 during the nine-month period ended June 29, 2013 and 41,000 stock options with a weighted-average fair value per share of $400.79 during the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012. The following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore,
the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either June 29, 2013 or September 29, 2012. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains
directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components
are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and
significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar
terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the Companys requirements. Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing
partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced
suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its
outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Long-Term Supply Agreements The Company has entered into long-term
agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. Under certain of these agreements, which expire between 2013 and 2022, the Company has made prepayments for the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired capital
equipment to use in the manufacturing of such components. As of June 29, 2013, the Company had a total of $3.3 billion
of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $1.1 billion are classified as other current assets and $2.2 billion are classified as other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had a total of $4.2 billion of
inventory component prepayments outstanding as of September 29, 2012. The Companys outstanding prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement. During the three- and
nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013, the Company utilized $269 million and $946 million of inventory component prepayments, respectively. Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments The Company leases various equipment
and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10
years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As
of June 29, 2013, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.6 billion, of which $3.3 billion related to leases for retail space. The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final
assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual
components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected
demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of June 29, 2013, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet
third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $13.0 billion. In addition to the commitments
mentioned above, the Company had additional off-balance sheet obligations of $1.4 billion as of June 29, 2013, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment,
and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. Contingencies The
Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading
Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or
a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more
of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected. Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al. On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd
and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On March 1, 2013, the District Court upheld $599 million of the jurys award and ordered a new trial as to the remainder.
Because the award is subject to entry of final judgment, partial re-trial and appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its results of operations. VirnetX, Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al. On August 11, 2010, VirnetX, Inc.
filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on four patents relating to network communications technology. On November 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded damages of $368
million. The Company is challenging the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded a loss accrual at this time. Note 8  Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Prior to 2013, the Companys reportable operating segments consisted of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. In
2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment. Segment data for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect establishment of the Greater China segment.
The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment
includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan and those countries included in the Greater China segment. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Americas, Europe, Greater
China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as
those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various
nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. Prior to 2013, the Company did not allocate certain manufacturing costs and variances, including costs related to product
tooling and manufacturing process equipment, to its operating segments and instead included these costs and variances in other corporate expenses. In 2013, the Company began allocating these costs and variances to its operating segments and as a
result reclassified costs of $146 million and a net credit of $48 million from corporate expenses to its operating segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by operating segment for the three- and nine-month
periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012 (in millions):

Item 2.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of  future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any
historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements also can be identified by words such as anticipates, expects, believes, will, would, could, can,
future, and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that
might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 29, 2012 (the 2012 Form 10-K) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and the condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years, quarters, months or
periods refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months, or periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the Company and Apple as used herein refers collectively to Apple
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Available Information The Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports
filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the SEC. The Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and files or furnishes

Further, the Companys references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. Executive Overview The Company designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services,
peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Companys products and services include iPhone®, iPad®, Mac®, iPod®, Apple TV®, a portfolio of
consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and OS X® operating systems, iCloud®, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also sells and delivers digital content and
applications through the iTunes Store®, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. The Company sells
its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of
third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and
government customers. The Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative
hardware, software, peripherals, and services. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and
solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes
Store. As part of the iTunes Store, the Companys App Store and iBookstore allow customers to discover and download applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through iOS devices, namely iPhone, iPad
and iPod touch. The Companys Mac App Store allows customers to easily discover, download and install Mac applications. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content
that complement the Companys offerings. The Companys strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including the market for
mobile communications and media devices with its iOS devices; personal computers with its Mac computers; portable digital players with iPod; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications with the iTunes Store, App Store,
iBookstore, and Mac App Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that
continual investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. The Companys research and development spending is focused on investing in new
hardware and software products, and in further developing its existing products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod hardware; iOS and OS X operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services. The Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales
force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of
the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of
its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which
service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales
by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a
high level of integration and support services, and product expertise. Products In June 2013, the Company announced new versions of its operating systems, iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, both of which are expected to be
available in the fall of 2013. The Company also released updated versions of MacBook Air. A detailed discussion of the
Companys products may be found in Part I, Item 1, Business, of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K. Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that
affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8 of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and
estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income
taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments
and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been
transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers
revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is
essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software
accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the
hardware. For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware
products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling
prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that
deliverable. ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers.
The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is
allocated to these rights and services based on the Companys ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Companys ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. The Companys process for determining ESPs involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are
expected to be provided, or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Companys ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future
sales of these devices could change. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price
protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the
other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the
Companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for
expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue.
Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of
particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Companys results of
operations. Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities The Companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes
in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Companys
net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. The Company
regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the
Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it will more
likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Companys assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in
assumptions related to any particular security. Inventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase
Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to
secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable
value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The Company
also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not
recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to
record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or manufacturing-related capital assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Companys products being less favorable than forecasted,
unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Companys
suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturing process equipment or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period when the
write-downs were recorded. The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have
been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing
requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products, if the Companys product development plans change, or if there is an unanticipated change in
technological requirements for any of the Companys products, then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees
are identified and recorded. Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed
base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially
affect the Companys results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes tax
benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to
the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP
and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is
reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company
may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject
to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Net Sales The following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012 (in millions,

The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last
Saturday of September. An extra week is added to the Companys first quarter approximately every six years to realign the Companys fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. A 14th week was added to the first quarter of 2012, while the first quarter
of 2013 spanned only 13 weeks. Inclusion of the 14th week
increased the Companys overall net sales and operating expenses for the first nine months of 2012 compared to 2013. Product
Performance iPhone Net sales of iPhone were $18.2 billion and $71.8 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, increases of $2.3 billion or 15% and $9.7 billion or 16% compared to the same
periods in 2012. iPhone unit sales totaled 31.2 million and 116.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, increases of 20% and 19% compared to the same periods in 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, iPhone
year-over-year growth resulted from strong demand for iPhone in all of the Companys operating segments primarily due to the launch of iPhone 5 beginning in September 2012 and strong ongoing demand for iPhone 4 and 4S. All of the Companys
operating segments except Greater China experienced increases in net sales and unit sales of iPhone during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The year-over-year impact of higher iPhone unit sales was partially offset
during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 by reductions in iPhone average selling prices in almost all of the Companys operating segments primarily as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower-priced iPhone models,
particularly iPhone 4. Net sales of iPhone accounted for 51% and 45% of the Companys total net sales for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were 54% and 51% of the Companys total net sales during the first nine months
of 2013 and 2012, respectively. iPad Net sales of iPad were $6.4 billion and $25.8 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively. While iPad net sales during the third quarter of 2013 decreased $2.4 billion or 27%
compared to the third quarter of 2012, iPad net sales increased by $2.0 billion or 8% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Unit sales of iPad were 14.6 million and 57.0 million during the third quarter and first
nine months of 2013, respectively, a decrease of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2012 and an increase of 29% compared to the first nine months of 2012. The increase in net sales and unit sales of iPad during the first nine months of 2013
resulted from strong growth in unit sales in all of the Companys operating segments. This growth was driven by the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year growth rate of
total iPad unit sales was higher than the growth rate of total iPad net sales during the first nine months of 2013 due to a reduction in average selling prices in all of the Companys operating segments primarily as a result of the introduction
of iPad mini and a price reduction on iPad 2. The year-over-year decrease in net sales of iPad during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 reflects the reduction in average selling price in all of the Companys
operating segments and lower iPad unit sales in all of the Companys operating segments except Japan. The launch of the third-generation iPad in many countries around the world beginning March 2012 without a comparable new iPad product
introduction in the same period in 2013 contributed to the decline in third quarter iPad unit sales. Net sales of iPad accounted for 18% and 25% of the Companys total net sales for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were
19% and 20% of the Companys total net sales during the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Mac Net sales of Mac were $4.9 billion and $15.9 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, decreases of $40
million or 1% and $745 million or 4% compared to the same periods in 2012. Mac unit sales decreased by 266 thousand or 7% and 1.5 million or 11% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. Mac net sales
and unit sales for the first nine months of 2013 were relatively flat or somewhat down in all of the Companys operating segments. The decline in Mac net sales reflects the overall weakness in the market for personal computers. Net sales of Mac
accounted for 14% of the Companys total net sales in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were 12% and 14% of the Companys total net sales during the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. iTunes, Software and Services Net sales of iTunes, software and services were $4.0 billion and $11.8 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, increases of $787 million or 25% and $2.4 billion or 26%
compared to the same periods in 2012. These increases were primarily due to growth in net sales from iTunes, AppleCare and licensing. iTunes generated total net sales of $2.4 billion and $6.9 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of
2013 compared to net sales of $1.8 billion and $5.5 billion during the same periods in 2012. iTunes growth reflects continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices and expanded offerings of iTunes digital content and applications around the
world, resulting in higher net sales on the App Store and higher net sales of digital content. Net sales of iTunes, software and services accounted for 11% and 9% of the Companys total net sales for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012,
respectively, and were 9% and 8% of the Companys total net sales during the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Prior to 2013, the Companys reportable operating segments consisted of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. In
2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment. Segment data for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect establishment of the Greater China segment.
The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment
includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan and those countries included in the Greater China segment. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Americas, Europe, Greater
China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating
segments may be found in Note 8, Segment Information and Geographic Data in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Americas Net sales in the Americas segment increased $1.6 billion or 12% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $5.1 billion or 12% during the first nine months of
2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The growth in net sales during the first nine months of 2013 was driven by increased sales of iPhone, increased sales of iPad, particularly iPad mini, and higher sales from iTunes. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in net sales of iPod and, to a lesser extent, Mac. The growth in net sales during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily reflects growth in net sales of iPhone and higher sales from
iTunes, partially offset by declines in net sales of iPad, Mac and iPod. The Americas segments net sales were 41% and 37% of the Companys total net sales in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 36% of total net sales
for both the first nine months of 2013 and 2012. Europe Net sales in the Europe segment decreased $623 million or 8% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $1.6 billion or 6% during the first nine months of 2013
compared to the same period in 2012. Net sales during the third quarter of 2013 were negatively impacted by reductions of both iPhone and iPad channel inventory, and reflect decreases in net sales of iPad, iPod and, to a lesser extent, Mac. These
factors were partially offset by increases in net sales of iPhone and higher sales from iTunes. The growth in net sales during the first nine months of 2013 was primarily driven by increased sales of iPhone, iPad and higher sales from iTunes. These
increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod. Net sales in the Europe segment continue to be negatively impacted by the regions uncertain economic conditions. The Europe segments net sales were 21% and 23% of
the Companys total net sales in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 22% and 24% of total net sales for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Greater China Net sales in the Greater China segment decreased $748
million or 14% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $2.6 billion or 15% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The growth in net sales during the first nine months
of 2013 was primarily driven by the launch of iPhone 5 in China during the first quarter of 2013 and by the impact of launching the fourth generation iPad and iPad mini during the second quarter of 2013. The decrease in net sales during the third
quarter of 2013 was driven primarily by reduction of both iPhone and iPad channel inventory and a small decrease in demand for iPhone, partially offset by a small increase in demand for iPad. Furthermore, iPad sales in Hong Kong in the third quarter
of 2012 were favorably impacted by the launch of the third-generation iPad without a comparable new iPad product introduction in the same period in 2013. The Greater China segments net sales were 13% and 15% of the Companys total net
sales for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 15% and 14% of total net sales for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Japan Net sales in the Japan segment increased $534 million or 27% during
the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $1.9 billion or 23% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The growth in net sales during the third quarter and first nine months of
2013 resulted primarily from increased unit sales of iPhone and iPad, higher sales from iTunes, and an increase in iPhone channel inventory during the third quarter of 2013. These factors were partially offset by the impact of the increased strength
of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese Yen. The Japan segments net sales were 7% and 6% of the Companys total net sales for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 8% and 7% of total net sales for the first nine
months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Rest of Asia Pacific Net sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment decreased $452 million or 18% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $570 million or 7% during the first nine
months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The decrease in net sales during the third quarter of 2013 was primarily driven by decreased net sales of iPad and iPod, partially offset by increased net sales of iPhone and higher sales from
iTunes. The growth in net sales during the first nine months of 2013 was primarily driven by the launch of iPhone 5 and higher sales from iTunes, partially offset by a decrease in net sales of iPad and Mac. The Rest of Asia Pacific
segments net sales were 6% and 7% of the Companys total net sales for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 7% of total net sales for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012. Retail Net sales in the Retail segment decreased $10 million during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $1.2 billion or 8% during the first nine months of 2013 compared
to the same period in 2012. The decrease in net sales during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was primarily driven by decreased net sales of iPad and iPod, partially offset by increased net sales of iPhone, Mac, software
and services, and accessories. The growth in net sales during the first nine months of 2013 was primarily driven by increased unit sales of iPhone and iPad and increased sales of software and services, and accessories. The Company opened six new
retail stores during the third quarter of 2013, five of which were outside the United States, ending the quarter with 408 stores compared to 372 stores at the end of the third quarter of 2012. With an average of 405 and 367 open stores during the
third quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2013, compared to $11.1 million in the third quarter of 2012. Average revenue per store was $39.3 million and
$40.3 million for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Retail segments net sales were 12% of the Companys total net sales in both the third quarters of 2013 and 2012 and both the first nine months of 2013 and
2012. The Retail segment reported operating income of $667 million during the third quarter of 2013 as compared to $828
million during the third quarter of 2012, and reported operating income of $3.3 billion during the first nine months of 2013 compared to $3.8 billion during the first nine months of 2012. The year-over-year decrease in Retail operating income during
the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 was primarily attributable to an overall decline in the Retail segments gross margin percentage similar to that experienced by the Company overall. As of June 29, 2013, the Retail segment had
approximately 41,700 full-time equivalent employees. Gross Margin Gross margin for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012 was as follows (in millions, except
gross margin percentages):

The gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2013 was 36.9% compared to 42.8% in the third quarter
of 2012, and the gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2013 was 37.8% compared to 45.0% in the first nine months of 2012. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 was driven by
multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing, introduction of iPad mini with gross margin significantly below the Companys average product margins, higher
expenses associated with changes to certain of the Companys service policies and other warranty costs, and price reductions on certain products, including iPad 2 and iPhone 4. The Company expects its gross margin percentage to be lower in 2013 than experienced in 2012, and the Company anticipates gross margin to
be between 36% and 37% during the fourth quarter of 2013. The lower gross margin expected in 2013 is largely due to anticipation of a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver
greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. Future strengthening of the U.S. dollar could further negatively impact gross margin. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin percentage in
2013 and the fourth quarter of 2013 are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q and
those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased
competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a
potential shift in the Companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross
margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significant international operations, financial
results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, were as follows (in millions,

Research and Development (R&D) Expense R&D expense increased $302 million or 34% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012 and increased $832
million or 34% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. These increases were primarily due to an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe
that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business
strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Selling, General and Administrative
(SG&A) Expense SG&A expense increased $100 million or 4% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to
the third quarter of 2012, and increased $668 million or 9% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. These increases were primarily due to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment and increased
headcount and related expenses, partially offset by lower spending on professional services. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, was as follows (in millions):

Total other income and expense decreased by $54 million during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the
third quarter of 2012, and increased by $470 million during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The overall decrease in other income and expense during the third quarter of 2013 was due primarily to interest expense on
debt and remeasurement losses from foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income resulting from the Companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The overall increase in
other income and expense over the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the Companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower
premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on debt. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.00% and 1.06% in the third quarters
of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 1.04% and 1.03% in the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes
The Companys effective tax rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2013 were 26.9% and
26.2%, respectively, compared to 25.6% and 25.3% for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. The Companys effective rates for both periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily
to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The
higher effective tax rate during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 as compared to the same periods of 2012 is due primarily to a lower proportion of foreign earnings in 2013. The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the
years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2004
have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012 (in

As of June 29, 2013, the Company had $146.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, an increase of $25.4 billion from September 29, 2012. The principal components of this net increase were the cash generated by operating activities of $43.8 billion and the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9
billion, which was partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock of $18 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $7.8 billion and payments made for acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets of $6.8 billion. The Companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in
highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. As of June 29, 2013 and September 29, 2012, $106.0 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be
sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company anticipates the cash used for future
dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. Long-Term Debt In May 2013, the Company issued floating- and fixed-rate
notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $17 billion, of which $2.5 billion is due in 2016 and $14.5 billion is due between 2018 and 2043. Capital Assets The Companys capital expenditures were $5.2 billion
during the first nine months of 2013 consisting of $309 million for retail store facilities and $4.9 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and other corporate facilities and
infrastructure. The Companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2013 were $6.2 billion. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $8.5 billion for capital expenditures during 2013, including approximately $600 million for retail store facilities and approximately $7.9 billion for other
capital expenditures, including for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements. During 2013, the Company expects to open approximately 27 new retail stores, with more than three-quarters located outside of the U.S.
Dividend and Share Repurchase Program In April 2013, the Company announced it was raising its third quarter 2013 cash dividend by 15% to $3.05 per common share. The Company expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends of $3.05 per common
share each quarter, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Companys common stock. In April 2013, the Companys Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $18 billion
had been utilized as of June 29, 2013. The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 2015. The Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program,
shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. Beginning in August 2012 through December 2015, the Company anticipates it will utilize approximately $100 billion to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and to remit withheld taxes related to net share
settlement of restricted stock units, of which $29 billion had been utilized through June 29, 2013. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the
Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable
interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. Lease Commitments The Companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for
terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of June 29, 2013, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were
$4.6 billion, of which $3.3 billion related to leases for retail space. Purchase Commitments with Outsourcing Partners and Component
Suppliers The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products
and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also
obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case
based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of June 29, 2013, the Company had outstanding
off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $13.0 billion. Other Obligations
In addition to the commitments mentioned above, the Company had additional off-balance sheet obligations of $1.4 billion
as of June 29, 2013, that were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and
telecommunications services and other obligations. The Companys other non-current liabilities in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of June 29, 2013, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.1 billion.
Additionally, as of June 29, 2013, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $3.4 billion and an additional $501 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to
make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. Indemnification
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims
that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the
opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of June 29, 2013 or September 29, 2012. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains
directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
In the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17 billion of long-term debt, which included $3 billion of floating-rate notes. To manage the risk associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company
entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate notes. The Companys market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of its 2012 Form 10-K have not changed materially for the nine months ended June 29, 2013.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
were effective as of June 29, 2013 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2013, which were
identified in connection with managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
The
Company is subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims
brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period
for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. See the risk factors The Company is frequently involved in
intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property rights and The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings in Part II, Item 1A of this Form
10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2013 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of
operations. The Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation (formerly Charoensak v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Tucker v. Apple Computer, Inc.);
Somers v. Apple Inc. These related cases were filed on January 3, 2005, July 21, 2006 and December 31,
2007 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class of direct and indirect purchasers of iPods and iTunes Store content, alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music
and video purchased on the iTunes Store with the purchase of iPods and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly market power under §§1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, California Business & Professions Code
§17200 (unfair competition), the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act and California monopolization law. Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for the class, treble damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement of
revenues and/or profits and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs are also seeking digital rights management free versions of any songs downloaded from iTunes or an order requiring the Company to license its digital rights management to all competing music
players. The cases are currently pending. Apple eBooks Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v. Apple Inc., et al.)
On April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) filed a civil antitrust action against the
Company and five major book publishers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and seeking, among other things,
injunctive relief, the District Courts declaration that the Companys agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Courts reformation of such agreements. The DOJs complaint asserted, among other
things, that the decision by the five publishers to shift to an agency model to sell eBooks and their agreements with the Company were an attempt to raise, fix and stabilize retail e-book prices, to end price competition among e-book
retailers, and to limit retail price competition. The Company filed a response to the DOJ complaint in late May 2012, denying the DOJs allegations. All five publishers reached a settlement with the DOJ, which required the publishers to
terminate their agreements with the Company and renegotiate new agreements pursuant to the terms of their settlement with the DOJ. On July 10, 2013, the District Court found, following a bench trial, that the Company conspired to restrain trade
in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with §1 of the Sherman Act. The District Court also stated that the plaintiffs in the case were entitled to injunctive relief and
that a trial on damages would follow. The Company intends to appeal the District Courts decision.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Companys business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Companys 2012 Form 10-K and
in Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 29, 2012 and March 30, 2013, in each case under the heading Risk Factors. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be
affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Companys actual results of operations and financial
condition to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition,
results of operations and common stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the
Companys financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future
periods. Global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic
conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. For example, the continuing sovereign debt crisis, financial
market volatility, and other factors in Europe have resulted in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the
Companys products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Companys expectations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening
of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and
other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services. In the event of further financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the
financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity
markets. This could have a number of effects on the Companys business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or
manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Companys products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial
institutions; and restricting the Companys ability to issue new debt. Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments;
impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased
volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the Companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values
currently assigned to them. Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid
technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Companys products
and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,
continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and
related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents,
trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Companys products and
infringing its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property, the Companys
ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company markets certain mobile communication and
media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate
the Companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate
ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels
than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also
expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Companys financial
condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This
market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines,
lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have
aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Companys
existing products. The Companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent
product introductions and transitions. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the
Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product
introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and
transitions. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.
The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated
demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and
inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can
be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with
industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory
component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Companys markets are
volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase
commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.
Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant
supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into various
agreements for the supply of components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. The follow-on effects from global economic conditions on the Companys
suppliers, described in Global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company above, also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to
significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. The Company expects its gross margin percentage to be lower in 2013 than experienced in 2012. The lower gross margin expected in 2013 is largely due to anticipation of a higher mix of new
and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. Future strengthening of the U.S. dollar could further negatively
impact gross margin. The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices
and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The
Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing
capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Companys requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are located outside
of the U.S. Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing
partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and
distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may
contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the
Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Outsourcing partners in Asia perform final assembly of substantially
all of the Companys hardware products. Manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information
technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made
prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or
other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted. The Company relies on
third-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such
licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. The Company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the iTunes Store. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the
continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult
or impossible for the Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to
offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Many third-party content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements
change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain
countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements
with the Companys content providers. The Company is frequently involved in intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have
infringed on intellectual property rights. Technology companies, including many of the Companys competitors,
frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the
Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold
significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S.
International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in Europe and Asia. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted
litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Companys operations, and distracting to management. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of
whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain
products. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no
assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses. In managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material
loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers
the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial
statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Companys future performance depends in part on
support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware
products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys
products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products, customers may choose not to buy the Companys products. With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part
on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the
market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of Mac sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Companys minority share of the global personal
computer market causes developers to question the Companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading
software for the larger Windows market. With respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and
development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the
availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Companys customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the iOS platform. In addition, iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if
third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Companys Mac products, the
availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Companys products rather than its competitors platforms, such as Android.
If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer. The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added
resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small
and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone
typically subsidize users purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters
into with new carriers. Many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak
economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.
The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and
marketing of the Companys products. The Companys Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial
investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Companys retail
stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have
been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially
more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in
significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs. Many factors
unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail
activity, as well as the Companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging environments in
managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business
and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business
strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified
issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The
Companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation. The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated
operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. The Companys online services may from time to time
experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software
and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the Companys reputation. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business.
The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of
areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of
services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data
privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to
mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of
devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by
cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the
Company from selling certain products.Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and
expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their
interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or
limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees, contractors, or agents will not
violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures. The Companys success depends largely on the
continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued
availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense,
especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Companys key personnel are located. The Companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues,
natural disasters and other circumstances. War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other
business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and
customers, including channel partners. The Companys business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor
disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel
partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent
employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys
manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant
expenditures in order to resume operations. The Companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system
failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network
disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may
be ineffective or inadequate, and the Companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Companys online stores and services, preclude retail store
transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and
financial reporting. The Company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage business partner and
customer relationships, could curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, and could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. The Companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information
(PII). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect
many companies across various industries, the Company may be at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII managed. The Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage
of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to Company data or
accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems. To help
protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. The Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and
data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. The Company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data, which could damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or
otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Companys reputation and brand could be materially
damaged and use of the Companys products and services could decrease. The Company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. The Companys business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and
other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to
the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its
subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be
inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in
penalties or significant legal liability. The Companys privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and
disclosure of data are posted on its website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or
data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. The
Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for
associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase
in payment card transaction costs. The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys software, accessories, and
service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products. Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product
transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition,
the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, the
strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due in part to holiday seasonal demand. Actual and anticipated timing of new
product introductions by the Company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the Company in any particular quarter. The Company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated
demand for the Companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Companys stock price is subject to volatility. The Companys stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and
volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock
to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will
continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors, and the Companys share repurchase program does
not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline
significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S.
and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition
regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Companys employees, contractors, or agents
could nevertheless occur. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international
activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Companys
products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including
duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit
risk and avoid losses. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to
non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. For example, the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring
efforts by European governments may cause the value of several European currencies, including the euro, to fluctuate, which could adversely affect the Companys non-U.S. dollar sales and operating expenses in the impacted jurisdictions.
Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially
reducing demand for the Companys products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the
U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currency-denominated
sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the
Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The
Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion
of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The
Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. The Company has not
recognized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, but could experience significant declines in the market value of its investment portfolio. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has both
domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result,
the value and liquidity of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods
when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its
trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other
vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of June 29, 2013, a
significant portion of the Companys trade receivables were concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its non-trade receivables and long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.
While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid
losses. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
Companys operations, and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary
damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax
liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a
number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in
the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to
the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination
of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Companys operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

(a)
 In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Companys common stock beginning in
2013. In April 2013, the Companys Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion. The Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of
shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The $42.1 billion represents the remaining amount available to
repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program. 

(b)
 In August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (ASR) with a financial institution to purchase up
to $1.95 billion of the Companys common stock. In April 2013, the purchase period for the ASR ended and an additional 1,494,992 shares were delivered and retired during the third quarter of 2013. In total, 4,077,774 shares were delivered
under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $478.20 per share. 

(c)
 In April 2013, the Company entered into a new ASR program with two financial institutions to purchase up to $12 billion of the Companys common
stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $12 billion, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the ASRs purchase periods, which will end during 2014. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore
the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume weighted average price of the Companys stock during that period. During the third quarter of 2013, 23,507,518 shares were
initially delivered to the Company and retired. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. The up-front payments of $12 billion were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the
Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

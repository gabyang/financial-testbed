PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron’s operations that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “advances,” “commits,” “drives,” “aims,” “forecasts,” “projects,” “believes,” “approaches,” “seeks,” “schedules,” “estimates,” “positions,” “pursues,” “may,” “can,”  “could,” “should,” “will,” “budgets,” “outlook,” “trends,” “guidance,” “focus,” “on track,” “goals,” “objectives,” “strategies,” “opportunities,” “poised,” “potential” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices and demand for our products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing countries; public health crises, such as pandemics (including coronavirus (COVID-19)) and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic and political conditions; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; the company’s ability to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and efficiencies associated with enterprise transformation initiatives; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas during the COVID-19 pandemic; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company’s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the receipt of required Board authorizations to pay future dividends; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 18 through 23 of the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. General
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (together, Chevron or the company) have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. In the opinion of the company’s management, the interim data includes all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. The results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021, are not necessarily indicative of future financial results. The term “earnings” is defined as net income attributable to Chevron.Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic The outbreak of COVID-19 and decreases in commodity prices resulting from oversupply, government-imposed travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity caused a significant decline in the demand for our products and created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace beginning late in the first quarter 2020, which negatively affected our results of operations and cash flows throughout 2020. While demand and commodity prices have largely recovered, demand is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and financial results could continue to be challenged in future quarters. There continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results, which could be material.

Note 6. Operating Segments and Geographic Data
Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of the refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. “All Other” activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).

Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major operating area for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, are presented in the following table:

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, are presented in the following table. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Note 7. Employee Benefits
Chevron has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.
13

Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
The company also sponsors other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and the retirees share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The components of net periodic benefit costs for 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

*  Includes costs for U.S. and international OPEB plans. Obligations for plans outside the United States are not significant relative to the company’s total OPEB obligation. Through June 30, 2021, a total of $581 million was contributed to employee pension plans (including $511 million to the U.S. plans). Total contributions for the full year are currently estimated to be $1.75 billion ($1.55 billion for the U.S. plans and $200 million for the international plans). Contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.During the first six months of 2021, the company contributed $79 million to its OPEB plans. The company anticipates contributing approximately $75 million during the remainder of 2021.

Note 8. Assets Held For Sale
At June 30, 2021, the company classified $1.36 billion of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2020 and the first six months of 2021 were not material.

Related income taxes for the same period, totaling $156 million, are reflected in “Income Tax Expense” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. All other reclassified amounts were insignificant.

Note 10. Income Taxes
The income tax expense increased between quarterly periods from a benefit of $2.32 billion in 2020 to a charge of $1.33 billion in 2021. The company's income before income tax expense increased $15.02 billion from a loss of $10.60 billion in 2020 to income of $4.42 billion in 2021, primarily due to the absence of second quarter 2020 impairments and write-offs, higher crude oil realizations and downstream margins, and an increase in production. The company’s effective tax rate changed between quarterly periods from 22 percent in 2020 to 30 percent in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate is mainly due to the consequence of the mix effects, resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and lower favorable international tax items.The income tax expense increased between the six-month periods from a benefit of $1.76 billion in 2020 to a charge of $2.11 billion in 2021. This increase is a direct result of the company’s income before income tax expense increasing $13.05 billion, from a loss of $6.45 billion in 2020 to income of $6.60 billion in 2021. The increase in income is primarily due to the absence of second quarter 2020 impairments and write-offs and higher crude oil realizations, partially offset by the absence of 2020 asset sale gains. The company’s effective tax rate changed between six-month periods from 27 percent in 2020 to 32 percent in 2021. The change in effective tax rate is primarily a consequence of the mix effects, resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and lower favorable international tax items. Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of June 30, 2021. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States — 2013, Nigeria — 2007, Australia — 2009, Kazakhstan — 2012 and Saudi Arabia — 2015.
15

Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcomes for these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments regarding tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.

Note 11. Litigation
MTBE
Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to six pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.
Ecuador
Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of an oil production consortium with Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador from 1967 until 1992. After termination of the consortium and a third-party environmental audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s remediation obligations. Following Texpet’s completion of a three-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In February 2011, that court entered a judgment against Chevron for approximately $9.5 billion plus additional punitive damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $9.5 billion. Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.In February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020.

Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
Management’s Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Chevron continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and that it does not provide any basis upon which an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or range of loss can be made.

Note 12. Other Contingencies and Commitments

Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 10 beginning on page 15 for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions.Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination.

Guarantees The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to guarantees, direct or indirect, of debt of affiliated companies or third parties. Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, the company would generally be required to perform should the affiliated company or third party fail to fulfill its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements may have recourse provisions that would enable the company to recover any payments made under the terms of the guarantees from assets provided as collateral.

Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200 million, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 million obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business.

Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining activities, whether operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to factors such as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which
17

Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or chemical companies.

Other Contingencies Governmental and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions, including without limitation injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels, that, while we believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.Seven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed 43 separate lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, decommission, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.

Note 13. Fair Value Measurements
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are described as follows:Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities.

The fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, is as follows:

Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at June 30, 2021.Derivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments — other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale — on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if applicable, are reflected in the table above. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, are as follows:Cash and Cash Equivalents The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less, and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $7.5 billion and $5.6 billion at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at June 30, 2021. Restricted Cash had a carrying/fair value of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. At June 30, 2021, restricted cash is classified as Level 1 and includes restricted funds related to certain upstream decommissioning activities and other corporate and tax items, which are reported in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-Term Debt had a net carrying value, excluding amounts reclassified from short-term debt, purchase price fair value adjustments and finance lease obligations, of $27.7 billion and $30.8 billion at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt for the company was $30.4 billion and $34.4 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds, classified as Level 1 and are $29.3 billion for the period. The fair value of other long-term debt classified as Level 2 is $1.1 billion. The carrying values of other short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, were not material.

Note 14. Financial and Derivative Instruments
The company’s commodity derivative instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. The company applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk associated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and other derivatives activities.The company uses commodity derivative instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements.
Derivative instruments measured at fair value at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows:

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”

Note 15. Revenue
“Sales and other operating revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income primarily arise from contracts with customers. Related receivables are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the current expected credit losses. The net balance of these receivables was $10.9 billion and $7.6 billion at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606.

Note 16. Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
Chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $699 million as of June 30, 2021 and $671 million as of December 31, 2020, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances. The majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $13.9 billion as of June 30, 2021, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default

and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days. Chevron's non-trade receivable balance was $3.1 billion as of June 30, 2021, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Equity affiliate loans are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of $560 million are included within Investments and Advances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Net income attributable to Chevron Corporation for second quarter 2021 was $3.08 billion ($1.60 per share — diluted), compared with a loss of $8.27 billion ($(4.44) per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2020 period. The net income attributable to Chevron Corporation for the first six months of 2021 was $4.46 billion ($2.32 per share — diluted), compared with a loss of $4.67 billion ($(2.51) per share — diluted) in the first six months of 2020. Upstream reported earnings of $3.18 billion in second quarter 2021 compared with a loss of $6.09 billion in the corresponding 2020 period. Earnings for the first six months of 2021 were $5.53 billion compared with a loss of $3.17 billion a year earlier. The increase for both periods was primarily due to the absence of second quarter 2020 impairments, write-offs, severance accruals and higher current quarter crude oil realizations, partially offset by the absence of 2020 asset sale gains and favorable tax items. Downstream reported earnings of $839 million in second quarter 2021 compared with a loss of $1.01 billion in the corresponding 2020 period primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher equity earnings from 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), and higher sales volumes. Earnings for the first six months of 2021 were $844 million compared with $93 million in the corresponding 2020 period. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem, higher sales volumes and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower margins on refined product sales.Refer to pages 28 through 30 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “All Other” activities for the second quarter and first six months 2021 versus the same periods in 2020.

Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron Corporation* is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Myanmar, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. _____________________* Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies generally owned 50 percent or less. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 23The company’s objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance. With ongoing global interest in addressing the risks of climate change, support for policies and advancements in lower carbon technologies is expected. In seeking to help advance a lower carbon future, Chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost efficiently, increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business, and investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions. In March 2021, the company announced its 2028 Upstream production greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity targets and its anticipated spending in advancing its energy transition strategy, as disclosed in the company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.Response to Market Conditions and COVID-19 The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a significant decrease in  demand for our products and created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace beginning late in the first quarter 2020. Though these conditions have improved in 2021, they continue to negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. While demand and commodity prices have largely recovered, demand is still not back to pre-pandemic levels, and financial results could continue to be challenged in future quarters. During the second quarter of 2021, the availability of vaccines around the world improved and business activity increased. Nevertheless, some countries face a resurgence of the virus and its variants that could impact logistics and materials movement and pose a risk to our business. We continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure to and spread of the COVID-19 virus in our operations through screening, testing and, when appropriate, quarantining personnel upon arrival to our operated facilities. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, progress continues on the Future Growth Project / Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP/WPMP) at TCO. Since April 2021, the project construction workforce at FGP/WPMP has continued to remobilize, and approximately 42,000 first vaccine doses have been administered and about 30,000 TCO personnel are fully vaccinated as part of the Republic of Kazakhstan's national vaccination program. Extended rotations, COVID-19 testing and isolation protocols are in place to minimize the spread of the virus.TCO recently reviewed the schedule and cost estimates for FGP/WPMP. Due to the impact of the pandemic, expected first oil dates are now mid-2023 for WPMP and late 2023 to mid-2024 for FGP. The cost target remains $45.2 billion, as cost reduction efforts as well as favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental costs associated with COVID-19. The contingency amount for the project spend has increased from $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion to recognize the schedule uncertainty associated with the virus and its variants.In 2021, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and coordinating countries’ (OPEC+) continued to curtail production.  However, such curtailments were not material in the second quarter.Demand for refined products, primarily jet fuel, has continued to be below pre-COVID-19 levels as a result of travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity implemented in many countries to combat the spread of COVID-19. Chevron continued to take steps to maximize diesel and motor gasoline production, given the decline in jet fuel demand, to align with the pace of global recovery. Chevron’s total refined product sales were up approximately 26 percent year-over-year in the second quarter 2021, but were down approximately 4 percent from the same period in 2019, primarily due to jet fuel sales. Refining crude utilization was approximately 85 percent in the second quarter 2021.Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” on pages 18 through 23 of the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.The company is actively managing its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals. Third party costs for capital, exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends.The spot markets for some commodities and raw materials have risen dramatically over the last six to nine months. A significant factor behind this trend may have been expectations ahead of the actual demand from the economic recovery.  Whether these input price increases are transitory or represent a new normal that will impact costs is critical to setting expectations for inflation. To date, the company has been shielded from these inflationary pressures by utilizing price mechanisms that alleviate impacts from some of this type of market volatility. As U.S. and international drilling activity continues to accelerate, continued upward market pressure is expected for oil and gas industry inputs (such as rigs, well services, etc.) Cost increases are likely to be correlated with rising rig counts by region. The pace of the economic recovery and shifting spending patterns may lead to more cross-industry competition for resources, which could impact the cost of certain non-oil and gas industry goods and services.

The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $42 per barrel for the full-year 2020. During the second quarter 2021, Brent averaged $69 per barrel and ended July at about $76. The WTI price averaged $39 per barrel for the full-year 2020. During the second quarter 2021, WTI averaged $66 per barrel and ended July at about $74. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. Crude prices have increased in the second quarter of 2021 driven by production curtailment by OPEC+ countries and steadily increasing demand for transportation fuels. (See page 34 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude oil sales prices).  However, in the July 2021 meeting, OPEC+ agreed to an increase in production quotas, which may result in lower crude oil prices.  In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply/demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.16 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the first six months of 2021, compared with $1.88 during the first six months of 2020. At the end of July 2021, the Henry Hub spot price was $4.03 per MCF. Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG assets is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $4.82 per MCF during the first six months of 2021, compared with $5.11 per MCF in the same period last year. (See page 34 for the company’s average natural gas sales prices for the U.S. and international regions.)The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2021 averaged 3.124 million barrels per day, essentially unchanged from first six months of 2020. About 27 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2021 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 28 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 29 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

U.S. upstream reported earnings of $1.45 billion in second quarter 2021, compared with a loss of $2.07 billion from a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to higher crude oil realizations of $1.75 billion and the absence of second quarter 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.19 billion and severance accruals of $120 million. Higher crude oil production of $440 million also contributed to the improvement between periods.U.S. upstream reported earnings of $2.39 billion for the first six months of 2021, compared with a loss of $1.83 billion from a year earlier. The increase was due to higher crude oil realizations of $2.17 billion, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.19 billion and higher crude oil production of $550 million.The average realization per barrel for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in second quarter 2021 was $54, compared with $19 a year earlier. The average realization per barrel for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in the first six months of 2021 was $51, compared with $29 a year earlier. The average natural gas realization in second quarter 2021 was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $0.81 in the 2020 period. The average natural gas realization in the first six months of 2021 was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $0.70 in the comparable 2020 period.Net oil-equivalent production of 1.14 million barrels per day in second quarter 2021 was up 145,000 barrels per day, or 15 percent, from a year earlier. The increase was due to an additional 227,000 barrels per day of production following the Noble Energy acquisition and lower production curtailments, partially offset by a 68,000 barrels per day decrease related to the Appalachian asset sale and lower production due to normal field declines. Net oil-equivalent production of 1.11 million barrels per day in the first six months of 2021 was up 79,000 barrels per day, or 8 percent, from a year earlier. The increase was due to an additional 218,000 barrels per day of production following the Noble Energy acquisition, partially offset by a 68,000 barrels per day decrease related to the Appalachian asset sale and lower production due to normal field declines. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 857,000 barrels per day in second quarter 2021 was up 15 percent from the corresponding 2020 period. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 829,000 barrels per day in the 2021 six-month period was up 7 percent from the 2020 period. Net natural gas production increased 15 percent to 1.68 billion cubic feet per day in second quarter 2021 from the 2020 comparative period.

International net oil-equivalent production of 1.99 million barrels per day in second quarter 2021 decreased 7,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2020 period. Higher production of an additional 148,000 barrels per day following the Noble Energy acquisition and lower production curtailments were more than offset by unfavorable entitlement effects and operational impacts. International net oil-equivalent production of 2.02 million barrels per day in the first six months of 2021 was down 66,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, from a year earlier. The decrease is due to unfavorable entitlement effects, operational impacts and normal field declines, partially offset by 143,000 barrels per day associated with the Noble Energy acquisition.The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 990,000 barrels per day in second quarter 2021 decreased 8 percent from the 2020 period. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 1.01 million barrels per day in the first six months of 2021 decreased 10 percent from the 2020 period. Net natural gas production of 5.99 billion cubic feet per day in second quarter 2021 increased 8 percent from the 2020 period. Net natural gas production of 6.06 billion cubic feet per day in the first six months of 2021 increased 5 percent from the 2020 period.

U.S. downstream reported earnings of $776 million in second quarter 2021, compared with a loss of $988 million a year earlier. The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales of $800 million, higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company of $480 million, higher sales volumes of $280 million, and lower operating expenses of $140 million, including the absence of second quarter 2020 severance accruals of $80 million.U.S. downstream reported earnings of $646 million for the first six months of 2021 compared with a loss of $538 million a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $490 million, higher margins on refined product sales of $250 million, higher sales volumes of $250 million, and lower operating expenses of $150 million, including the absence of second quarter severance accruals of $80 million.Refinery crude oil input in second quarter 2021 increased 65 percent to 956,000 barrels per day and for the first six months of 2021, crude oil input increased 19 percent to 918,000 barrels per day from the corresponding  2020 period. The increase for both comparative periods was due to the company's increased refinery runs in response to higher demand and the improved refining margin environment. Refined product sales in second quarter 2021 were up 40 percent to 1.16 million barrels per day and for the first  six months of 2021, refined product sales were up 11 percent to 1.11 million barrels per days from the corresponding 2020 period. The increase for both comparative periods was mainly due to higher gasoline and jet fuel demand as travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic eased.

The increase in income tax expense for the second quarter 2021 of $3.65 billion is consistent with the increase in total income before tax for the company of $15.02 billion. U.S. income before tax increased from a loss of $5.47 billion in second quarter 2020 to income of $1.68 billion in 2021. This $7.15 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher crude oil realizations, the absence of second quarter 2020 impairments and write-offs, higher downstream margins and an increase in production. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an  increase to tax expense of $1.61 billion between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $1.23 billion in 2020 to a charge of $381 million in 2021.International income before tax increased from a loss of $5.13 billion in second quarter 2020 to income of $2.74 billion in 2021. This $7.87 billion increase in income was primarily driven by the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs and higher crude oil realizations. The increased income and lower favorable international tax items drove the $2.04 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $1.09 billion in 2020 to a charge of $947 million in 2021. The company's increase in income tax expense for the first six months of 2021 of $3.87 billion was primarily due to the increase in the total before-tax income in 2021 of $13.05 billion. U.S. income before tax increased between the six-month periods, from a loss of $5.04 billion in 2020 to income of $1.58 billion in 2021. This increase in income was primarily driven by higher crude oil realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, increase in production and higher downstream margins. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an increase in tax expense of $1.49 billion between the six-month periods, from a benefit of $1.07 billion in 2020 to a charge of $415 million in 2021.International income before tax increased for the six-month periods, from a loss of $1.42 billion in 2020 to income of $5.02 billion in 2021. This increase in income was primarily driven by the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs and higher crude oil realizations, partially offset by the absence of 2020 asset sale gains. The increase in income and absence of various favorable international tax items primarily drove the $2.38 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from a benefit of $685 million in 2020 to a charge of $1.69 billion in 2021. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $7.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and $5.6 billion at year-end 2020. Cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2021 was $11.2 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in the year-ago period. Cash capital and exploratory expenditures totaled $3.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, down $1.7 billion from the year-ago period. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment totaled $352 million and $17 million, respectively, in the first six months of 2021, compared to $1.8 billion and $31 million, respectively, in the year-ago period. Dividends The company paid dividends of $5.0 billion to common stockholders during the first six months of 2021. In July 2021, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per common share, payable in September 2021.Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Chevron’s total debt and finance lease liabilities were $43.0 billion at June 30, 2021, down from $44.3 billion at December 31, 2020, as the company repaid long-term notes that matured during the second quarter and early retired long-term notes and the credit facility held by Noble Midstream Partners LP, which were partially offset by increased borrowings under its commercial paper program.The company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. The outstanding balance for the company’s commercial paper program at June 30, 2021 was $7.6 billion. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $13.3 billion at June 30, 2021, and $11.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Of these amounts, $9.825 billion was reclassified to long-term at both June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.At June 30, 2021, the company had $9.825 billion in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at June 30, 2021. In addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Texaco Capital Inc and Noble Energy, Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation (S&P) and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates, and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the flexibility to modify capital spending plans, discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program, sell assets, and increase borrowings to continue paying the common stock dividend. The company remains committed to retaining its high-quality debt ratings. Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries CUSA issued bonds that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together, the “Obligor Group”). The tables below contain summary financial information for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded.

Common Stock Repurchase Program On February 1, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. As of June 30, 2021, the company had purchased 48.6 million shares for $5.5 billion, resulting in $19.5 billion remaining under the authorized program. On March 24, 2020, the company announced the suspension of the stock repurchase program in response to market conditions. No shares were purchased under the program in the first half of 2021. On July 30, 2021, the company announced the resumption of purchases under the stock repurchase program in the third quarter 2021 at an expected rate of $2-3 billion per year.Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be discontinued or resumed at any time. Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $0.7 billion at June 30, 2021 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of all of the publicly held common units representing limited partner interests in Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron and its affiliates.  Included within noncontrolling interests is $127 million at June 30, 2021 and $120 million at December 31, 2020 of redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with Noble Midstream. There were distributions of $26 million to noncontrolling interests during the first six months of 2021 compared to $10 million for the same period in 2020.

The parties have negotiated a resolution of these issues with the agencies, which remains subject to approval by the U.S. District Court, District of Colorado. If approved by the court, resolution of these alleged violations will result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1,000,000.Other Proceedings Information related to legal proceedings, including Ecuador, is included beginning on page 16 in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

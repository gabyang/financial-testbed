Tesla Motors, Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1. Overview of the Company Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design,
develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to
market and/or service our vehicles. Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately $660.6
million of cash in operations through March 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2013, we had $214.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, cash held in our dedicated
Department of Energy (DOE) account, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity, based on our current plans. These capital sources will enable us to fund our
ongoing operations, continue research and development projects and establish and expand our stores, service centers and Supercharger network. Restatement of Prior Year Amounts We have restated the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Amounts related to purchases of property and equipment during the period that
were not paid as of March 31, 2012 were erroneously included as cash outflows from investing activities in our previously issued financial statements. This correction resulted in a $13.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment
included in cash flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase in the change in accounts payable resulting in an increase in cash flows used in operating activities. We have also corrected our supplemental disclosure of noncash
acquisition of property and equipment by an increase of $27.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. There was no impact on previously reported total cash and cash equivalents, condensed consolidated balance sheet or condensed
consolidated statement of operations. As detailed in the table below, the restatement impacted the following condensed
consolidated cash flow line items (in thousands):

Public Offering On September 25, 2012, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 relating to a public offering of common stock. On October 3, 2012, we completed the offering and sold a total of 7,964,601
shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of $222.1 million (which includes 35,398 shares or $1.0 million sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and cofounder), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation,
warranties, fair value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, the
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 and the condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 and other information disclosed in the related notes are unaudited. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 was derived
from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the
annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The
condensed consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period. Revenue Recognition We
recognize revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle and greenhouse gas emission credits, as well as sales of
electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding
customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Warranties We began recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a warranty of three
years or 36,000 miles, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Tesla Roadster customers had the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. In June 2012, we commenced deliveries of Model S. Model S is sold with a warranty of four
years or 50,000 miles for most vehicle components and covers the battery pack for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicles battery, although the battery packs charging capacity is
not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):

We provide a warranty on all vehicle, production powertrain components and systems sales, and we accrue
warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or production powertrain component is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves include managements best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on
actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. For new vehicles, warranty reserves are based on managements best estimate of projected warranty experience until
adequate historical data is accumulated. We may have material changes as we accumulate more data and experience. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and
we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from the
balance sheet date is classified as current, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents
are primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not required for use in operations in high
credit quality securities based on our investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and limits regarding credit quality, investment concentration, investment type, and maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing
risk of loss of capital. Investments are of a short-term nature and include investments in corporate debt securities. As of
March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from the development and sales of powertrain systems as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automobile manufacturers. The following summarizes the accounts receivable in excess of 10% of our total accounts receivable:

Supply Risk Although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements
on a timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potential dilutive shares of
our common stock resulting from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and equivalents are determined under the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and
diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except share and per share data);

Construction in progress is comprised primarily of assets related to the manufacturing of our Model S,
including tooling and manufacturing equipment and capitalized interest expense. Depreciation of these assets begins when they are ready for their intended use. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant
capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the life of the related assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, we
capitalized $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense during the three months ended
March 31, 2013 and 2012 was $17.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Other Assets As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, our other assets consisted of the following (in thousands):

4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which
there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents. Our liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of our common stock warrant liability. All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level
I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our common stock warrant liability (see Note 6) is classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and financial liabilities that
are carried at fair value was as follows (in thousands):

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on a market approach was approximately $369.9
million (par value of $439.6 million) and $366.9 million (par value of $452.3 million) as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, and represent Level II valuations. When determining the estimated fair value of our long-term
debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk. 5. Customer Deposits Customer deposits consist of payments that allow potential customers to make an advance payment for the future purchase
of a Model S, Model X or Tesla Roadster. These amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle is delivered. We require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Amounts
received by us as customer deposits are generally not restricted as to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the related customer deposits are applied against the customers total purchase price for the vehicle and recognized in
automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle sale. Historically, we have referred to such customer deposits as
reservation payments and these initial reservation payments have been fully refundable until such time that the customer selected the vehicle specifications and entered into a purchase agreement. We recently eliminated the reservation process for
Model S in North America as vehicle production became more reliable and customer wait times decreased. Customers now initiate their purchase by ordering their customized Model S rather than placing a generic reservation in queue. As a result of this
transition away from reservations, we have renamed the reservation payments caption on our condensed consolidated financial statements to customer deposits. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we held customer deposits of $130.7 million and $138.8 million, respectively.
6. Department of Energy Loan Facility On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant
to the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program. This loan facility was amended in June 2011 to expand our cash investment options, in February 2012 to modify the timing of certain future financial covenants and funding of
the debt service reserve account, and in June and December 2012 to allow us to effect certain initiatives in our business plan. In September 2012, we entered into an amendment with the DOE to remove our obligation to comply with the current ratio
financial covenant as of September 30, 2012 and amend the timing of pre-funding the principal payment due in June 2013. We entered into another amendment with the DOE in March 2013 that, 
among other things, modified certain future financial covenants, accelerated the maturity date of the DOE Loan Facility to December 15, 2017, created an obligation to repay approximately
1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before June 15, 2013, and created additional contingent obligations based on excess cash flows that may result in accelerated repayment of the DOE Loan Facility starting in
2015. The original amortization schedule for the DOE Loan Facility is not affected by this recent amendment, and so the debt service payments remain the same until the new maturity date when all outstanding loans under the DOE Loan Facility are to
be repaid. We refer to the loan facility with the DOE, as amended, as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, the FFB has made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0 million. As of
August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down the aforementioned facilities. All outstanding amounts under the DOE Loan
Facility are repayable in quarterly installments, which commenced on December 15, 2012 and will be due on the maturity date of December 15, 2017. All obligations under the DOE Loan Facility are secured by substantially all of our property.
The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the projects be
conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter
into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of
business, and enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current
liabilities, and (i) a limit on capital expenditures, (ii) from December 31, 2013, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and (iii) from March 31, 2014, a maximum
ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity. We were in compliance with our current applicable financial covenants as of March 31, 2013. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary events of default, subject in some cases to
customary cure periods for certain defaults. In addition, events of default include a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we
complete the project relating to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock held by Mr. Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility. As part of the most recent amendment to the DOE Loan Facility in March
2013, we agreed to, among other things, (i) make an early payment of approximately 1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before June 15, 2013, (ii) make additional quarterly prepayments equal to: 20% of
our excess cash flow for each quarter of fiscal 2015; and 35% of our excess cash flow for each quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2017. Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have agreed to pre-fund a dedicated debt service reserve account with our planned loan repayments as
required by the DOE loan facility. As of March 31, 2013, $14.8 million was held in this dedicated account, an amount equal to all principal and interest that will come due on June 15, 2013. In addition, we have agreed to make additional
payments, beginning June 15, 2013, of between $14.2 million to $14.5 million each quarter to pre-fund the quarterly principal and interest payments that will be due from September 15, 2013 through December 15, 2014. Once we have
deposited such amounts, we will not be required to further pre-fund such debt service reserve account. We have classified this cash as current restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. DOE Warrant In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price
of 
$2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$7.54 per share. The original provisions of the warrant provided that beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant would vest and become exercisable in quarterly amounts
depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. If and to the extent vested, the warrant may be exercisable until December 15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part or in full prior to the warrant
vesting periods, the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced. As part of the most recent
amendment to the DOE Loan Facility in March 2013, we agreed to repay all outstanding principal and interest payments under the DOE Loan Facility by December 15, 2017 prior to the warrant vesting start date of December 15, 2018; therefore,
the DOE warrant is no longer expected to vest and its fair value has been reduced to zero. In prior periods, since the number
of shares ultimately issuable under the warrants would vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest
rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates, we had historically measured the fair value of the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions to be made between
prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE warrant. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then be calculated as the average
warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date. The prepayment feature which allows us to prepay the DOE Loan Facility, and consequently affect the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrant, was
determined to represent an embedded derivative. This embedded derivative was inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the fair value of the embedded derivative are
reflected as part of the warrant liability re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet reporting date. The warrant is
recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. The fair value of the warrant at issuance was $6.3 million, and along with the DOE Loan Facility fee of
$0.5 million and other debt issuance costs of $0.9 million, represents a cost of closing the loan facility and is being amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the DOE Loan Facility. During each of the three months ended
March 31, 2013 and 2012, we amortized $0.2 million to interest expense. The DOE warrant will continue to be recorded at
its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense, net, as the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting. As part of the most recent amendment
to the DOE Loan Facility in March 2013, we agreed to repay all outstanding principal and interest payments under the DOE Loan Facility prior to the warrant vesting date; therefore, the DOE warrant is no longer expected to vest. As of March 31,
2013, the fair value of the DOE warrant was zero. As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of the DOE warrant was $10.7 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized other income for the change in the fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $10.7 million and $0.2 million,
respectively. 7. Equity Incentive Plans We account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing the fair value of all stock-based payment awards
made to employees based on the estimated grant date fair values, including 
employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of employee stock options which requires a number of assumptions
to determine the model inputs. These include the expected volatility of the stocks market price, the expected term of the stock-based awards, the expected risk free rate of interest and any dividend yields. As stock-based compensation expense
is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. As we have been
operating as a public company for a period of time that is shorter than our estimated expected option life, we concluded that our historical price volatility does not provide a reasonable basis for input assumptions within the Black-Scholes
valuation model when determining the fair value of its stock options. As a result, our expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies. The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations
(in thousands):

9. Strategic Partnerships Daimler Mercedes-Benz EV Program During the fourth quarter of 2011, Daimler engaged us to assist with the development of a
full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. In 2012, we received two purchase orders from Daimler to begin development work and also entered into a separate development agreement. Pursuant to the development agreement,
Daimler will pay us up to $33.2 million for the successful completion of certain at risk development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we completed a milestone, delivered prototype
samples and recognized $6.5 million in development services revenue related to the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. Toyota RAV4 Program In July 2011, we entered into a supply and services agreement with Toyota for the supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery pack, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and
associated software for integration into the electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Additionally, we provide Toyota with certain services related to the supply of the electric powertrain system. During the three months ended March 31,
2012, we began delivering electric powertrain systems to Toyota. During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized revenue of $14.4 million and $0.3 million in automotive sales, respectively. In October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of the electric powertrain system
for the Toyota RAV4 electric vehicle. Toyota paid $60.1 million for the successful completion of certain at risk development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples, including a $5.0 million upfront payment that we received upon the
execution of the agreement. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we completed various milestones and along with the amortization of our upfront payment and the delivery of certain prototype samples, we recognized $10.7 million in
development services revenue. As of March 31, 2012, all development milestones under the Phase 1 agreement had been completed; therefore, no further development services revenue under the Phase 1 agreement have been recorded subsequently.
10. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Liabilities In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously
identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts to address these conditions. These conditions are now being addressed by us and NUMMI. Although we have been
advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on such environmental issues at the time we purchased the facility, we cannot determine the potential costs to remediate
any pre-existing contamination with any certainty. Based on managements best estimate, we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities was determined based on
an expected value analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMIs facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As
we continue with our construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the
first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and NUMMI has agreed
to pay the next $15.0 million for such remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our
reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or
whenever $30.0 million has been spent on the remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMIs liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont
site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMIs obligations for representations and warranties under the
agreement. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we have accrued $5.3 million related to these environmental liabilities. Other Commitments and Contingencies From time to time, we are
subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of
communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
Overview and Quarter Highlights We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We
introduced our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. The Roadsters proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our powertrain technology and, with design enhancements, forms the basis for our Model S sedan,
our Model X crossover and other future vehicles. We are targeting our second vehicle, Model S, for a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster and are manufacturing Model S in significantly higher volumes than those for the Tesla
Roadster. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and increased production to an annualized rate of 20,000 per year by the end of 2012. In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover, a vehicle based on the
Model S platform. We plan to start Model X production in late 2014. We sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we recognized total revenues of $561.8 million, an increase of $531.6 million over total revenues of $30.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2012. Automotive sales revenue of $555.2 million increased $536.0 million from the three months ended March 31, 2012, primarily driven by Model S deliveries in North America which commenced in June 2012, regulatory credit sales
and powertrain component sales to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV. Development services revenue decreased to $6.6 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2013 from $10.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, due primarily to the completion of our development activities for the Toyota RAV4 EV program during the first quarter of 2012,
partially offset by the start of our development work on a full electric powertrain under the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. During the first quarter of 2013, we recognized development services revenue for the achievement of a development
milestone and from the delivery of prototype samples to Daimler under this program. Gross margin for the three months ended
March 31, 2013 was 17.1%, an increase from 8% for the three months ended December 31, 2012, reflecting Model S production of over 5,000 vehicles during the quarter, manufacturing efficiencies, part cost reductions and sales of regulatory
credits. We delivered approximately 4,900 Model S vehicles during the three months ended March 31, 2013. Research and
development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $54.9 million, a decrease from $68.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2012 included expenses related
to our Model S pre-production activities, including manufacturing preparedness, process validation, prototype builds and extensive testing at both the vehicle and component levels; development of the Tesla Factory and development and testing of
Model S. As the Model S production in the Tesla Factory became fully operational in the second half of 2012, Model S related manufacturing costs, including direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead and amortized tooling, and
logistics, were no longer recorded as R&D expenses but instead were fully reflected in cost of automotive sales. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2013 include continuing activities to homologate Model S for the rest of the world and
ongoing research and development activities related to Model S, supercharging and other programs. During the three months
ended March 31, 2013, we continued to expand our company-owned network of stores, service centers and Superchargers, primarily in the United States. With the higher 
expenses associated with the expansion of our store network and service infrastructure, selling, general and administrative expenses were $47.0 million for the three months ended March 31,
2013, compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. We ended the quarter with $231.1 million in
cash and cash equivalents, and current restricted cash. Through cash received from our revenue generating activities as well as careful working capital management, such as the reduction of inventories on-hand, we generated positive free cash flow
(cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) of $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. During
the three months ended March 31, 2013, we made our second quarterly payment under our Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Facility, as scheduled. We also set aside $14.6 million for our third quarterly DOE payment, which is due in June 2013 and is
classified in current restricted cash. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment of our DOE Loan Facility. This
amendment, among other things, modified certain future financial covenants, accelerated the maturity date of the DOE Loan Facility to December 15, 2017, created an obligation to repay approximately 1.0% of the outstanding principal under the
DOE Loan Facility on or before June 15, 2013, and created additional contingent obligations based on excess cash flows that may result in accelerated repayment of the DOE Loan Facility starting in 2015. Since we agreed to repay all outstanding
principal and interest payments under the DOE Loan Facility by December 15, 2017, the DOE warrant is no longer expected to vest. As a result, we eliminated our common stock warrant liability and reflected $10.7 million of other income in other
income, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2013. For more information, see Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will
continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. However, if market conditions are favorable, we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks In 2012, we completed the development of Model S, established our manufacturing capabilities at the Tesla Factory, launched Model S and ramped up our production rate. By the end of 2012, we had
successfully increased production volume to over 400 vehicles per week and we have continued to consistently produce at or above this rate during the first quarter of 2013. We expect that this production level will allow us to achieve our goal of
21,000 Model S deliveries worldwide in 2013 and thereby significantly increase automotive sales, as compared to 2012. In our
efforts to make Model S available to a wider range of customers, we commenced delivery of cars equipped with the lower priced, 60 kWh battery pack during the first quarter of 2013. At the same time, due to lower than expected demand for Model S with
the 40 kWh battery pack, we announced that the 40 kWh battery pack would not be produced. Since some customers had already configured their vehicles with the 40 kWh battery pack, we offered to deliver a vehicle with a 60 kWh battery pack that would
be limited to 40 kWh by on-board firmware. We have delivered over 7,500 Model S vehicles solely to customers in North
America. We plan to start European deliveries of the Model S this summer and Asian deliveries later in 2013. Although we have made enhancements to our delivery process in North America and will continue to do so, we have not delivered Model S
vehicles outside of North America and thus may face difficulties meeting our 
delivery plans in both Europe and Asia. If we are unable to ramp up deliveries in Europe and Asia and sustain a high level of weekly Model S deliveries throughout the year, our revenues and
operating results could be significantly adversely affected and it would be unlikely that we would achieve our goal of 21,000 Model S deliveries worldwide in 2013. In April 2013, we announced a financing plan whereby customers could conveniently obtain financing through one of our partner banks and also receive a residual value guarantee from Tesla. We believe that
through this arrangement, customers will be able to realize some of the same benefits as those from a traditional lease. As a result of the residual value guarantee, we expect to apply lease accounting to these sales which would defer the
recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at delivery. Although lease accounting will not impact our cash flows and liquidity, a significant uptake under this program could adversely impact our 2013 revenues and
operating results. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles residual value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher
than our estimates. In addition to sales of Model S, we will continue to recognize automotive sales from our supply of
powertrain systems to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV. However, Toyota is not obligated to continue to purchase powertrain systems from us over an extended period of time. In 2012, we began work on a full electric powertrain under the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. Under this program, we will continue to provide development services and deliver prototype samples in 2013.
Similar to our previous development services agreements, due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of milestone revenues and the underlying costs of development services, the gross margin from our development services
activities may vary from period to period. Additionally, we continue to negotiate an agreement to supply Daimler with production parts for the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV. During the first quarter of 2013, production efficiency on a per vehicle basis improved substantially as we continued to stabilize and improve our production processes. We also benefited from part cost
reductions and labor and overhead costs being allocated over higher production volume. We expect these trends to continue as we execute on our roadmap of achieving component cost reductions as well as realizing manufacturing and logistics
efficiencies. As a result, we expect to achieve gross margin in the high teens in the second quarter of 2013. This expectation includes the impact from lower zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credit sales, a lower average selling price due to a higher mix
of 60 kWh Model S vehicles, as well as limited sales of the now discontinued 40 kWh vehicles, which will have a range-limited 60 kWh battery pack. We expect our gross margin to continue to rise to our target of 25% in the fourth
quarter of 2013, which assumes no ZEV credit revenue. We may not be able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives, which would negatively affect our ability to reach our gross margin
goals. During the first quarter of 2013, we recognized $67.9 million in ZEV sales, which contributed to our gross margin. ZEV
credit revenue should decline in future quarters relative to our automotive sales as we grow our sales outside the United States and earn fewer credits on the 60 kWh Model S battery variant for those sales that occur in the United States. Other
regulatory credit sales recognized during the first quarter of 2013 were $17.1 million. While we will pursue opportunities to monetize ZEV credits we earn from the sales of our vehicles, we do not plan to rely on these sales to be a significant
contributor to gross margin, and our business model is not predicated on such ZEV credits. In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first
vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We currently plan to start production of Model X in late 2014. Our ability to develop and introduce the Model X in this timeframe is based partially on our expectations of leveraging
the Model S platform. If there is a lower level of commonality between Model S and Model X than anticipated, our future development and tooling costs may exceed expectations which could delay our Model X production ramp. During the first quarter of 2013, we continued to expand our stores and significantly expand our service infrastructure. As of the end of
the quarter, we had 34 stores and galleries around the world, and plan to open about 15 more stores and galleries in 2013, with about half the openings in Europe and Asia to support our expansion into these regions during the second half of 2013. To
keep pace with the growing fleet of customer cars, we remain on plan to add approximately 30 service locations around the world in 2013 to our current network of 41 service centers. During the first quarter, significant progress in planning was made
to accelerate the deployment of our Supercharger network in the United States. Going forward, we plan to increase the number of Supercharger installations. We may experience difficulties in finding suitable sites, negotiating leases or obtaining
required permits for such locations, and our planned expansion of such Superchargers could be delayed or stalled. We plan to
transition away from collecting reservations in markets where production has been fully implemented. In this vein, we recently began modifying our sales processes to simplify and enhance the customer pre-delivery experience. As Model S production
and deliveries became more reliable during the first quarter, we realized that the reservation process was cumbersome and therefore recently eliminated it for Model S in North America. Customers in North America now initiate their purchase by
ordering their customized Model S online in a simple three step process, rather than placing a generic reservation in queue. In markets where full production and delivery rates for Model S have not yet been reached, and for Model X, the
reservation process will continue. As a result of this transition away from reservations, we have renamed the reservation payments caption on our condensed consolidated financial statements to customer deposits. We are currently receiving orders at a rate greater than 20,000 cars per year worldwide. Notably, the orders we are receiving are mainly
for deliveries in the United States and have only recently begun to accept orders from Europe. We expect that the number of international orders will increase when we enter the European and Asian markets. Despite changes that we have made
de-emphasizing reservations, new monthly reservations received in the first quarter of 2013 were higher than our recent nine-month historical monthly average. Cancellations remained elevated as the price increase started to impact older reservation
holders and as some of the opportunistic reservations we received at the end of 2012 reversed during the first quarter of 2013. The new streamlined ordering process has resulted in lower cancellations. In 2013, we plan to spend approximately $200 million in capital expenditures as we conclude the majority of our investment in the Tesla
Factory and Model S tooling. This reduction will be partially offset by expenditures related to expanding our service, store and Supercharger network as well as new product development. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing
basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2012, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the periods presented (in thousands):

Table of Contents
Automotive sales during the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $555.2 million, an
increase from $19.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Vehicle, options and related sales represent sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service and
sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units, to other manufacturers.
Vehicle, options and related sales during the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $540.8 million, an increase from
$17.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. The increase in vehicle, options and related sales was primarily driven by Model S deliveries which commenced in June 2012, higher sales of regulatory credits including $67.9 million in
zero emission credit sales, as well as powertrain component sales to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV, partially offset by a decrease in sales of the Tesla Roadster as we completed production of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012 and limited inventory
remains for sale, primarily in Europe and Asia. Powertrain component and related sales for the three months ended
March 31, 2013 were $14.4 million, an increase from $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we delivered only a limited number of powertrain components to Daimler as the
production for both the Daimler Smart fortwo and A-Class EV programs was substantially completed as of December 31, 2011 and the sales of powertrain systems to Toyota under the RAV4 EV supply and services agreement commenced in March 2012.
Powertrain component and related sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were related to powertrain component sales to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV. Development Services Development services represent arrangements where we
develop electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automobile manufacturers, including the design and development of battery packs, drive units and chargers to meet customers specifications. Development services revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $6.6 million, a decrease from $10.9 million during the
three months ended March 31, 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into a development agreement with
Daimler to assist with the development of a full electric powertrain for a Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we recognized development services revenue of $6.5 million for the achievement of a
milestone and from the delivery of prototype samples to Daimler under this program. In October 2010, we entered into a Phase
1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which would be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the
Toyota RAV4. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we completed our remaining milestones and delivered samples under the Phase 1 agreement and recognized $10.7 million of revenue. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services. Cost of automotive sales during the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $461.8 million, an increase from $13.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Cost of automotive sales
includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, 
royalty fees, shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the
carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. The increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by the commencement of
Model S deliveries in June 2012 as well as electric powertrain component and systems sales to Toyota as we began to deliver under the Toyota RAV4 EV supply and services agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the number of Roadster deliveries
and battery packs and chargers delivered to Daimler. Cost of development services during the three months ended
March 31, 2013 was $3.7 million, a decrease from $6.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Cost of development services includes engineering support and testing, direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead,
including amortized tooling costs, shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements. The decrease in cost of development services was driven primarily by our
development activities for the Toyota RAV4 EV program which we substantially completed during the three months ended March 31, 2012, partially offset by costs associated with development activities related to the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV
program which we commenced in 2012. Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $96.3 million, an
increase from $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This increase was driven primarily by the commencement of Model S deliveries and the sales of regulatory credits, which carry no associated cost of revenues, partially
offset by lower sales of the Tesla Roadster. We expect our development services gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate
in future periods as the timing of revenue recognition may not coincide with the period in which the corresponding cost of revenues is recognized. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses
consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment
expense. Overhead costs related to the Tesla Factory prior to the start of production of Model S are also included in research and development expenses. Also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur,
if any, prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured. Development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in
cost of revenues. Research and development expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $54.9 million, a
decrease from $68.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The $13.5 million decrease in research and development expenses consisted primarily of a $12.0 million decrease in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to
support our Model S release candidate builds and crash testing in 2012, a $3.7 million decrease in costs related to Model S engineering, design and testing activities, a $1.9 million decrease in office, information technology and
facilities-related costs and a $1.3 million decrease in shipping charges for prototype materials. The decrease was partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in employee compensation expenses from higher headcount and a $1.8 million increase
in stock-based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants. We anticipate that our research and development expenses in the remainder of 2013 will
increase slightly as compared to the first quarter of 2013. In addition, future equity awards may result in an increase in research and development expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our Tesla stores, marketing,
sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $47.0 million, an increase from $30.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The
$16.4 million increase in our selling, general and administrative consisted primarily of a $7.2 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and
higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business, a $5.7 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business, a $2.6 million increase in
professional and outside services costs and a $0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation
applied to new grants. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase moderately for the remainder of
2013 as we continue to increase our vehicle selling and servicing capabilities. In addition, future equity awards may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest Expense Our interest expense is incurred primarily from
our loans under the DOE Loan Facility to fund our Model S and powertrain activities, and as of August 2012, we had fully drawn down on the DOE Loan Facility. We have historically capitalized this interest to construction in progress. During the
three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, we capitalized $2.1 million and $1.6 million of interest expense to construction in progress, respectively. As our construction activities decrease over time, we expect to capitalize less interest
expense in future periods. Consequently, we expect interest expense to increase during the remainder of 2013. Other Income (Expense),
Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our DOE common stock warrant
liability and foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. The DOE warrant
is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. Other income, net, during the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $17.1 million, an increase in income compared to other expense, net, of $1.1 million during the three months ended March 31,
2012. The increase in other income, net, was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2013. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment
to the DOE Loan Facility which, among other things, accelerated the maturity date of our DOE loans to December 15, 2017; therefore, the DOE warrant is no longer expected to vest. The increase in other income was also attributable to a favorable
foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated liabilities, especially related to the Japanese yen. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes during the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $0.2 million compared to $0.1 million during the
three months ended March 31, 2012. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception and through
March 31, 2013, we had accumulated net operating losses of $1.05 billion and have used $660.6 million of cash in operations. As of March 31, 2013, we had $231.1 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and
cash equivalents in the amount of $214.4 million which included investments in money market funds, and cash of $14.8 million deposited in a dedicated DOE account in accordance with the requirements of our DOE Loan Facility to pre-fund our
quarterly DOE loan repayment of principal and interest that will come due on June 15, 2013. Other sources of cash
include cash from the sales of Model S, customer deposits for Model S and Model X, sales of regulatory credits, cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems. We expect that our current sources of
liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, cash held in our dedicated DOE account, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. These
capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover, establish and expand our stores, service centers and Supercharger network and to make the
investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X. If market conditions are favorable, we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. Also, should prevailing economic conditions and/or financial, business or other factors adversely affect the estimates of our future cash
requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements through additional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. DOE Loan Facility On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the ATVM Incentive Program. We refer to the loan facility with the DOE, as
amended, as the DOE Loan Facility. The DOE Loan Facility requires, among other things, that we comply with certain financial covenants and fund a debt service account. The financial covenants include a minimum current ratio, which is a ratio of our
current assets to our current liabilities (taking into account certain categorical exclusions); a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which is a ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated fixed charges; and a maximum ratio of total
liabilities to stockholder equity. The DOE Loan Facility was amended in June 2011 to expand our cash investment options, in February 2012 to modify the timing of certain future financial covenants and funding of the debt service reserve account, in
June and December 2012 to allow us to effect certain initiatives in our business plan. In September 2012, we entered into an amendment with the DOE that: (i) removed our obligation to comply with the current ratio financial covenant for the
third quarter of 2012; (ii) amended our funding requirements for the dedicated debt service reserve account to (a) postpone until February 15, 2013, $14.6 million of the $28.8 million pre-funding payment originally due on
October 15, 2012; and (b) make additional pre-funding payments, beginning June 15, 2013, of between $14.2 million to $14.5 million each quarter to pre-fund the quarterly principal and interest payments due from September 15,
2013 through December 15, 2014; and (iii) added a covenant requiring us to work in good faith with the DOE to develop an early repayment plan for our outstanding DOE Loan Facility on terms satisfactory to the DOE. We entered into another
amendment with the DOE in March 2013 that, among other things: (i) modified certain future financial covenants; (ii) accelerated the maturity date of the DOE 
Loan Facility to December 15, 2017; (iii) created an obligation to repay approximately 1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before June 15, 2013; and
(iv) created additional contingent obligations based on excess cash flow that may result in accelerated repayment of the DOE Loan Facility starting in 2015. The original amortization schedule for the DOE Loan Facility is not affected by this
recent amendment, and so the debt service payments remain the same until the new maturity date when all outstanding loans under the DOE Loan Facility are to be repaid. In February 2013, we pre-funded $14.6 million for all principal and interest that will come due on June 15, 2013 into a dedicated debt service reserve account in accordance with the pre-funding
requirement under the DOE Loan Facility. For more information on the DOE Loan Facility, see Note 6 to our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Summary of

We have restated the unaudited statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2012.
Amounts related to purchases of property and equipment during the period that were not paid as of March 31, 2012 were erroneously included as cash outflows from investing activities in our previously issued financial statements. This correction
resulted in a $13.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment included in cash flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase in the change in accounts payable resulting in an increase in cash flows used in operating
activities. There was no impact on our previously reported total cash and cash equivalents, condensed consolidated balance sheet or condensed consolidated statement of operations. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and
administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $64.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2013 net of adjustments for
non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization of $17.9 million, non-cash charges of $14.9 million related to stock-based compensation expense, and inventory write-downs of $1.5 million, partially offset by other income associated with
the reduction in fair value of the DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million. Significant operating cash inflows were comprised primarily of automotive sales of $555.2 million, an $18.2 million decrease in inventory and operating
lease vehicles, $6.6 million of development services revenue and a $4.1 million net increase in deferred revenue associated with various vehicle service plans introduced in March 2013. Significant operating cash outflows for the three months
ended March 31, 2013 were primarily related to $465.5 million of cost of revenues, $101.9 million of operating expenses, a $26.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of vendor
payments, an $8.1 million net decrease in customer deposits as a result of the sales of Model S and a $2.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net cash used in operating activities was $63.3 million during the three months ended
March 31, 2012. The largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of $89.9 million, which included non-cash charges of $10.7 million related to stock-based compensation expense, $4.2 million related to
depreciation and amortization and $2.6 million related to inventory write-downs and adverse purchase commitments. Significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to $99.0 million of operating expenses, $20.0 million of cost of
revenues and a $5.6 million increase in inventory and operating lease vehicles, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a $2.5 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current
assets. Inventory increased to meet our planned production requirements for the Model S and powertrain component sales while the net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business and the timing of
vendor payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily driven by various tax refunds received during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Significant operating cash inflows for the three months ended
March 31, 2012 were comprised primarily of automotive sales of $19.2 million, $10.9 million of development services revenue and a $21.6 million net increase in customer deposits, partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in accounts
receivable. The increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to receivables from Toyota for the achievement of our final milestones under the Toyota RAV4 EV Phase 1 contract services agreement. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including investments in Model S manufacturing, as well as restricted cash that we must
maintain in relation to our DOE Loan Facility, facility lease agreements, equipment financing, and certain vendor credit policies. We currently expect our capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately $200 million, as we have concluded the
majority of our investment in the Tesla Factory and Model S tooling. This reduction will be partially offset by expenditures related to the expansion of our service, store and Supercharger network, investing in new capital equipment and tooling to
reduce variable costs and new product development. Net cash used in investing activities was $55.2 million during the three
months ended March 31, 2013 primarily related to $57.7 million in purchases of capital equipment and tooling, partially offset by a $2.6 million net decrease in restricted cash. Net cash used in investing activities was $66.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012 primarily related to $54.8
million in purchases of capital equipment and a net transfer of $11.0 million into our dedicated DOE accounts in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. The increase in capital purchases was primarily due to significant continuing
development and construction activities at the Tesla Factory as well as purchases of manufacturing equipment. Cash
Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.7 million during the three months
ended March 31, 2013 and was comprised primarily of $17.9 million received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $12.7 million related
to our planned quarterly repayment of loan principal under the DOE Loan Facility, and $1.5 million related to principal payments on our capital leases. Net cash provided by financing activities was $92.8 million during the three months ended
March 31, 2012 and was comprised primarily of $84.3 million received from our draw-downs under the DOE Loan Facility and $9.0 million received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and the purchase of common stock under our
employee stock purchase plan. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Risk Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign
currencies are not completely matched. For example, a portion of our costs and expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2013 was denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, euro and British pound. Conversely, for this
period and until such time as we begin shipping significant quantities of Model S vehicles to foreign jurisdictions, we expect that a significant majority of our revenues will be denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S.
dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected.
In the future, and as we begin selling Model S overseas, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in which case a strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result
of a favorable foreign currency exchange impact from foreign currency-denominated liabilities, especially related to the Japanese yen, we recorded gains on foreign exchange transactions in other income (expense), net, for the three months ended
March 31, 2013. Interest Rate Risk We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $214.4 million as of March 31, 2013. A portion of our cash and cash equivalents was
invested in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value
as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2013, we
had loans under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate of $439.6 million and capital lease obligations of $15.9 million, all of which are fixed rate instruments. Therefore, our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in
interest rates.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management, with the
participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2013. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information 
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2013, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as a result of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, as previously disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2013. Previously Reported Material Weakness Our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2012 because a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the presentation and disclosure of non-cash capital expenditures
in our consolidated statements of cash flows. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we did not design effective controls to determine and review the total unpaid amounts related to capital expenditures that should have been excluded
from operating and investing activities in the cash flow statement and disclosed as non-cash items. In response to the material weakness in internal controls described above, during the three months ended March 31, 2013, we began to include as
part of our financial reporting review process, the determination of total unpaid amounts related to capital expenditures that should be excluded from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosed as non-cash items.
Though management is still evaluating the design of these new procedures, we believe that our improved processes and procedures will assist in the remediation of the material weakness. Once placed in operation for a sufficient period of time, we
will subject these procedures to appropriate tests, in order to determine whether they are operating effectively. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters
and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
You
should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks
facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We may be unable to sustain our current level of production or deliveries of Model S, both of which could harm our business and prospects. We began manufacturing and delivering Model S in June 2012. We have very limited experience to date in high volume manufacturing of our
electric vehicles as we only recently reached full production of Model S for the U.S. market and will begin production of Model S for the European market shortly. Our ability to maintain high volume Model S production will depend upon a number of
factors, including our suppliers ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner, our ability to use our manufacturing processes as planned for volume production while maintaining our desired quality levels and efficiently making
design changes to ensure consistently high quality. The Model S is an all new vehicle which we are producing with new employees using new equipment and therefore our production processes are still maturing. To produce a vehicle that meets our
quality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and
quality levels to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints. Any disruption
in maintaining our production level of Model S could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have only recently increased our Model S delivery rates in the United States to match our current and anticipated Model S production capacity. We have very limited experience in the high volume
delivery of our Model S vehicles as we have recently reached our steady state production rate of 400 vehicles produced per week. Furthermore, we plan to start European deliveries of the Model S this summer and Asian deliveries later in 2013, but
have limited experience delivering vehicles outside of the United States and thus may face difficulties meeting our delivery plans in both Europe and Asia. If we are unable to maintain our weekly delivery rate to match our steady state production
rate of Model S, ramp up deliveries in Europe and Asia and sustain a high level of weekly Model S deliveries throughout the year, this could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new
manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry, and Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a 17 inch display screen, newly
designed retractable exterior door handles and a panoramic roof, each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges. Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or
difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and
financial condition. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult.
Our ability to sustain volume production and deliveries for Model S is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including:


 

 
 that our suppliers will be able and willing to deliver components in a timely basis and in the necessary quantities, quality and at acceptable prices
to produce Model S in volume and reach our financial targets; 

 

 
 that we will be able to complete any necessary adjustments to the vehicle design or manufacturing processes of Model S in a timely manner that meets
our production plan and allows for high quality vehicles; 

 

 
 that we will be able to launch and ramp Model S in Europe and Asia pursuant to our current timeline; 

 

 
 that we will be able to schedule and complete deliveries at our planned volume production; 

 

 
 that the equipment or tooling which we have purchased or which we select will be able to accurately manufacture the vehicle within specified design
tolerances and will not suffer from unexpected breakdowns or damage which could negatively affect the rate needed to produce vehicles in volume; 

 

 
 that we will be able to comply with environmental, workplace safety and similar regulations to operate our manufacturing facilities and our business on
our projected timeline; 

 

 
 that we will be able to maintain high quality controls as we transition to a higher level of in-house manufacturing process; and


 

 
 that the information technology systems that we are currently expanding and improving upon will be effective to manage high volume production.
Finally, detailed long-term testing of systems integration, performance and safety as well as long-term
quality, reliability and durability testing, such as testing for three-phase charging in Europe, are ongoing and any negative results from such testing could cause production or delivery delays in Model S, cost increases or lower quality Model S
vehicles. We are dependent on our suppliers, the vast majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability
of these suppliers to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects
and operating results. Model S contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 200 direct
suppliers, the vast majority of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, the vast majority of the components used
in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers.
While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement
components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of
our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming, costly and may force us to make
additional modifications to a vehicles design. This supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component
shortages for Model S, as well as for our powertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 could negatively impact our supply chain. We have in the past experienced source
disruptions in our supply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional delays in the future with respect to Model S and any other future vehicle we may
produce. In addition, because we do not have written agreements in place with all of our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding certain suppliers obligations to us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product
liability. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis.
Furthermore, if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at
all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our
quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our
customers and also materially adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results. Changes in our supply chain
have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design
changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign
certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes,
thereby harming Model S quality or reducing Model S production output. Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the
components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles such as Model S could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage
our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. If
we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of Model S or otherwise control the costs associated with operating our business, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects will suffer. Our production costs for Model S have been high due to start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low
absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial prices for component parts during the initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we are now producing cars at
our steady state production volume of 400 vehicles per week, manufacturing costs have started to fall. While we expect further cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue to reduce costs during 2013, there is no
guarantee that we will be able to achieve planned cost reductions from our various cost savings initiatives, and the failure to achieve such savings would negatively affect our ability to reach our gross margin and profitability goals. We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture
our high-performance electric cars, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities, or unexpected
costs or cost overruns associated with the planned launch of Model S in Europe and Asia. If Model S tooling, production equipment and parts are insufficient for use in Model X, perhaps as a result of a lower level of commonality between the two
vehicles than we currently anticipate, our costs related to the production of Model X may exceed expectations. Additionally,
in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been
relatively limited as we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed.
Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to
shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology,
shortages could occur which would result in increased materials costs to us. Our long-term success will be dependent
upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models, specifically Model S and new vehicle models such as Model X, in the U.S. and abroad. Our long-term success is dependent on market acceptance of two new vehicles: the Model S sedan and the Model X crossover. While initial reviews of Model S from both the press and customers have been
positive, there is no guarantee that Model S will be successfully accepted by the general public in the long-term. As we enter into new markets such as Europe and Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in such markets will embrace our vehicles
and if they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations. Additionally, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including Model X, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the
Model X. To the extent that we are not able to build Model X to the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose
confidence in us. Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis
new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and
introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology and meet customer expectations. To date, we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our
electric vehicles. Our future growth is dependent upon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any
reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government
regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically
electric vehicles, include: 

 

 
 perceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially
if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles, such as those related to the Chevrolet Volt battery pack fires; 

 

 
 perceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology, including vehicle
electronics and regenerative braking systems; 

 

 
 negative perceptions of electric vehicles, such as that they are more expensive than non-electric vehicles and are only affordable with government
subsidies; 

 

 
 the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and the effects of weather on this range;


 


 macroeconomic factors. In addition, reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles. Based on internal testing, we estimate that our Tesla Roadster, for
example, would have a 5-10% reduction in range when operated in -20°C temperatures. To the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread
acceptance, our ability to market and sell our vehicles, particularly in colder climates, may be adversely impacted. Additionally, we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact
consumer interest in our vehicles. For example, our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. Due to concerns about overly quiet vehicles and vision impaired pedestrians, in January 2011, Congress passed and the President
signed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. The new law requires NHTSA to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds. NHTSA plans to finalize a rule in 2013 with an effective
date that could be implemented as soon as September 1, 2014. This will begin a three year phase-in schedule for establishing these minimum sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Adding this artificial noise may cause current or
potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk of your investment. You must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with a limited operating history. If we do not successfully
address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. We were formed in July 2003 and began delivering our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. We only began
producing our second electric vehicle, Model S, in June 2012 and our production processes continue to mature, especially those production processes related to our planned Model S deliveries in Europe and Asia. We have historically derived our revenues principally from sales of the Tesla Roadster and from electric powertrain development services
and sales. Model S became the primary contributor to our revenue starting in the fourth quarter of 2012. We intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of Model S, Model X and future electric vehicles. We have only a very
limited operating history with respect to Model S. While we expect Model S cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue to reduce the costs of manufacturing Model S during 2013, the success and timing of such efforts
is difficult to predict, which limits our ability to precisely forecast the cost of producing Model S. Further, we have only produced an early prototype of the Model X crossover and have not yet started production of Model S for Europe or Asia, and
are still in the process of completing homologation of Model S for these new markets. Our vehicle design and our engineering, manufacturing 
and component supply plans for Model S may continue to be adjusted. In addition, our powertrain component sales, development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation
have been almost entirely generated under arrangements with Daimler AG (Daimler) and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota), and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these companies on favorable terms. It is
difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our
estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected. We may fail to
meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock price to decline. We provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance including our projections regarding the number of vehicles we hope to sell in future periods and our anticipated future
revenues and gross margins. Correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process. Our guidance is based in part on assumptions which include, but are not limited to,
assumptions regarding: 

 

 
 our ability to achieve anticipated production and sales volumes and projected average sales prices for Model S in the U.S. and abroad;


 

 
 supplier and commodity-related costs; 

 

 
 planned cost reductions; and 

 

 
 our ability to recognize revenue from Toyota and Daimler and from selling regulatory credits to other automobile manufacturers.
Such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our
assumptions and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors. We offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be accurate, and
investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution. If we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance, even if such failure or revision is seemingly insignificant, investors and analysts may lose
confidence in us and the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to
sell additional regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle (ZEV), greenhouse gas emission (GHG) and corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) credits, to other automobile manufacturers, which would negatively impact our revenues, margins and our
ability to reach profitability. Our revenues to date have included amounts we receive from selling certain regulatory
credits such as ZEV, GHG and CAFE credits to other automobile manufacturers. For example, in the first quarter of 2013 we earned significant revenues from selling ZEV and other regulatory credits, and we have sold substantially all of the ZEV
credits saleable under our existing ZEV credit sale agreements. While we continue our efforts to sign agreements with a limited pool of automakers to sell them ZEV, GHG and other regulatory credits, we may not be able to enter into new agreements to
sell any or all our available regulatory credits related to Model S, Model X or our other future vehicles, which would negatively impact our revenues and margins. Additionally, any inability to sell additional regulatory credits may negatively
impact our ability to maintain profitability in the short term. Our vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch
fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events have raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in automotive applications. The battery pack in the Tesla Roadster and Model S makes use of lithium-ion cells. We also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion
cells in battery packs that we sell to Toyota and Daimler as well as any future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby
materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. More recently, multiple Chevrolet Volt battery pack
fires, followed by a government investigation into the cause of such fires focused considerable public attention, as well as the attention of NHTSA, on the safety of electric vehicles. These events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number
of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cells release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells and we are
not aware of any such incident in our customers vehicles. However, we have delivered only a limited number of Tesla Roadsters and Model S sedans to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles, especially Model S. We have also
only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our Model S or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or
lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive.
Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could
seriously harm our business. In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility.
Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells
would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitors electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells
similar to the Tesla Roadster or Model S, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
If our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer product recalls
for Model S, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed. Our vehicles, or vehicles
that contain our powertrains such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or future Daimler vehicles, may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our vehicles use a substantial
amount of software code to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may have unexpected effects. Recent Model S issues experienced by customers include
those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the retractable exterior door handles and the 12V battery. Although we are attempting to remedy the Model S issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner by expanding our service
centers and personnel, such efforts may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of
reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. Specifically, we have only a limited amount of data by which to evaluate Model S, upon which our business prospects depend, due to the fact that
we only recently began production in June 2012. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. We experienced product recalls in May 2009 and October 2010, both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused
by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not
contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible
fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. Although the cost of this recall was not material, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our
business, prospects and results of operations. Our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers
expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market.
Additionally, while we have designed Model S with the intent to achieve an overall five star safety rating, NHTSA testing of these vehicles is not scheduled until later this year and may not produce the anticipated results. Any product defects or
any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and
significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. We have a history of losses and have to deliver significant cost reductions to maintain profitability and long-term commercial success. We have had net losses in each quarter since our inception, except for the first quarter of 2013. Even if we are able to successfully
maintain our current Model S production levels, there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful. In order to maintain profitability as well as long-term commercial success, we must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions
and control our operational costs while producing quality Model S vehicles at volume, maintain our Model S delivery rates to match our current and anticipated Model S production capacity, maintain strong demand for Model S in the U.S., grow demand
for Model S abroad, and achieve our planned cost reductions and control our operational costs. Failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from reaching profitability. Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular lithium-ion cells, could harm our business.
We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any
such increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper. The prices for
these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for
lithium-ion cells. These risks include: 

 

 
 the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of
lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases; 

 

 
 disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers; 

 

 
 an increase in the cost of raw materials, such as nickel used in lithium-ion cells, or aluminum used in the body of Model S; and


 

 
 fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as our battery cell purchases are currently denominated in yen.
Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles battery packs as
well as for the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only a limited number of suppliers for the cells used in
such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of Model S and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile
manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs.
Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs
through increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase Model S prices in response to increased raw material costs
could be viewed negatively by our customers, result in cancellations of Model S reservations and could materially adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results. Our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or our products, particularly Model S. From time to time, our vehicles are evaluated by third parties. For example, the show Top Gear which airs on the British Broadcasting
Corporation did a review of the Tesla Roadster in 2008. Top Gear is one of the most watched automotive shows in the world with an estimated 350 million viewers worldwide and is broadcast in over 100 countries. Since originally airing in the
fall of 2008, the episode about the Tesla Roadster has been rebroadcast repeatedly around the world. The review of the Tesla Roadster included a number of significant falsehoods regarding the cars performance, range and safety. Such criticisms
create a negative public perception about the Tesla Roadster, and to the extent that these comments are believed by the public, may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles such as Model S or Model X,
which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Most recently,
the New York Times published a review of the Model S and our Supercharger network on a route from Washington, D.C. to Boston. Despite instructions to the contrary, the reporter did not follow all recommendations, including failing to fully recharge
the vehicle at one of the two Supercharger locations along the route. As a result, the Model S failed to complete the journey under its own power and the NY Times reporter published a negative review. While there were subsequent corrections by the
NY Times Public Editor regarding the reporters failure to conform to all Tesla recommendations, as well as problems with precision and judgment, the original story still created a negative public perception about Model S, its
capabilities and the Supercharger network. Such comments can and did negatively impact sales in that region. In addition, citation to the original NY Times article still continues. To the extent that these comments are believed by the public, this
may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, including Model S and Model X, which can materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial conditions and prospects. The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time
which may negatively influence potential customers decisions whether to purchase our vehicles. The range and
power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as other factors. How a customer uses their Tesla vehicle, the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state
of charge and the means of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery packs ability to hold a charge over the long term. For example, we currently expect that our battery pack for the Tesla Roadster will retain
approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicles initial range and power. Deterioration of the Model S battery pack is expected to
be less than the Roadster; however, such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our
vehicles. We are dependent upon our loan facility from the United States Department of Energy. We have relied on our DOE Loan Facility to develop and produce Model S and develop the Tesla Factory. Our DOE Loan Facility provided for a
$465.0 million loan facility under the DOEs ATVM Program to help finance the development of Model S, including the increase in production capacity and operation of our manufacturing facility, and to finance the build out and
operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility. All advanced funds, as of the most recent amendment to the DOE Loan Facility in March 2013, are repayable on a quarterly basis through December 15, 2017. Our DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the project be conducted in
accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or
acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, prepay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business and enter
into certain restrictive agreements. These restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may cause us to take actions or prevent us from taking actions we believe are necessary from a competitive standpoint or that we otherwise
believe are necessary to grow our business. In addition, our DOE Loan Facility also contains a variety of customary financial covenants, including covenants related to current ratio, leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage
ratio. We modified certain of these covenants in February 2012, September 2012, and again in March 2013. If we do not
comply with the requirements of the DOE Loan Facility, such failure, if not waived by the DOE, could cause a default under the DOE Loan Facility. In the event of a default, the DOE could declare the existing outstanding loan amounts to be due
immediately. Any acceleration of the repayment of outstanding loan amounts would materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. If, in the future, we are not able to comply with our covenants, including as set forth above, we may need
to seek additional waivers, and there can be no assurance the DOE will be willing to grant such waivers at that time. We also have cross-default provisions in contracts with certain equipment lessors and suppliers, pursuant to which an event of
default under the DOE Loan Facility may result in a default under such contract, which could lead to termination of such contract, an acceleration of obligations, payment of liquidated damages and/or repossession of leased property by an equipment
lessor. In addition, our DOE Loan Facility requires Mr. Musk and certain of his affiliates, until one year after we
complete the project relating to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of the Tesla capital stock held by them as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility, and a failure to comply would be an event of default that could result in an acceleration of
all obligations under the DOE Loan Facility documents and the exercise of other remedies by the DOE. We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems. If these
implementations are not successful, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally developed systems, to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our
volume production of Model S in the U.S. and abroad will necessitate the development, maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems which include product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and
execution, sales and logistics, dealer management, financial and regulatory compliance systems. These systems support our operations and enable us to produce Model S in volume. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems require
significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement
processes, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales processes that may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell and deliver vehicles to our Tesla stores and customers. We
cannot be sure that these expanded systems or their required functionality will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, or maintained. If we do not successfully implement, improve or maintain these systems, our operations
may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. In addition, these systems or their functionality may not operate as we expect them to, and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative
sources for performing these functions. Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution
model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult. Our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today, particularly in the United States. We plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles in company-owned Tesla stores and
over the internet. This model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion
of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we will not be able to utilize long-established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our
sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well-established distribution channels. We have opened Tesla stores in the United States, Europe and Japan, many of which have been open for only a short period of time. We have
only limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our
business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. In April 2011, we began the roll out of our new
interactive store strategy. The concept and layout of these new stores, which are located in high profile retail centers, is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales. We do not know whether our new store strategy will be
successful, if consumers will be willing to purchase vehicles in this manner or if these locations will be deemed to comply with applicable zoning restrictions as well as approval and acceptance from the specific high profile retail centers in which
we seek to locate our stores. As a result, we may incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy. Other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional
automobile manufacturers. For example, , we do not anticipate that we will ever carry a significant amount of Model S inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they
receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle. If customers do not
embrace this ordering and retail experience, our business will be harmed. You must consider our business and prospects in
light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties we encounter as we implement our business model. For instance, we will need to persuade customers, suppliers and regulators of the validity and sustainability of our business model. We cannot be
certain that we will be able to do so, or to successfully address the risks, uncertainties and difficulties that our business strategy faces. Any failure to successfully address any of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties related to our
business model would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We may face regulatory limitations
on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles. We sell our vehicles from our Tesla stores as well as over the internet. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as many states have laws that
may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an
independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. For example, some states provide that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of their state except through a dealer licensed to do business in such state, which may
be interpreted to require us to open a store in that state in order to sell vehicles to their residents. In some states where we have opened a gallery, which is a location where potential customers can view our vehicles but is not a full retail
location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. In addition, some states have
requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state
thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. The foregoing examples
of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor
vehicle industry laws, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we
advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact
specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which
the applicable authorities will apply their state laws to our distribution model is difficult to predict. Such laws, as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry, may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state
motor vehicle regulators who may question whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such
states. In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to
challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, in October 2012, vehicle dealer associations in New York and Massachusetts filed lawsuits to revoke the dealer license issued to Tesla
Motors New York in New York and to limit the business activity of Tesla Motors MA, Inc. in Massachusetts. Although we believe that Massachusetts and New York laws, as well as other state laws, were not designed to prevent our distribution model,
such challenges in these states, and possible similar challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, such as Massachusetts and Minnesota, there are
also legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. We are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to
sell vehicles in other places such as Hong Kong and Singapore. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not
performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our
vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.
Reservations for Model S and Model X are fully refundable to customers, and significant cancellations could harm our
financial condition, business, prospects and operating results. As of March 31, 2013, we had $130.7 million in
reservation payments (now referred to as customer deposits), primarily for Model S and Model X, all of which are subject to cancellation by the customer up until such time that the customer enters into a purchase agreement. We have experienced
ongoing cancellations for our vehicles and have had to refund the related reservation payments, and cancellations may continue. Given the long lead times that we have historically experienced between customer reservation and delivery on the Tesla Roadster and on
Model S and that we expect to experience on Model X, there is a heightened risk that customers that have made reservations may cancel such reservations and not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences,
competitive developments and other factors. For example, when we delayed the introduction of the original Tesla Roadster in the fall of 2007, we experienced a significant number of customers that cancelled their reservations and requested the return
of their reservation payment. Cancellations on Model S have recently increased as we have asked numerous customers on the reservation list to configure their cars for delivery or risk losing their production slot and/or their 2012 pricing.
Additionally, a number of our reservation holders are also electing to defer configuring their cars or have not responded to
our invitations to them to configure their cars for delivery. It is likely that a portion of these customers will ultimately cancel their reservations, thereby resulting in higher cancellation rates. Furthermore, if we encounter delays in the
planned launch and production ramp of Model S for Europe or Asia, or the introduction of Model X, we believe that a significant number of our customers could similarly cancel their reservations and demand refunds of their reservation payments. As a
result, no assurance can be made that reservations will not be cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase, delivery, and sale of the vehicle. Although we are transitioning away from a reservations model, significant cancellations
could harm our financial condition, business, prospects and operating results. We may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network which could harm our
business, brand and operating results. We have only recently started to deploy Tesla Superchargers in the United
States. Tesla Superchargers are a network of charging stations designed to provide fast-charge capability to owners of Model S vehicles equipped with Supercharger hardware. We intend to expand the Tesla Supercharger network throughout the U.S.,
Canada and Europe, but we may be unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the inability to secure, or delays in securing, suitable locations and permits, difficulties in interfacing with the infrastructures of various utility companies
and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing, maintaining and operating the network. We may also be unable to expand the Supercharger network as fast as we intend or as the public expects, or to place the charging stations in
places our customers believe to be optimal. In addition, as we have announced that we will not be charging our customers to access this network, any significant unexpected costs that we encounter may harm our operating results. Although our
Supercharger network is intended to address customer concerns regarding long-distance travel, this network may not result in increased reservations or sales of Model S or future vehicles. If our Supercharger network is not expanded as currently
planned or as fast as planned, we may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network and our business and operating results could be materially affected. If we are unable to design, develop, market and sell new electric vehicles and services that address additional market opportunities, our business, prospects and operating results will suffer.
We may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles and services, address new market segments or develop
a significantly broader customer base. In 2012, we publicly revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We have also previously announced our intent to develop a
third generation electric vehicle which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of Model S and Model X. However, we have not yet finalized the design, engineering or component sourcing plans for these vehicles and there are
no assurances that we will be able to bring these vehicles to market at the price points and in the volumes as we currently intend, if at all. Our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. If we are unable to effectively leverage the benefits of using an adaptable common
platform architecture in the design and manufacture of future vehicles such as Model X, our business prospects, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of Model S
to create future electric vehicles, including, as an example, our Model X crossover vehicle. However, we have no experience with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles. The Model X design is not yet finalized and we may
be unable to use the adaptable Model S platform to the extent we currently intend. Additionally, we intend to use some of our Model S manufacturing equipment and parts tooling for the production of Model X. If such tooling, production equipment and
parts are insufficient for use in Model X, perhaps as a result of a lower level of commonality between the two vehicles than we anticipate, our costs related to the production of Model X may exceed expectations. There are no assurances that we
will be able to use the Model S platform to bring future vehicle models, including the Model X crossover, to market faster or more inexpensively by leveraging use of this common platform or that there will be sufficient customer demand for any
vehicles built on the Model S platform. We may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture and launch of Model X
which could harm our business and prospects. We plan to start Model X production in late 2014. Any significant delay
in the design, manufacture and launch of Model X could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture and commercial release of
new vehicle models. We experienced significant delays in launching the Tesla Roadster, which resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business. In 2012, we also experienced delays in the ramp of Model S. We may experience similar
delays, cost overruns and adverse publicity in launching Model X, any of which could be significant. We are in the initial design and development stages of Model X. Furthermore, we have not yet evaluated, qualified or selected all of our suppliers
for the planned production of Model X. We may not be able to engage suppliers for the components in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities. We will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model X is in
compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and obtain EPA and CARB certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles. In addition, we have limited resources and, to the extent that such
engineering and manufacturing resources are devoted to the design and production of Model S or are otherwise engaged such as in development services activities as they have been up until now, we may have difficulty designing and delivering Model X
in a timely manner. If we are not able to manufacture and deliver Model X in a timely manner and consistent with our production timeline, budget and cost projections, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be
negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed. The automotive market is highly competitive,
and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future. The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even
more so in the future. Other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter this market. With respect to Model S, we face competition from existing and future automobile
manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Many established
and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. In December 2010, Nissan introduced in the United States
the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle and Ford introduced the pure electric Ford Focus and plug-in hybrid Ford C-Max Energi and Ford Fusion Energi in 2012 and plans to introduce a plug-in hybrid Ford CMax in 2012. In addition, several
manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced
the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack. Moreover, it has been reported that many of the large OEMs such as BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault and Volkswagen are also developing
electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a
number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. Most of our current and potential competitors have
significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products.
Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and

greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more
effectively. Additionally, we have not in the past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do. We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive
industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit
sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to
our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality,
price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could
result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating
results. Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,
operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. For example, according to automotive industry sources,
sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social
conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the
market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we sell our electric vehicles will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric
vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental
regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. Difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer purchases of luxury items, such as our performance electric vehicles.
Over the last few years, the continued challenging macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending
and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our vehicles. The automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor economic conditions and several vehicle manufacturing companies, including General Motors and Chrysler, were
forced to file for bankruptcy. Sales of new automobiles in our two primary markets of the United States and Europe generally have dropped during this recessionary period, and have not yet recovered in Europe. Sales of high-end and luxury consumer
products, such as our performance electric vehicles, depend in part on 
discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions. Difficult economic conditions could therefore temporarily reduce the market for
vehicles in our price range. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors, including changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit. If the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen, we may experience a decline in the demand for Model S or future vehicles
such as Model X, any of which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We plan to grow our sales in Europe and Asia in 2013 and beyond. If there is a continued downturn in the European economy, our
prospects of growth in Europe could be severally constrained which may harm our financial condition and operating results. Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business, fluctuations in our
operating costs and other factors. Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many
factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry in general, typically decline over the winter season, while sales are generally higher during the
spring and summer months. Sales of the Tesla Roadster have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note
that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S, Model X and other models we introduce may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for
us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue
consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. In addition, we expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design,
develop and manufacture Model X and electric powertrain components, increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce Model S and electric powertrain components, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair
capabilities, incur costs for warranty repairs or product recalls, if any, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe
that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not
meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our
industry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially. Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years
from now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced
that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced
that our business will succeed. For example, during the economic downturn of 2008, we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations, and, as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2008 we had to

lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans. In addition, during this period a number of customers canceled their previously placed reservations. If we are required to take
similar actions in the future, such actions may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or Model X reservations. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts and other
parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more established automakers, we believe that, in our case, the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following:


 

 
 our limited operating history; 

 

 
 unfamiliarity with or uncertainty about Model S and Model X; 

 

 
 uncertainty about the long-term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles generally, or electric vehicles specifically;


 

 
 the perceived prospect that we will need ongoing infusions of external capital to fund our planned operations; 

 

 
 the size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operations; and 

 

 
 the prospect or actual emergence of direct, sustained competitive pressure from more established automakers, which may be more likely if our initial
efforts are perceived to be commercially successful. Many of these factors are largely outside our control,
and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed. We may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise
additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. The design,
manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business. As of March 31, 2013, we had approximately $231.1 million in principal sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. This includes
our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of approximately $214.4 million which includes our investments in money market funds, as well as restricted cash of $14.8 million. We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans. However, until we are
consistently generating positive free cash flows, if the costs for developing and manufacturing Model S variants or Model X exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new
significant strategic investments, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund
our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover, establish sales and service centers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model
X. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be
materially adversely affected. 
Additionally, under our DOE Loan Facility, we face restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and in the future may need to obtain a waiver from the DOE in order to do so. We
may not be able to obtain such waiver from the DOE which may harm our business. Future issuance of equity or equity-related securities will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and our issuance of debt securities could increase the
risk or perceived risk of our company. We relied on the DOE Loan Facility to develop and produce Model S and develop the
Tesla Factory. We do not currently have any similar type of loan facility in place for our Model X or any future vehicles. In addition, we have only recently begun to accept customer reservation payments on Model X, can provide no assurance that
customers will be willing to make such payments and accordingly may be reliant on other sources to fund the development of this vehicle. We have very limited experience servicing our vehicles and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry. If we are unable to address the service requirements of
our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to
successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers and meet customer expectations regarding service, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. We have only produced and delivered a limited
number of Roadsters and Model S vehicles. We have very limited experience servicing our vehicles, particularly our Model S vehicle. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires
specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues that they are facing and may face in the future, our ability to generate
customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional Model S vehicles could be impaired. We service our performance
electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, and to date we have
only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations. We will need to open new standalone service centers and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers, in
order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers vehicles. There can be no
assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service
requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. We do not expect to be
able to open Tesla service centers in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In order to address the service needs of customers that are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to
either transport those vehicles to the nearest Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers to service the vehicles at the customers location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able
to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our
customers service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather
service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service 
providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be
providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our vehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service
stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects. In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles
physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While
we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of shipping customers vehicles to our nearest Tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances
that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also
restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Teslas service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law, which may harm our business. We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the Tesla brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer
acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects. Our business and prospects are
heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand. Any failure to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X and future planned electric
vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend
significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota RAV4 EV which uses a Tesla powertrain, potential
future Daimler vehicles that use Tesla powertrains or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand. In addition, we expect that our
ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth
and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use
traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly
automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong
brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted. If
our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products, the vehicle may not operate properly, which could harm our business. Automobile enthusiasts may seek to hack our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems.
Also, we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with after-market parts that may compromise driver safety. For example, some customers have installed 
seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised. Other customers have changed wheels and tires, while others have installed large speaker systems that
may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle. We have not tested, nor do we endorse, such changes or products. In addition, customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high voltage
electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results. Regulators could review our practice of taking reservation and deposit
payments and, if the practice is deemed to violate applicable law, we could be required to pay penalties, refund the payments stop accepting additional payments, and restructure certain aspects of our sales program. For customers interested in making a reservation or order for Model S or Model X, we require an initial fully refundable reservation
payment. We generally use these funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes. California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed auto dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles
before the vehicles are available to the dealer from the manufacturer. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation policies and advertising
comply with the California Vehicle Code. To date, we have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance
that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. In addition, California is currently the only jurisdiction in which we have licenses to both manufacture and sell our vehicles so any
limitation imposed on our operations in California may be particularly damaging to our business. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically
exercised in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions. Certain states may
have specific laws which apply to reservation payments accepted by dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payments received from residents in
the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated
account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payments received from customers. Our inability to
access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have
not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our
vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Reductions in our cash as a result of redemptions or an inability to take reservation payments could make it necessary to raise additional funds and also make it more difficult for us to
obtain additional financing. The prospect of reductions in cash, even if unrealized, may also make it more difficult to obtain financing. Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric
vehicles. In addition, we may not be able to open stores in certain states. Our plan to expand our network of Tesla
stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric 
vehicles. This planned global expansion of Tesla stores may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating. Furthermore there
can be no assurances that we will be able to construct additional storefronts on the budget or timeline we have established. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale of our vehicles in
those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays in expanding our network of Tesla stores, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results. We have opened Tesla stores in major metropolitan areas throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We plan to open additional stores, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within
the next several years in connection with the Model S rollout. However, we may not be able to expand our network at such rate and our planned expansion of our network of Tesla stores will require significant cash investment and management resources,
as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these storefronts and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell our vehicles. Furthermore, certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements, franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell
vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions. Any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. See Risk Factor We may face regulatory
limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles. We face risks associated with our international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor
conditions, which could harm our business. We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in
these jurisdictions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we intend to expand our sales, maintenance and repair services internationally. However, we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally and
such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures, including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities, in advance of generating any revenue. We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business
activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include: 

 

 
 conforming our vehicles to various international regulatory and safety requirements where our vehicles are sold, or homologation;


 

 
 difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; 

 

 
 difficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions; 

 

 
 foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us
in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States; 

 

 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we
undertake; 

 

 
 our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan and European countries, which increases the risk of unauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technology; 

 

 
 United States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls; 

 

 
 foreign labor laws, regulations and restrictions; 

 

 
 preferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles; 

 

 
 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; 

 

 
 political instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and 

 

 
 the strength of international economies. If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar could harm our financial results. Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. For example, a portion of our costs and expenses for
the three months ended March 31, 2013 was denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound. Conversely for this period until such time as we begin shipping significant quantities of Model S vehicles
to Europe and Asia, we expect that a significant majority of our revenue will be denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, especially against the Japanese yen, our
costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. As we begin selling Model S overseas in 2013, as well as
delivering powertrain units to Daimler, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in which case a strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars. Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the
demand for our electric vehicles. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel,
ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop
new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our
vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. The unavailability, reduction or elimination of
government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the customer
base of our electric vehicles, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the
growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and
economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically. For example, we currently benefit from exemptions from California state sales and use taxes for purchases of up to $612 million of
manufacturing equipment from our arrangements with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales and use
tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us through January 2015. This exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to California sales and use taxes and that would be used only for specified
purposes. If we fail to meet these conditions, we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed. In addition, certain regulations and laws that encourage sales of electric cars through tax credits or other subsidies could be reduced, eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect
against our vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, while the federal and state governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars, funding for these
programs is limited and there is no guarantee that our vehicles will be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future. This would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. As an example at the
state level, California renewed the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program for 2012 a rebate program for the purchase of qualified alternative technology vehicles. California recently reduced the rebate amount from $5,000 per vehicle to $2,500 per vehicle due
to fewer funds available and increased demand, and such funds may run out or be limited in ways that would be adverse to purchasers of our vehicles. Subsequent purchasers could face a delay in receiving rebates since they would have to wait until
the next fiscal years funding became available or be unable to obtain a rebate at all. As an additional example, there is considerable discussion at the federal level over tax reform. Discussions have included reducing or even eliminating the
current $7,500 tax credit available to purchasers of qualified alternative fuel vehicles, including Model S. Also, government disincentives have been enacted in Europe for gas-powered vehicles, which discourage the use of such vehicles and allow us
to set a higher sales price for the Tesla Roadster in Europe. In the event that such disincentives are reduced or eliminated, sales of electric vehicles, including our Tesla Roadster and Model S, could be adversely affected. Our relationship with Daimler is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects.
Our relationship with Daimler poses various risks to us including: 

 

 
 potential loss of access to parts that Daimler is providing for Model S; 

 

 
 potential loss of business and adverse publicity to our brand image if there are defects or other problems discovered with our electric powertrain
components that Daimler has incorporated into their vehicles; and 

 

 
 potential inability to successfully negotiate an agreement to supply Daimler with production parts for the Mercedez-Benz B-Class EV.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating
results. The operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles
and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking. We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar
to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel
brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed. Accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use
safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicles acceleration and speed will decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete
its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of
speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation,
result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may choose not to buy
additional cars from us which could also harm our business and prospects. If we are unable to keep up with advances in
electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position. We may be unable to keep up with
changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would
materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to
upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are
not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not manufacture battery cells, which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs. If we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company, we may not be able to produce, market, sell and
service our vehicles successfully. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect
our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We continue to expand our operations significantly, and additional significant expansion will be required, especially in connection with the expansion of our network of Tesla
stores, service centers and our mobile Tesla Rangers program across the United States as well as in Europe and Asia. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we
face in undertaking this expansion include: 

 

 
 finding and training new personnel; 

 

 
 forecasting production and revenue; 

 

 
 controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations; 

 

 
 establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities; 

 

 
 implementing and enhancing manufacturing and administrative infrastructure, systems and processes; 

 

 
 addressing new markets; and 

 

 
 expanding international operations. We intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel, including manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles.
Because our high-performance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines, individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles may not be available to hire, and we will need to
expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain
additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects. If we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical vehicle engineering, and
manufacturing personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline. The loss of the
services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline.
In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and JB Straubel, our Chief Technical Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an
employment agreement for any specific term. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our
executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past
and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical, vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented
individuals with automotive experience. In addition, we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees. Currently in Northern California, there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, software engineers, manufacturing engineers and other
skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones. Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain employees. Additionally, we compete with many mature and
prosperous companies in Northern California that have far greater financial resources than we do and thus can offer current or perspective employees more lucrative incentive packages than we can. Any difficulties in retaining current employees or
recruiting news ones would have an adverse effect on our performance. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon
Musk, our Chief Executive Officer. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer,
Product Architect, Chairman of our Board of Directors and largest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk
also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and Chairman of SolarCity, a solar equipment installation company. Furthermore, our DOE Loan Facility provides that we will be in default under the facility in
the event Mr. Musk and certain of his affiliates fail to own, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to Model S, at least 65% of the capital stock held by Mr. Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE
Loan Facility. Mr. Musks shares of our capital stock are held directly by his personal trust. We are subject
to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities. As an automobile manufacturer, we and our operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to national, state, provincial
and/or local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex,
and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect
on our business. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations. Contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us, as well as at properties we will own and operate, and properties to which
hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which can impose
liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources.
The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and negatively impact our
ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. New United
Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) has previously identified environmental conditions at the Tesla Factory which affect soil and groundwater, and has undertaken efforts to address these conditions. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has
documented and managed the environmental issues at the Fremont site, we cannot currently determine with certainty the total potential costs to remediate pre-existing contamination, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the
existence of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site. As the owner of the Fremont site, we may be responsible
under federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site, whether it occurred before or after the date we purchase the property. We have reached an agreement
with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown
environmental conditions (Remediation Activities), and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such Remediation Activities. Our agreement 
provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such
costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has
been spent on the Remediation Activities, whichever comes first, NUMMIs liability to us with respect to Remediation Activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time,
we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability, including attorney fees, or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released
NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMIs obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of March 31, 2013, we have accrued $5.3 million related to these environmental liabilities. There are no assurances that NUMMI will perform its obligations under our agreement and NUMMIs failure to perform would require us
to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost and risk to our ability to increase the production capacity of, and operate, our Tesla Factory. Any Remediation Activities or other environmental conditions at the Fremont site could
harm our operations and the future use and value of the Fremont site and could delay our production plans for Model S. Our business may be adversely affected by union activities. Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for
many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union
signatory. Additionally, disgruntled ex-employees may actively encourage unionization of Tesla employees. Our automobile production facility in Fremont, California was purchased from NUMMI. Prior employees of NUMMI were union members and our future
work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union. We are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work
stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. The mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock
price. Additionally, the unionization of our labor force could increase our employee costs and decrease our profitability, both of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these
regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results. Our performance electric vehicles, the sale
of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, significant costs in
complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently
evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations such as: 

 

 
 the imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities could increase the cost of electricity;


 

 
 increasingly stringent Clean Air Act emission regulations affecting power plants used to generate electricity could increase the cost of electricity;


 

 
 changes to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of lithium-ion battery packs, such as the UN Recommendations of the Safe Transport
of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations or regulations adopted by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) could increase the cost of lithium-ion battery packs or restrict their transport; 

 

 
 the amendment or rescission of the federal law and regulations mandating increased fuel economy in the United States, referred to as the Corporate
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities; 

 

 
 the amendment or rescission of federal greenhouse gas tailpipe emission regulations administered by EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act could
reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities; 

 

 
 the amendment or rescission of Californias zero emission vehicle regulations administered by the California Air Resources Board under the
California Health & Safety Code could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities, as well as our ability to monetize ZEV credits not only in California, but also in the eleven additional states
that have adopted the California program; 

 

 
 increased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs and business
models based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs of such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles; and


 

 
 changes to regulations governing the export of our products could increase our costs incurred to deliver products outside the United States or force us
to charge a higher price for our vehicles in such jurisdictions. In addition, as the automotive industry
moves towards greater use of electronics for vehicle systems, NHTSA and other regulatory bodies may in the future increase regulation for these electronic systems as concerns about distracted driving increase. Such concerns could affect electronic
systems in Model S, including those used with the 17 inch display screen in Model S which could reduce the appeal of Model S or require adjustments to the display screens functionality. To the extent the laws change, some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws,
which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results will be adversely affected. We retain certain personal information about our customers
and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws. We use our vehicles electronic systems to
log information about each vehicles condition, performance and use in order to aid us in providing customer service, including vehicle diagnostics, repair and maintenance, as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers charge
time, battery usage, mileage and efficiency habits and to improve our vehicles. Our customers may object to the processing of 
this data, which may negatively impact our ability to provide effective customer service and develop new vehicles and products. Collection and use of our customers personal information in
conducting our business may be subject to federal and/or state laws and regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and such laws and regulations may restrict our processing of such personal information and hinder our ability to
acquire new customers or market to existing customers. We may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy, consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.
Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal
information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future
prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and brand. We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims. We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.
The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this
area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles, including Model S. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary
award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our
brand, business, prospects and operating results. We self insure against the risk of product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.
We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy.
We may be compelled to undertake product recalls, which could adversely affect our brand image and financial
performance. Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect
our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We previously experienced product recalls in May 2009 and October 2010, both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain. In April 2009, we determined that a condition caused
by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt,
low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In the future, we may at various times,
voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our vehicles, including Model S, or electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, voluntary or
involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations. Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty
claims which could adversely affect our financial performance. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future
warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We provide a three year or 36,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we
extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase Extended Service plans for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the Tesla
Roadster to cover additional services for up to an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery, we
provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the purchasers of Model S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of
the vehicles battery, although the batterys charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the
period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided it is purchased within a specified period of time. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty and Extended
Service plans for each of the Tesla Roadster and Model S are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and is
intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, powertrain and brake system. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster
customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles and also recently
announced a battery replacement option for our Model S in which customers may purchase, within a specified period of time, a one-time option (subject to certain limitations and exclusions) to replace the battery at any time before the twelfth
anniversary of such purchase date, with certain price adjustments depending upon the year the battery is replaced. We record
and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. For new vehicles in particular, we record warranty reserves based on managements best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate
historical data is accumulated over a period of time, generally a few quarters. As we have limited operating experience with Model S, and therefore little experience with warranty claims for this vehicle, reserves that we recorded for Model S
may be insufficient to cover all future warranty claims. Additionally, in April 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience, we made the Model S battery warranty a no fault warranty and also
eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in effect. Should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims, we may need to record additional warranty reserves which
would negatively affect our profitability. Since we began initiating sales of our vehicles, we have continued to refine our
warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience and we may be required to undertake further such changes in the future. As of March 31, 2013, we had warranty reserves of $24.1 million, and such reserve amount will increase in
the future as Model S is sold. We could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense. There can be no assurances that our currently existing or future warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims due to
potential higher average warranty expenses over the product life cycle or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction. The introduction of our residual value guarantee may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the
extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values of these cars are below the guaranteed value. We recently announced that we would provide a residual value guarantee to all customers who
purchased a vehicle and financed it with one of our specified commercial banking partners. Customers who purchase and finance their vehicles in this manner have the option of selling their vehicles back to us after a period from 36 to 39 months
for a predetermined residual value. As a result of this residual value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us, we expect to apply lease accounting to such purchases which would defer the recognition of the
associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at Model S delivery. Although lease accounting will not impact our cash flows and liquidity, a significant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term
revenues and operating results. While we do not assume any credit risk of the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles residual value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher
than our estimates. Currently, there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles in particular, and electric vehicles in general, on which to base our estimates, and such a secondary market may not develop in the future. Our
residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect, either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to grow our sales of electric vehicle components to original equipment manufacturers our financial results may suffer. We may have trouble attracting and retaining powertrain customers which could adversely affect our business prospects and results. Daimler
and its affiliates and Toyota and its affiliates are currently the only customers of our electric powertrain sales and development services. In 2012, we entered into a development agreement for the development of a full electric powertrain for a
Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-class EV by the end of 2013. We have not, however, yet completed our development activities or entered into an agreement to supply Daimler with production electric powertrain systems. Should this not occur, our future sales
growth and financial results would be adversely affected. In July 2011, we entered into a supply and services agreement with
Toyota for the supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery pack, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software for integration into the electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Pursuant to this
agreement, we expect that Toyota will pay us approximately $100 million between 2012 and 2014 based on our delivery of electric powertrain systems. The payments to us under the Toyota agreement are not guaranteed and will only occur upon the delivery of powertrain systems that meet Toyotas specifications. Toyota is not obligated to buy any
systems from us, and if Toyota does not order the anticipated systems from us, we will not receive the revenues we anticipate from this agreement. This agreement further requires that we meet customary obligations such as timely deliveries, warranty
and product quality obligations. Our failure to meet these obligations could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results. Additionally, although we have discussed new business opportunities with each of Daimler and Toyota, there is no
guarantee that we will be able to reach agreement with Daimler, Toyota or their respective affiliates regarding such opportunities at all or on terms and conditions that are favorable to us. Even if we can attract and retain additional powertrain
customers other than Daimler and Toyota, there is no assurance that we can adequately pursue such opportunities simultaneously with the execution of our plans for our vehicles. We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to
incur substantial costs. Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain
patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, 
develop or sell our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks
inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs, electric motors or electronic power management systems may bring suits alleging infringement of such
rights or otherwise asserting their rights and seeking licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third partys intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following: 

 

 
 cease selling, incorporating or using vehicles that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 

 

 
 pay substantial damages; 

 

 
 obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or


 

 
 redesign our vehicles. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology, our business, prospects, operating results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We also license patents and other intellectual property from third parties, and we may face claims that our use of this in-licensed
technology infringes the rights of others. In that case, we may seek indemnification from our licensors under our license contracts with them. However, our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses,
depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or
infringement by third parties. Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our
competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success
depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party
nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to
manufacturing our vehicles. The protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities.
However, such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following: 

 

 
 our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents; 

 

 
 our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights; 

 

 
 the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented
intellectual property rights or for other reasons; 

 

 
 the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive
enforcement impracticable; 

 

 
 current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents
our patents; and 

 

 
 our in-licensed patents may be invalidated or the holders of these patents may seek to breach our license arrangements. Existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some
foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Unauthorized use or infringement of our trademarks in
countries which have a first-to-file patent system could affect our ability to successfully grow our business internationally. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.
We cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first
to file patent applications on these inventions, nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor. In addition, patent applications
filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will result in issued patents.
Furthermore, even if these patent applications do result in issued patents, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States. The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. As a result, we cannot
be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued, or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the near future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In
addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results. Our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to
outstanding opposition proceedings. We currently sell and market our vehicles in various countries under our Tesla
marks. We have filed trademark applications for our Tesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our vehicles. Certain of our trademark
applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior use of similar marks. If we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries, our ability to
challenge third party users of the Tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted. In addition, there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take
actions to challenge our use of the Tesla marks in these countries. Such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla marks in these countries. If we were prevented from using the
Tesla marks in any or all of these countries, we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets. We may be subject to claims arising from an airplane crash in which three of our
employees died. In February 2010, three of our employees died in a crash of an airplane owned and piloted by one of
our employees. The plane crashed in a neighborhood in East Palo Alto, California. The plane also clipped an electrical tower, causing a power loss and business interruption in parts of Palo Alto, including Stanford University. The cause of the
accident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. In November 2010, a case was filed against us
relating to the crash in California Superior Court. In that case, plaintiffs allege claims for negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, trespass, and violations of federal and state aviation laws and regulations against all
defendants, and seek compensation for real property damage and loss of use, as well as personal property and emotional distress/bodily injury claims. In December 2010, the plaintiffs settled claims for real property damage but retained their claims
for emotional distress, bodily injury and personal property damage. We believe that these remaining claims are covered by insurance. As a result of the accident, other claims, including but not limited to those arising from loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or damage to the electrical tower and
surrounding area, may be asserted against various parties including us. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims. We may also incur costs both in defending against any claims and for any judgments if
such claims are adversely determined. Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result
of disasters or unpredictable events. Our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto and Tesla Factory in Fremont are located
in Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications
network breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, our lease for our Palo Alto facility permits the
landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If our suppliers fail to use ethical
business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity. Our core values, which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity, are an important component of our brand image, which makes our reputation particularly
sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices. We do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices, such as environmental
responsibility, fair wage practices, appropriate sourcing of raw materials, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result
in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other
laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent suppliers labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us
and our brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. If we, or other manufacturers in our industry,
encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over
financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our
company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our
internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Complying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. As a result of developing,
improving and expanding our core information technology systems as well as implementing new systems to support our sales, engineering, supply chain and manufacturing activities, all of which require significant management time and support, we may
not be able to complete our internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to
assert that our internal controls are effective. For example, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2012 because a material weakness existed in our internal control over
financial reporting related to the presentation and disclosure of non-cash capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our
independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material
adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Risks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from
influencing significant corporate decisions. As of December 31, 2012, our executive officers, directors and their
affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 35.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In particular, Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owned
approximately 27.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2012. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the
election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and
will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The
trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. Our shares of common stock began trading on
the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 29, 2010 and therefore, the trading history for our common stock has been limited. In addition, the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $75.77 per share and a low of $25.52 per share over the last 52 weeks. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in
particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of
companies stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following a securities offering. In addition, in the past,
following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us,
could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. A substantial
portion of our total outstanding shares are held by a small number of insiders and investors and may be sold in the near future. The large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale
could depress the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of
sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. Stockholders owning a substantial portion of our total
outstanding shares are entitled, under contracts providing for registration rights, to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the United States, subject to the restrictions of Rule 144. In addition, we
have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements, a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and,
in certain cases, lock-up agreements, the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market. Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to
registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares
of our common stock. Mr. Musk borrowed funds from an affiliate of our underwriter in our public offering in 2011
and pledged shares of our common stock to secure this borrowing. The forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business. In June 2011, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., made a loan in the amount of $35 million to Elon Musk
and the Elon Musk Revocable Trust dated July 22, 2003, or the Trust. Interest on the loan accrues at market rates. Goldman Sachs Bank USA received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with this loan. Goldman Sachs Bank USA
made additional extensions of credit in an aggregate amount of $50 million to Elon Musk and the Trust and Mr. Musk used a portion of the proceeds of such loans to purchase shares in our June 2011 private placement. Interest on the loans will
accrue at market rates. Goldman Sachs Bank USA received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans. As a regulated entity, Goldman Sachs Bank USA makes decisions regarding making and managing its loans independent of
Goldman, Sachs & Co. Mr. Musk and Goldman have a long-standing relationship of almost a decade. In addition, in May 2011, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC made a loan to Mr. Musk in the amount of $12 million. We are not a
party to these loans, which are full recourse against Mr. Musk and the Trust and are secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated
entities owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust. The terms of these loans were negotiated directly between Mr. Musk and Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. If the price of our common stock declines, Mr. Musk may be forced by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and/or Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC
to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans. The loans between Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
LLC on the one hand, and Mr. Musk and the Trust on the other hand, prohibit the non-pledged shares currently owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust from being pledged to secure any other loans. In addition, our DOE Loan Facility requires

Mr. Musk and certain of his affiliates, until one year after we complete the project relating to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of the Tesla capital stock held by them as of the
date of the DOE Loan Facility, and a failure to comply would be an event of default that could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the DOE Loan Facility documents and the exercise of other remedies by the DOE. These factors may limit
Mr. Musks ability to either pledge additional shares of Tesla common stock or sell shares of Tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged Tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our
stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call. Any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could
impair a takeover attempt. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could
have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions: 

 

 
 creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms; 

 

 
 authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting,
liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; 

 

 
 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; 

 

 
 limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings; 

 

 
 requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for
election to our board of directors; 

 

 
 controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings; and 

 

 
 providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special
meetings. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in
control or changes in our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of
our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect
of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
If securities or industry analysts publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market change their
recommendations regarding our stock adversely or cease to publish research or reports about us, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that
industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations
about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could
cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable
future. We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.
Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common
stock.

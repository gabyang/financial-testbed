NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related interim statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and
stockholders equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation 2012 Form 10-K filed on
July 26, 2012 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Principles of Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. Equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through
which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our
reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of
assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and
assumptions. Recasting of Certain Prior Period Information We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, including the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from retained earnings to a
separate component of stockholders equity, the reclassification of cost of revenue from operating expenses to a separate line and the addition of a gross profit line in the income statements, and the recasting of segment information for
immaterial movements of business activities between segments and changes in cost allocations, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. Recent Accounting Guidance Recently adopted accounting
guidance In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on testing goodwill for
impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines
that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if
any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance
did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive
income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income (OCI) and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a
continuous statement of net income and OCI or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.

PART I
Item 1

Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related
arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and
the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and
securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional
disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. In February 2013, the FASB issued
guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of AOCI. This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts
reclassified out of AOCI. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary
or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation
of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:

Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods
presented. In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible into shares of our common
stock. As of March 31, 2013, none of these securities were included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they would have been anti-dilutive. See Note 11  Debt for additional information.

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized
losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of
March 31, 2013.

and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $380 million and $313 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary
impairment. It is not possible for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. Debt Investment Maturities

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance
investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs
include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. currency equivalents. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to
foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for
up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. As of March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012, the total notional
amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $4.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. Foreign currency risks related to
certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts sold were $622 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging
instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of March 31, 2013, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.6 billion and $7.3 billion,
respectively. Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to
broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity
derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of March 31, 2013, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were both $1.1 billion. As of
June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $982 million, respectively.

Item 1

Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that
correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of March 31, 2013, the total
notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and
$1.9 billion, respectively. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to
gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of March 31, 2013 and
June 30, 2012, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual
credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of March 31, 2013, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $362 million and $466 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of credit
contracts purchased and sold were $318 million and $456 million, respectively. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities,
including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of March 31, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.3 billion and $284 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total
notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.5 billion and $445 million, respectively. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding
long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard
convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of March 31, 2013, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value
of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as
fair-value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in
the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments
designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options
designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.

Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair
values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the
underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from AOCI into other income (expense). The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (designated hedge
derivatives) and not designated as hedging instruments (non-designated hedge derivatives). The fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists
and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:

We estimate that $108 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at March 31, 2013 will be reclassified
into earnings within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013.
Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses) Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of
gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity
contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.

NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are: 

 

 
 Level 1inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments
primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. 

 

 
 Level 2inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot
prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Our Level 2 derivative
assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 

 

 
 Level 3inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in certain
corporate bonds and goodwill when it is recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. We value the Level 3 corporate bonds using internally developed valuation models, inputs to which include interest rate curves, credit spreads, stock
prices, and volatilities. Our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise derivatives for foreign equities. In certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and we use management judgment to develop assumptions to
determine fair value for these derivatives. Unobservable inputs used in all of these models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments
are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current
financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.

Yammer On July 18,
2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc. (Yammer), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. Yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to
Microsofts portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. We assigned the goodwill to the
Microsoft Business Division. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.

The measurement periods for purchase price allocations end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances
becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as other in the above table. Also
included within other are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

 In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt outstanding.  

*
 Not applicable.  Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term
debt, including the current portion, was $55 million and $56 million, respectively. Notes The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. Convertible Debt In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal
amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt
agreement. As of March 31, 2013, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.25 billion and the unamortized discount was $4 million. The notes are convertible at any time. If converted, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of
our common stock, at our election. Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to
separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated
between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.

Item 1

In connection with issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain
option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we
purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap
price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded in stockholders equity.
NOTE 12  INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate was approximately 20% for both the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, and 19% and 20% for
the nine months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing
our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates. Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.1 billion and $7.6 billion as of March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase
primarily relates to transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years.
In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of March 31, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our
financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining
open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2012. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local
tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.

NOTE 14  CONTINGENCIES
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC
operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the United States. All settlements in the United States have received final court approval. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of
platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on
the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The actual costs of these
settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9
billion and $2.0 billion. At March 31, 2013, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $500 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.4 billion
mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses. The three cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada
have not been settled. In March 2010, the court in the British Columbia case certified it as a class action. In April 2011, the British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding that
indirect purchasers do not have a claim. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, which was heard in the fall of 2012. The other two actions have been stayed. Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims In November 2004, Novell, Inc. (Novell)
filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (later transferred to federal court in Maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novells ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity
applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. In June 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of Novells six claims. In March 2010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft as to
all remaining claims. The court of appeals reversed that ruling as to one claim. Trial of that claim took place from October to December 2011 and resulted in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. In July 2012, the trial court
granted Microsofts motion for judgment as a matter of law. Novell has appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Government Competition Law Matters In
December 2009, the European Commission adopted a decision that rendered legally binding commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commissions concerns about the inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows. Among other things,
Microsoft committed to display a Browser Choice Screen on Windows-based PCs in Europe where Internet Explorer is set as the default browser. Due to a technical error, we failed to deliver the requisite software to enable that display to
PCs that came preinstalled with a version of Windows 7 called Windows 7

Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

Service Pack 1. We did deliver the requisite software to PCs running the original version of Windows 7 and earlier editions of Windows. Following notification by the Commission of reports that
some PCs were not receiving the update, we promptly fixed the error and advised the Commission of what we had discovered. PCs that come preinstalled with Windows 7 Service Pack 1 are now receiving the Browser Choice Screen software, as
intended. After conducting an investigation and issuing a Statement of Objections in October 2012, the Commission concluded that Microsoft failed to comply with the 2009 commitments and imposed a fine of 561 million (approximately $733 million) on March 6, 2013. We will not appeal the fine. The amount was included in other current
liabilities as of March 31, 2013. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims Motorola Litigation In October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against
Motorola Mobility (Motorola) with the International Trade Commission (ITC) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorolas Android devices. Since then, Microsoft and
Motorola have filed additional claims against each other in the ITC, in federal district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany and the United Kingdom. In April 2012, following complaints by Microsoft and
Apple, the European Unions competition office opened two antitrust investigations against Motorola to determine whether it has abused certain of its standard essential patents to distort competition in breach of European Union antitrust rules.
In June 2012, we received a request for information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) apparently related to an FTC investigation into whether Motorolas conduct violates U.S. law. The nature of the claims asserted and
status of individual matters are summarized below. International Trade Commission The hearing in Microsofts ITC case against Motorola took place in August 2011 on seven of the nine patents originally asserted in the
complaint. In December 2011, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an initial determination that Motorola infringed one Microsoft patent, and recommended that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order against Motorola prohibiting
importation of infringing Motorola Android devices. In May 2012, the ITC issued the limited exclusion order recommended by the ALJ, which became effective on July 18, 2012. Microsoft has appealed certain aspects of the ITC ruling adverse to
Microsoft and Motorola has appealed the ITC exclusion order. In November 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft in the ITC
alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing Xbox products into the U.S. In April 2012, the ALJ found that Xbox products infringe
four of the five patents asserted by Motorola. The ALJ recommended that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order. Both Microsoft and Motorola sought ITC review of the ALJs findings. In June 2012, Microsoft filed a
motion to terminate the investigation as to certain patents based on facts arising as the result of Googles acquisition of Motorola. The ITC determined that it would review the ALJs initial determination in its entirety and remanded the
matter to the ALJ (1) to apply certain ITC case precedent, (2) to rule on Microsofts June 2012 motion to terminate, and (3) set a new target date for completion of the investigation. The ALJ held a hearing in December 2012
and has set a target date for a final ITC ruling in July 2013. At Motorolas request, the ITC has terminated its investigation as to four Motorola patents, leaving only one Motorola patent at issue before the ITC. In March 2013, the ALJ ruled
that there has been no violation as to this last Motorola patent. Motorola is expected to seek ITC review of the ALJs determination. If the ITC rejects the ALJs ruling and issues an exclusion order or cease and desist order, it will be
subject to Presidential review for up to 60 days, during which Microsoft may be able to import Xbox products subject to posting a bond. If an order is issued and survives Presidential review, Microsoft may be able to mitigate the orders
impact by altering Xbox products to avoid Motorolas infringement claims. U.S. District Court The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsofts ITC case against Motorola has been stayed
pending the outcome of Microsofts ITC case. In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District
Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these
patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In suits described below, Motorola or

Item 1

a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In February 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary
judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling that (1) Motorola entered into binding contractual commitments with standards organizations committing to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms and conditions; and (2) Microsoft is a
third-party beneficiary of those commitments. The court rejected Motorolas argument that Microsoft had repudiated its right to a RAND license, and ruled a trial is needed to determine whether Motorola is in breach of its obligation to enter
into a patent license with Microsoft and, if so, the amount of the RAND royalty. In April 2012, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing Motorola from taking steps to enforce an injunction in Germany relating to the H.264 video
patents. In May 2012, the court converted that order into a preliminary injunction. Motorola appealed the courts injunction orders to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the orders in September 2012. The
Seattle District Court held a trial in November 2012 to determine the RAND royalty for Motorolas H.264 and 802.11 patents. In December 2012, the Seattle District Court ruled that Motorola could not obtain injunctive relief in connection with
any of its claims for infringement of its H.264 and 802.11 patents. Trial of Microsofts breach of contract claim is set for August 26, 2013. Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in Wisconsin (a companion case to Motorolas ITC action), have been transferred to the U.S
District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. No trial dates have been set in any of the transferred cases, and the court has stayed these cases on agreement of the parties. 

 

 
 In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by many Microsoft products including Windows Mobile 6.5 and Windows Phone 7, Windows
Marketplace, Silverlight, Windows Vista and Windows 7, Exchange Server 2003 and later, Exchange ActiveSync, Windows Live Messenger, Lync Server 2010, Outlook 2010, Office 365, SQL Server, Internet Explorer 9, Xbox, and Kinect.


 

 
 In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts that Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection with Microsofts assertion
of patents against Motorola that Microsoft has agreed to license to certain qualifying entities on RAND terms and conditions. 

 

 
 In counterclaims in the patent actions brought by Motorola, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola
digital video recorders. Germany In July 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries. 

 

 
 Two of the patents are asserted by Motorola to be essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products
including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. Motorola seeks damages and an injunction. In May 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable Microsoft products in Germany. However,
due to orders in the separate litigation pending in Seattle, Washington described above, Motorola is enjoined from taking steps to enforce the German injunction. Damages would be determined in later proceedings. Microsoft has appealed the rulings of
the first instance court. 

 

 
 Motorola asserts one of the patents covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail
Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. Motorola seeks damages and an injunction. If the court rules in favor of Motorola, an injunction could be issued immediately relating to these products employing the ActiveSync protocol
in Germany, which Motorola could then take steps to enforce. We expect the court to issue a ruling in April 2013. If Motorola prevails, damages would be determined in later proceedings. 

 

 
 Should injunction orders be issued and enforced by Motorola, Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact by altering its products to avoid
Motorolas infringement claims. In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in September, October, and December 2011
and in April 2012, Microsoft asserts Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft patents. Microsoft seeks damages and an injunction. In May, July, and September 2012, courts in Germany issued injunctions on three patents against Motorola Android
devices and in May and July ruled against Microsoft on two patents. Microsoft is taking steps to enforce the injunctions. Damages will be determined in later proceedings. Each party has appealed or is expected to appeal the rulings against it.

PART I
Item 1

United Kingdom In December 2011, Microsoft filed an action against Motorola in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, in London, England, seeking to revoke the UK part of the European patent asserted by
Motorola in Germany against the ActiveSync protocol. In February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. A trial took place in December 2012, and the court ruled that Motorolas
patent is invalid and revoked. The court also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in Googles ActiveSync license. Motorola has appealed. Other Patent and Intellectual Property Claims In addition to these cases, there are
approximately 65 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft. Other We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management
currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters
may change in the future. As of March 31, 2013, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $419 million in other current liabilities
and $176 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $450 million in
aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable.

NOTE 16  SEGMENT INFORMATION
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the companys Chief Executive
Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information within this note is reported on that basis. Our five segments are
Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we changed the name of our Windows & Windows Live
Division to Windows Division. Due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue earned and costs incurred by one segment
may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain contracts may be allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. Costs that are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to incent
cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity. Allocated costs may include those relating to development and marketing of products and services from which multiple
segments benefit, or those costs relating to services performed by one segment on behalf of other segments. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated
costs include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain other
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities;
research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance. We have recast certain prior period amounts
within this note to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, reflecting immaterial movements of business activities between segments and changes in cost allocations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation Redmond, Washington We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of March 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
March 31, 2013 and 2012. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporations management. We
conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such consolidated interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income,
cash flows, and stockholders equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 26, 2012 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2012 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

OVERVIEW
The following managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is
provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology
that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices. We generate revenue by developing,
licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling hardware that integrates with our cloud-based services, and by
delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic
and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At
Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. Key Opportunities and Investments We
invest research and development resources in new products and services in the areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth. As we look forward, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other
devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. With this trend, we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal
lives. Devices with end-user services We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. In some cases, we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Surface. In all our work with partners and on our
own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique
communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers around the world.

Windows 8 reflects this shift. Launched in October 2012 on a variety of state-of-the-art
hardware, Windows 8 is built to take advantage of our consumer cloud services. Windows 8 is made for both personal and professional use and unites the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. For example, Xbox Music,
Video, Games, and SmartGlass applications make it possible to select and experience entertainment across a range of devices by simplifying and increasing the accessibility of those experiences. SkyDrive, our cloud storage solution, connects content
across all of a users devices. Bings search technologies in Windows 8 are designed to help users get more done. Skype has a new Windows 8 application and connects directly to the new Office. The new Office is designed for Windows 8 and takes advantage of new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. It unlocks new experiences
for reading, note taking, meetings, and communications and brings social experiences directly into productivity and collaboration scenarios. The combination of a Windows 8 tablet with OneNote and SkyDrive will transform how to take notes, annotate
documents, and share information. Services for the enterprise Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprise IT departments are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more
productive, collaborative, and satisfied. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate
devices. To address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office,
Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to
realize the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. Cloud-based solutions
provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy
computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and
network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. Because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. For
businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. Unique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on-premise assets however best suits their own needs. For example, a company can
choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premises, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure, and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a
partners datacenter, or in Microsofts datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our business customers tell us these hybrid capabilities are
critical to harnessing the power of the cloud so they can reach new levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth. Our future opportunity
There are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these
areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. We are investing significant resources in: 

 

 
 Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gesture, and speech. 

 

 
 Making technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command, with machine learning. 

 

 
 Building and running cloud services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.


 
 Firmly establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device
user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market. 

 

 
 Delivering new scenarios with improvements in how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another. We believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing Windows ecosystem
position us to be a leader in these areas. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for
growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. We prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year
in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering
broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation. Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong
correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q). Seasonality Our revenue historically has
fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division
is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue
in our second fiscal quarter. Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on: sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price
(the Windows Upgrade Offer); sales of the previous version of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new Office at minimal or no cost (the Office Upgrade Offer) and pre-sales of the new Office to
OEMs and retailers before general availability (Office Pre-Sales) (collectively, the Office Deferral); and on sales of video games with the right to receive specified software upgrades/enhancements (the Video Game
Deferral).

Windows Division develops and markets PC operating systems, related software, and online
services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the users hardware and software. Windows Division offerings consist of the
Windows operating system, software, and services, Surface, and Microsoft PC hardware products. The general availability of Surface RT and Windows 8 started on October 26, 2012. The general availability of Surface Pro started on February 9,
2013. Excluding the impact of the Windows Deferral, approximately 65% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating
system software purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows, Surface, PC hardware products, and online advertising. Windows Division revenue increased, due mainly to the recognition of $1.1 billion of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Revenue from
Surface and increased commercial sales of Windows was offset by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market. OEM revenue grew 17%, reflecting the revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, offset in part by the impact on revenue of a
decline in the x86 PC market. Windows Division operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher
cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $306 million or 65%, reflecting product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8. Sales and marketing expenses increased $291 million or 43%, reflecting advertising costs
associated with Windows 8 and Surface. Windows Division revenue increased, due mainly to the recognition of $540 million of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Revenue from
Surface, increased commercial sales of Windows, and Windows 8 upgrades, were largely offset by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market. OEM revenue decreased 4%, reflecting the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market and
continued higher relative growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets, offset in part by the revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Windows Division operating income decreased, primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue, offset in part by revenue
growth. Sales and marketing expenses increased $659 million or 30%, reflecting advertising costs associated with Windows 8 and Surface. Cost of revenue increased $598 million or 41%, reflecting product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8.

Online Services Division (OSD) develops and markets information and content designed to help people
simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and to help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, and advertiser tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display
advertising, accounting for nearly all of OSDs annual revenue. Three months ended March 31, 2013 compared with three months ended
March 31, 2012 Online advertising revenue grew $143 million or 22% to $784 million, reflecting continued growth in search
advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue. Search revenue grew, primarily due to increased revenue per search. According to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share for the month of March 2013 was
approximately 17%, and grew 160 basis points year over year. Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo!) properties, was approximately 26% for the month of March 2013, which grew 20 basis points year over year.
OSDs operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue
decreased $65 million, driven by lower traffic acquisition costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $31 million or 15%, due mainly to decreased advertising and corporate sales and marketing activities. Online advertising revenue grew $336 million or 17% to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by

Microsoft Business Division (MBD) develops and markets software and online services designed to
increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics
business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue;
and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue. Three months ended March 31, 2013 compared
with three months ended March 31, 2012 MBD revenue increased, due to overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system,
as well as the recognition of $101 million of revenue related to Office Pre-Sales and a net $92 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer. Business revenue increased $477 million or 10%, reflecting growth in multi-year volume
licensing revenue and a 13% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue was flat, reflecting the recognition of revenue related to the Office Deferral, offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market.
MBD revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2013 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $114 million. MBD operating income increased, due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses
increased $126 million or 13%, primarily due to increased advertising, fees paid to third-party software advisors, and cross-platform marketing activities. MBD
revenue decreased, due to the deferral of a net $784 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer, offset in part by overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $816 million or 6%, reflecting
growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and an 11% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 32%, driven by the deferral of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer and the impact on revenue of a
decline in the x86 PC market. MBD revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact
of $336 million. MBD operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by
lower research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $98 million or 3%, primarily due to higher fees paid to third-party software advisors and increased advertising. Research and development expenses decreased $76 million
or 5%, primarily due to the capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs, offset in part by increased headcount-related expenses. Entertainment and Devices Division

Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD) develops and markets products and services
designed to entertain and connect people. EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories),
Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), Skype, and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. We acquired Skype on October 13, 2011, and its results of operations from that date are reflected in our results
discussed below. EDD revenue increased, primarily due to higher Xbox 360 platform and Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue increased $641 million or
55%, primarily due to the recognition of $380 million of revenue related to the Video Game Deferral and higher Xbox LIVE revenue. Windows Phone revenue increased $259 million, including patent licensing revenue and increased sales of Windows Phone
licenses. EDD operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue and research and
development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $275 million or 23%, due mainly to increased royalties on Xbox LIVE content and video games. Research and development expenses increased $113 million or 28%, primarily reflecting higher
headcount-related expenses. EDD revenue increased, due to higher Windows Phone and Skype revenue, offset in part by lower Xbox 360 platform revenue. Windows Phone revenue
increased $948 million, including patent licensing revenue and higher sales of Windows Phone licenses. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $864 million or 13%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue.
We shipped 8.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2013, compared with 11.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2012. EDD operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, lower sales and marketing expenses, and lower cost of revenue, offset in part by
higher research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $126 million or 15%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 platform marketing. Cost of revenue decreased $117 million or 2%, due mainly to lower sales of Xbox 360
consoles, offset in part by payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and increased royalties on Xbox LIVE content. Research and development expenses increased $351 million or 32%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related
expenses. Corporate-Level Activity

Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and
marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; costs of operating our retail stores; and legal settlements and contingencies.
Corporate-level expenses increased, due to higher legal charges from a European Commission fine of 561 million (approximately $733 million) for failure to comply with our 2009 agreement to display a Browser Choice Screen on
Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser (the EU fine). Corporate-level expenses also increased due to higher intellectual property licensing costs and retail stores expenses.

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold, including Xbox and Surface, and
programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space
(traffic acquisition costs); costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and
the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. Cost of revenue increased, reflecting product costs associated with
Surface and Windows 8, higher headcount-related expenses, royalties on Xbox LIVE content and video games, and higher intellectual property licensing costs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2013, cost of revenue also increased due to payments
made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, offset in part by lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Headcount-related expenses increased 15% and 13% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, respectively, primarily
related to increased Server and Tools headcount.

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and
credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of
other comprehensive income (OCI) until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) into other income (expense).
Net losses on derivatives decreased, due to lower losses on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge foreign currency revenues. Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities, offset in part by lower
other-than-temporary impairments. Net losses on derivatives decreased, due mainly to gains on commodity and equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period. For the nine months ended March 31, 2013, other
includes a gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was approximately 20% for both the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, and 19% and 20% for the nine months
ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the

U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign
regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates. The effective tax rate for three
months ended March 31, 2013 was unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2012. The tax effect of the EU fine, which is not tax deductible, was offset primarily by the favorable impact of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign
jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was lower for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2012, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and the favorable impact
of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our foreign tax provisions, offset in part by the tax effect of the EU fine. Tax
contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.1 billion and $7.6 billion as of March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase primarily relates to transfer pricing
developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew
its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of March 31, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved
favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within
the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2012. We are subject to income
tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not
expected to be material to our financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $74.5 billion as of March 31, 2013, compared with $63.0 billion as of June 30,
2012. Equity and other investments were $11.2 billion as of March 31, 2013, compared with $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist
predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated
securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to
certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and
asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2013 does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our
mortgage-backed securities is collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carries a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National
Mortgage Association. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our
gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material. Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2013, approximately $66 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount
of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $970 million. As of March 31, 2013,
approximately 85% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 6% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 2% were
invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on
our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset
with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable

balance was $564 million as of March 31, 2013. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $404 million and $632 million,
respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 were $474 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are due mainly to
fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our
Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value,
then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds,
foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an
immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2
investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the
investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker
prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for
these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations decreased $1.0 billion to $22.9 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2013, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets.
Cash used in financing decreased $308 million to $6.7 billion, due mainly to $2.2 billion in proceeds from issuance of debt, offset in part by an $870 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, an $827 million increase in
dividends paid, and a $319 million increase in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $2.2 billion to $18.0 billion, due mainly to an $8.0 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and intangible
and other assets, offset in part by a $4.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales and a $780 million increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment. Debt We issued debt in prior periods to
take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions,
share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2013, the total carrying value and estimated fair value
of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14.2 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. These
estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

 In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt outstanding. Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of March 31, 2013, the
aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $55 million. Notes The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. Convertible debt In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal
amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt
agreement. As of March 31, 2013, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.25 billion and the unamortized discount was $4 million. The notes are convertible at any time. If converted, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of
our common stock, at our election. Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to
separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated
between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.

In connection with issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain
option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we
purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap
price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded in stockholders equity. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue at
March 31, 2013 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or
annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at March 31, 2013 also included payments for: post-delivery support
and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; the Office Upgrade Offer deferral; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; OEM minimum commitments;
and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of March 31, 2013:

Item 2

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material
impact on our financial statements during the periods presented. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to
property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales
and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital
resources. Liquidity We earn a
significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from
operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at
least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating
activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could
elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We
have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING
GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill
impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its
carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report OCI and its
components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and OCI or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted this new guidance
beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.

PART I
Item 2

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related
arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and
the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and
securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional
disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. In February 2013, the FASB issued
guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of AOCI. This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts
reclassified out of AOCI. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary
or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation
of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities,
goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Revenue Recognition Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether
vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify
VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or
upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Windows 7 revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer,
which started June 2, 2012. The offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchase Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft is responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to
the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires. Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Office Upgrade Offer, which started October 19, 2012. The Office Upgrade Offer allows customers who purchase qualifying 2010 Microsoft
Office system or Office for Mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to Office 365 Home Premium or the equivalent version of 2013 Microsoft Office system upon general availability. Small business customers in applicable
markets will also be eligible for a three-month trial of Office 365 Small Business Premium. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 Microsoft Office system and subscription services is deferred until the products and services
are delivered or the redemption period expires.

Item 2

Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this
judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among
other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For
fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial
health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment
charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting
units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant
portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting
units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow
methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which
cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a
reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting
unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is
established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological
feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs
is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency
such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required
if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable
estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.

Item 2, 3

Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax
positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences
could materially impact our financial statements. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of
stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to
economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted
transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency
positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit
risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the
securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment
portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.

VALUE-AT-RISK
We use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements
over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that
will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and
legal risk. The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of March 31, 2013 and
June 30, 2012 and for the three months ended March 31, 2013:

Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $362 million at March 31, 2013 and $292 million at
June 30, 2012. The total VaR is 24% less at March 31, 2013, and 26% less at June 30, 2012, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are
effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Item 1A

We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue
or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in
deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and software products can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly
with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products that appeal to businesses and consumers.
Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among
users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain competitive margins. The strategic importance of developing and maintaining a
vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8 operating system, Surface, Windows Phone, and associated cloud-based services. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.


 

 
 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has been
successful with some consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones, gaming consoles, and digital music players. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services that are integrated with the hardware and software
platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors in smartphones and tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Efforts to compete with the vertically integrated
model will increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. 

 

 
 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face substantial competitive challenges from competing
platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these
devices to perform functions that would have been performed by personal computers in the past. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract
applications developers to our platforms. In addition, Surface competes with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. 

 

 
 Competing platforms have applications marketplaces (sometimes referred to as stores) with scale and significant installed bases on mobile devices.
These applications leverage free and user-paid services that over time result in disincentives for users to switch to competing platforms. In order to compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and
ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with these application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Business model competition Companies
compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. 

 

 
 Under the license-based proprietary software model that generates most of our revenue, we bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products
through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model and we expect this
competition to continue. 

 

 
 Other competitors develop and offer free online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenues fund development
of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.






50


Table of Contents
PART II
Item 1A


 
 Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users and
earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality
of our products. The competitive pressures described above may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions,
and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on devices and services presents execution and competitive risks.    A growing part of our strategy involves cloud-based services used with smart client devices. Our
competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the
users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based strategies. While we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of
our cloud-based services provide us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. In addition to software development costs, we are incurring
costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of
areas, including: 

 

 
 continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share; 

 

 
 maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,
tablets, and television-related devices; 

 

 
 continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers; and 

 

 
 ensuring that our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.
We make significant investments in new products and services that may not be
profitable.    We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system,
Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Windows Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox 360 entertainment platform. We will continue to invest in new software and hardware products,
services, and technologies, such as the Microsoft-designed and manufactured Surface launched in October 2012. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and
effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue.
We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins
for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. In October 2012, we launched
Windows 8, a major new release of our PC operating system, and Surface, which seek to deliver a unique user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. Their success depends on a number of factors including the extent
to which customers embrace the new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our OEM partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of new features, and attracting developers at scale to ensure a
competitive array of quality applications. The marketing costs we are incurring to promote Windows 8 and associated services and devices may reduce our operating margins. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.    Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software
and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. As
a result, our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying PC market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we actively educate
consumers

Item 1A

about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where
intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.    From time to time, we receive notices from
others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate
of issuance of new patents and our offering of Microsoft-branded services and hardware devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available,
stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. In addition to money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs
can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully
litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as
part of our strategy to manage this risk. We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized
disclosure of source code.    Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system
source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade
secret protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could
increase the security risks described in the next paragraph. Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased
costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. Security of Microsofts information technology Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers. Threats to information technology
(IT) security can take a variety of forms. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. Groups of hackers may
also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks. Sophisticated organizations, individuals, or governments launch targeted attacks to gain access to our network. Breaches of our network
or data security could disrupt and compromise the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,
compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of
sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. These practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that
our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes. Security of our customers products and
services Security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. The
threats to our own IT infrastructure also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their
efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect them to continue to do so. The security of our products and services is an important consideration in our customers purchasing
decisions.

Item 1A

We devote significant resources to defend against security threats, both to our internal IT
systems and those of our customers. These include: 

 

 
 engineering more secure products and services; 

 

 
 enhancing security and reliability features in our products and services, and continuously evaluating and updating those security and reliability features;


 

 
 improving the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities; 

 

 
 investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed; 

 

 
 protecting the digital security infrastructure that ensures the integrity of our products and services; 

 

 
 helping our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks; and 

 

 
 providing customers online automated security tools, published security guidance, and security software such as firewalls and anti-virus software.
The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual or perceived security
vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also
increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived
vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.
Legislative or regulatory action may increase the costs to develop or implement our products and services. Improper disclosure of
personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.    As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable
information of our customers. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. This environment demands that we continuously improve
our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. Despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices
we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us
to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based
environment we host. We believe consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data.
Perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of our cloud-based solutions. We may experience outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations
infrastructure.    Our increasing user traffic and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers
and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office
365, SharePoint Online, SkyDrive, Skype, Xbox LIVE, Windows Azure, Outlook, and Microsoft Office Web Apps. We also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end
customers. Maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user
experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial
condition. We are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that may limit how we design and market our
products.    As a leading global software maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers
to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, we were sued on competition law grounds by the U.S.

Item 1A

Department of Justice, 18 states, and the District of Columbia in the late 1990s. The resolution of the government lawsuits imposed various constraints on our Windows operating system businesses.
These constraints included limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain Windows features in new PCs.
Although these constraints expired in May 2011, we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business. The European Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and
protocols, available to other companies. In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain
proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commissions concerns relating to competition in Web browsing software and an
undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. These obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product
development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and
businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated at any time. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in
a variety of ways, including: 

 

 
 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products
to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 

 

 
 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our
associated intellectual property. 

 

 
 The rulings described above may be used as precedent in other competition law proceedings. 

 

 
 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments as a result of court or administrative orders, consent decrees or other voluntary actions we have taken. If
we fail to comply with these commitments we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. For example, in July 2012, we announced that, for some PCs sold in Europe, we were not in compliance with our 2009
agreement to display a Browser Choice Screen on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser. As a result, the European Commission imposed a fine of 561 million (approximately $733 million). Our products and online
services offerings, including new technologies we develop or acquire such as Skype, are subject to government regulation in some jurisdictions, including in areas of user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. The
application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally these laws and governments approach to their enforcement, as
well as our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in
penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Our business depends on our ability to
attract and retain talented employees.    Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are
limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and
services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and
execution. Delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue.    The development of
software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Our increasing focus on devices and cloud-based services also presents new and complex
development issues. Significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.

Item 1A

Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our
business.    Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand
for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network.
OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could result in sales channel
disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We
maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial
markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio consists of U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if there is a downgrade of U.S. government debt, our investment portfolio
may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    We are subject to a variety of claims and
lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent
uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and
reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities.    We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.
and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions
to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.
Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as the Xbox 360 console, Surface, and other hardware
devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues
through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available
to us. If a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Either component shortages or excess or
obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox 360 consoles and Surface are assembled in Asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to
any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. Our stand-alone software products also may experience
quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could result in
reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our
exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.

Item 1A

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record
a significant charge to earnings.    We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. Under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at
least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced
future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is
determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. For example, in July 2012, we announced a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our Online Services Division business segment. We operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.    We operate in over 100 countries and a significant
part of our revenue comes from international sales. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries. Operations outside the U.S.
may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws (Anti-Corruption Laws) prohibit corrupt
payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented certain policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, if we fail
to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws, we may be exposed to significant fines and penalties. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks.
Deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, such as current uncertainties relating to European economic weakness, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, may also adversely
affect our operations or financial results. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenue.
Catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.    A disruption or failure of our
systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. Our corporate
headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of
California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business
operations. Our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of
prolonged service outages on our operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may
add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate
change on the global economy in general or the information technology industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and
services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.    We expect to
continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business
strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that the transaction diverts managements attention from our other
businesses. Our acquisition of Skype, for example, provides opportunities to enhance our existing products. The success of our integration of Skype will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our
competitors in both consumer and business markets. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or those benefits may ultimately
be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE
1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles We prepare our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management,
the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative
of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation 2016 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on
July 28, 2016. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on
consolidated net income or cash flows. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to
exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant
influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and
Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles;
useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions
include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools;
video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as
Office 365, Microsoft Azure (Azure), Microsoft Dynamics (Dynamics) CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising.

Item 1

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments  Credit Losses In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and
supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing
credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the
securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the
recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the
new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases at the
beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The new standard will be effective for us beginning
July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue standard. Our ability to early adopt is dependent on
system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential
impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office, retail, and datacenter operating leases. Financial Instruments  Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial
instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income (OCI). The
new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of
this standard on our consolidated financial statements. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains
control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount,
timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying
performance obligations. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full
retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using
the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented. The new standard will be effective for us beginning
July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017. Our

ability to early adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of
information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software license revenue. We expect revenue related to
hardware, cloud offerings, and professional services to remain substantially unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing rather than ratably over the life of the
related device. We also expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather than over the subscription period from certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both software licenses and Software Assurance. Due to
the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some instances from recognition at the
time of billing. We currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change
in revenue we expect from the adoption of the new standard.
NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares
include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the recorded bases of common and preferred
stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $802 million and $767 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is
not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to
increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for
the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the collateral received under agreements for loaned securities
totaled $210 million and $294 million, which is primarily comprised of U.S. government and agency securities. Unrealized Losses on Investments

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized
losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for
holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted
transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to
hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian
dollar. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.5 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are
designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain
balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of September 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $8.6 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. As of
June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. Equity Securities held in our equity and
other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of September 30, 2016, the total notional
amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016,
the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.
Interest Rate Securities held
in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices
using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of September 30, 2016, the total

13


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $327 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate
contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward
purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available
delivery date. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $546 million and $548 million, respectively. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade
securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost
method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of September 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $384 million and $271 million, respectively. As of June 30,
2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities,
including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of September 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $623 million and $195 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the
total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent
Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the
standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of September 30, 2016, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and
the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in
the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses)
on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which
are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) into other income (expense), net.

We estimate that $289 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at September 30, 2016 will be
reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during the three months ended
September 30, 2016.

Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses) Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense),
net. These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign
exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts.

NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which
inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
These levels are: 

 

 
 Level 1inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments
primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. 

 

 
 Level 2inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities,
and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 

 

 
 Level 3inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and
preferred stock, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and
discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.

(a)
 These amounts represent the impact of netting derivative assets and derivative liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and
fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk.  The changes in our Level 3
financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on

NOTE 10  DEBT
Short-term Debt As of September 30, 2016, we had $14.5 billion of commercial paper
issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.55% and maturities ranging from 47 days to 187 days. As of June 30, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate
of 0.43% and maturities ranging from 1 day to 99 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 1, 2016 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities
serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented. Long-term Debt As of September 30,
2016, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $60.2 billion and $64.0 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $40.6 billion
and $44.0 billion, respectively. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid
annually. Effective July 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As of September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016, the combined aggregate unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt were $597 million and $392 million, respectively.

PART I
Item 1

NOTE 11  INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 12% and 11%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was
lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland,
Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase in our current quarter effective tax rate compared to prior year was primarily due to changes
in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, offset by an increase in the tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.3 billion and $11.8 billion as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This
increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing. While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years.
In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of September 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue
to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S.
Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated
financial statements.
NOTE 12  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Phone Hardware Restructuring In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our
phone business to better focus and align resources (the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses
and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially
complete as of June 30, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2016. 2016 Restructuring We periodically evaluate how to best deploy the companys resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved restructuring plans
that would result in job eliminations, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be reduced during
fiscal year 2017 as an extension of the earlier plan. These actions are expected to be completed by the end of the current fiscal year. In fiscal year 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in connection with the 2016 restructuring plans, including severance
expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur additional charges for these restructuring plans in subsequent years.

 As of September 30, 2016, capital leases included imputed interest of $410 million. As of September 30, 2016, we had additional purchase obligations for capital leases executed but not yet recorded of $5.0 billion. Other Commitments On June 11, 2016,
we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn Corporation (LinkedIn) for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash (the Merger Agreement). We will
finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Microsoft and LinkedIn, and has been approved by LinkedIns shareholders. We expect the
acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims IPCom patent litigation IPCom
GmbH & Co. (IPCom) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these
patents in litigation against Nokia Corporation (Nokia) and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against
Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions. InterDigital patent litigation InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, IDT) filed four patent infringement
cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission (ITC) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other
defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order
excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an inter partes
review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of
Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. That case is set for trial in September 2018.

incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (EU) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies
based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating it must pay levies not only based upon sales of
blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia were pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume
of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. We reached a settlement of the Austrian case in August 2016. In Germany, the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004-2007. In July, the German Supreme Court heard our
appeal contesting the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players and over five megabytes of memory. The Supreme Court vacated the lower courts ruling, and we are awaiting the Supreme Courts full opinion. We expect that
the case will be remanded for further proceedings to set an appropriate levy for the 2004-2007 period. Other patent and intellectual property claims
In addition to these cases, there were 58 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of September 30, 2016.
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired
licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010. The trial of the
British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The plaintiffs filed their case in chief in August 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support of their claims. A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in
September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive. Other Antitrust Litigation and
Claims China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation In 2014, Microsoft was informed that Chinas State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) had begun a formal
investigation relating to Chinas Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales,
file verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues. Product-Related Litigation U.S. cell phone litigation Nokia, along
with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors
and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of our acquisition of Nokias Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are
consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that
operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (FCC Guidelines) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were
manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in part
defendants motion to exclude

Item 1

plaintiffs general causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court
of Appeals agreed to hear en banc. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal. Canadian cell phone class action
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been
substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served. Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
managements view of these matters may change in the future. As of September 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities
of $443 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable
final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.
NOTE 15  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Share Repurchases On September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share
repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of
September 30, 2016, $3.5 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing an additional $40.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program will commence following completion of
the program approved on September 16, 2013, has no expiration, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. We
repurchased the following shares of common stock through our share repurchase program approved on September 16, 2013:

NOTE 17  SEGMENT
INFORMATION
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief
Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the
following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

27


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our
Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: 

 

 
 Office Commercial, including volume licensing and subscriptions to Office 365 commercial for products and services such as Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and
Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (CALs). 

 

 
 Office Consumer, including Office sold through retail or through an Office 365 consumer subscription, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype,
Outlook.com, and OneDrive. 

 

 
 Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP products, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics CRM Online. Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud
segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises: 

 

 
 Server products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, as well as Azure.


 

 
 Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. More Personal Computing Our More Personal
Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across screens of all sizes. This segment primarily comprises: 

 

 
 Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial,
comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Embedded; MSN display advertising; and Windows Phone licensing. 

 

 
 Devices, including Microsoft Surface, phones, and PC accessories. 

 

 
 Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising Xbox Live transactions, subscriptions, and advertising (Xbox Live),
video games, and third-party video game royalties. 

 

 
 Search advertising. Corporate and Other includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to U.S. GAAP, and impairment, integration, and restructuring
expenses. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to Windows 10 revenue recognition. Revenue and
costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain contracts is allocated
among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated
in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on
relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are
allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation Redmond, Washington We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. We
conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such consolidated interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash
flows, and stockholders equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 28, 2016 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Note About Forward-Looking Statements This report includes estimates, projections, statements
relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend,
strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and
similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results and events to differ materially in Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q), Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q), and
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because
of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help
the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016,
and our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Microsoft is a
technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We develop, license,
and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peoples lives. We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and
selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling
our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. Highlights from the first quarter
of fiscal year 2017 included: 

 

 
 Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate* exceeded $13 billion. 

 

 
 Office Commercial revenue grew 5%, driven by Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 51%.

 

 
 Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 24 million.

 

 
 Microsoft Dynamics (Dynamics) revenue grew 11%, driven by Dynamics CRM Online revenue growth.

 

 
 Server products and cloud services revenue grew 11%, driven by Microsoft Azure (Azure) revenue growth.

 

 
 Azure revenue grew 116%, with Azure compute usage more than doubling year-over-year.

 

 
 Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, grew 9%, driven by increased revenue per search and search
volume.

*
 Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by twelve for Office 365 commercial,
Azure, Dynamics online, and other cloud properties.  In June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire LinkedIn Corporation (LinkedIn) for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash (the Merger Agreement). We will finance the transaction primarily through
the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Microsoft and LinkedIn, and has been approved by LinkedIns shareholders. We expect the acquisition will close in calendar year
2016, subject to satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.

Item 2

In May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The
transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. In
July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy
to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower
range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely positioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in
fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an
opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that
seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions, Challenges,
and Risks The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are
developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some
cases, the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue
to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and
retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow
ones career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain
dynamic. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout
fiscal year 2016, and continuing into fiscal year 2017, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). Seasonality Our revenue historically has
fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Reportable Segments The segment amounts
included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 17Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) is also
presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included
in Corporate and Other.

Revenue increased $74 million, driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes,
offset in part by an increase in the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 and lower revenue from More Personal Computing. Windows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and
subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased, driven by
higher revenue from Office 365. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices and Gaming, offset in part by higher revenue from Search advertising. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.
Operating income decreased $568 million or 10%, primarily due to lower gross margin and an increase in research and development
expenses, offset in part by lower sales and marketing expenses. Operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5%. Gross margin decreased $563 million or 4%, driven by higher cost of revenue. Gross margin included an unfavorable
foreign currency impact of 2%. Key changes in expenses were: 

 

 
 Cost of revenue increased $637 million or 9%, mainly due to growth in our commercial cloud and Search advertising traffic acquisition costs, offset in part by
a reduction in phone sales. 

 

 
 Research and development expenses increased $144 million or 5%, primarily due to increased strategic investments and acquisitions to drive cloud engineering,
offset in part by a reduction in phone expenses. 

 

 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased $100 million or 3%, primarily due to a reduction in phone expenses and Windows 10 launch-related expenses in the prior
year, offset in part by increased investment to drive sales capacity in our commercial cloud. Diluted earnings per
share (EPS) was $0.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Current year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10, which resulted in a decrease to diluted EPS of $0.16. Diluted EPS was
$0.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10, which resulted in a decrease to diluted EPS of $0.09.

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and
credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than

Item 2

those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying
available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes. Dividends and
interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on
sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives decreased slightly due to lower losses on commodity and foreign currency derivatives compared to the prior year and gains on interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior year,
offset in part by losses on equity contracts as compared to gains in the prior year. Other reflects losses recognized from certain joint ventures for both periods presented, and prior year includes losses from divestitures.
INCOME TAXES
Our effective
tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 12% and 11%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase in our current quarter effective tax rate compared to prior year was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, offset by an increase
in the tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.3 billion and
$11.8 billion as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing. While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal
year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of September 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.
We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash
Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $136.9 billion as of September 30,
2016, compared with $113.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Equity and other investments were $10.5 billion as of September 30, 2016, compared with $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to
facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated
securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are
managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade
fixed-income securities. Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, 2016, $111.1 billion was
held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds
(primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 83% of the

37


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 2

cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 4% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of
U.S. companies, and approximately 4% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested
in foreign securities. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are
received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities
lending payable balance was $210 million as of September 30, 2016. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $514 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Intra-year
variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our
financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our
Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued
using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a
quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or
when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets
without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include
controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows Cash flows from
operations increased $2.7 billion to $11.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and unsettled cash equivalent investments in government securities as of quarter end.
Cash from financing increased $18.3 billion to $14.3 billion, mainly due to an $18.1 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $395 million decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a
$325 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $13.4 billion to $18.5 billion, mainly due to a $12.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and an $807 million increase in cash
used for additions to property and equipment, offset in part by a $366 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of
favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things,
funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 10  Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further
discussion.

Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2016 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year
licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of
September 30, 2016 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Dynamics business solutions products; Skype
prepaid credits and subscriptions; bundled products and services; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2016:

If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing
transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Share Repurchases On September 16,
2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or
discontinued at any time without notice. As of September 30, 2016, $3.5 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by December 31, 2016. On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing an additional $40.0 billion in share repurchases.
This share repurchase program will commence following completion of the program approved on September 16, 2013, has no expiration, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 63 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $3.6 billion under the share
repurchase program approved on September 16, 2013. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Dividends
See Note 15  Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability
of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.

Other Planned Uses of Capital In June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash. We expect the acquisition will close in calendar
year 2016, and we will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt. We will continue to invest in sales,
marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities,
datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating leases
for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect
liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Liquidity We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and
Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly
dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from
operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant
discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in
higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
See Note 1  Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further
discussion.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of
investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted
for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Judgment is also required to assess whether
future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for

40


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 2

current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized
as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the
definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is
deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a
hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price
(ESP). For software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price
established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables
were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. In January 2015, we announced Windows 10 would be free to all qualified existing users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This offer differs from
historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of Windows as it is being made available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. We evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the Windows 10
offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of Windows
8 will continue to be recognized as delivered. Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades
over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the
estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years. We currently are evaluating the impact of the new
standard related to revenue recognition, which we anticipate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1  Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form
10-Q) for further discussion. Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that
considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans
to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including
industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new
cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate
our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on
an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or

41

Item 2

circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the
business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units,
and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of
future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market
conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a
computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general
release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have
been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes
of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been
impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability
to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income
Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year
and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and
liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements
or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at
average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments
with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our
review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these
risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and
use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate Our fixed-income
portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain
global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of
global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
Commodity We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global
commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
VALUE-AT-RISK
We use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level,
in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange
rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss
that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and
legal risk.

Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $325 million as of September 30, 2016 and $225 million
as of June 30, 2016. The total VaR is 32% and 29% less as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of
risks.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
See Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services,
which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms
whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and
disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and
consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among
users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide
competing platforms, applications, and services. 

 

 
 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded
with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some
vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. 

 

 
 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms
developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to
perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to
our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their
commitment to our platform. 

 

 
 Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as stores) with scale and significant installed bases. The
variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must
successfully enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors content and application marketplaces may
increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.

Item 1A

Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. 

 

 
 Even as we transition to a mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear
the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to
businesses and consumers under this model. 

 

 
 Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue
funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. 

 

 
 Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and
earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality
of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions,
and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.    A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing
devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and
business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant
resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to
innovation. The Companys investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality,
and operational efficiency. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we
succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: 

 

 
 Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. 

 

 
 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,
tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices. 

 

 
 Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. 

 

 
 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. 

 

 
 Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are
not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure
and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. We make significant
investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.    We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies,
including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based offerings,

and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones,
and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings
as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and
distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have
experienced historically. The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, has been the most
ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We did extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. We also consistently promoted the
update to Windows 7 and 8.1 users. However, negative upgrade experiences could adversely affect the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace and may lead to litigation or regulatory actions by customers and government agencies. In
addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our inability to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our
revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use, and management in Windows 10 are subject to regulatory review, and may result in decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public
reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require
long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.    We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and
strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. In June 2016, we announced our acquisition of LinkedIn for approximately $26.2 billion. The LinkedIn acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges
and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from
our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will
depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased
revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to
earnings.    We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the
carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we
participate. We may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of
operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we
recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. Our acquisition of LinkedIn will result in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset
balances. We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the
impact on revenue

Item 1A

from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the
underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining
indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property
rights could adversely affect revenue. We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating
that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for
licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail
to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price
changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Third parties may claim we infringe
their intellectual property rights.    From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we
compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing
agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to
decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany,
an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure
intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. We may not be able to protect
our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we
license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose
future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code
also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph. Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to
reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. Security of Microsofts information technology
Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including
state-sponsored organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our
products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly
evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and
customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product
development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies,
or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Item 1A

In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new
devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security
controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. Security of our products, services, devices, and customers data
Security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our
own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts
on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. The security of our products and services is important in our customers purchasing decisions. To defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products
and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not
deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our
products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing
computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security
patches. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to
liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.    As we continue to grow the number and
scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment
increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data
security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under
laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.
Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to
compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of
our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to
customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses. We may have outages, data losses, and
disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.    Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.
We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we
introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Account services, Office 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, and Windows Stores.
We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we
maintain an

Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary
or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions,
damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.    As a leading global software and device maker, we are
closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European
Union (EU), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue
to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (the Commission) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume
Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive
significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with
specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commissions concerns relating to
competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other
products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that
better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products. Our portfolio of first-party devices
continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with
competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our
intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the
revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: 

 

 
 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products
to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 

 

 
 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our
associated intellectual property. 

 

 
 The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings. 

 

 
 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we
fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. 

 

 
 Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and
regulations.    The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (Anti-Corruption Laws) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive
inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the
U.S. in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies,

training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could
result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our
ability to do business in some geographies. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to
legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria. Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the
position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. Data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations.
Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments approach to their enforcement, and our
products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the
imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of
personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.    The growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the
movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, the EU and the U.S. formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that
provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This new framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in a predecessor mechanism. The
Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are likely to be reviewed by the European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic. Ongoing legal reviews may result in burdensome or inconsistent
requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs,
lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.    Our business is based on successfully
attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are
less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success.
Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in
increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may
result in adverse outcomes.    We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10,
significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to
conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the
period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax
liabilities.    We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various
jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation
could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is
made.

Item 1A

We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation
of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S.
multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    Our vertically-integrated hardware
products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue,
and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our
competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity
constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue.
Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same
risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. Our software products also may
experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could
cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our
exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. We strive to empower all people and
organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do
not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.    Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales.
The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of
social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other
countries. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.    A disruption or
failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our
corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of
California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our
customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating
results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected
countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of
which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply,

demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in
weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.    Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT
spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our
U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal
government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue. Our product
distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a
major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability
of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual
events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit
rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring
impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 63 million shares of our common stock
for $3.6 billion under a $40.0 billion share repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or
discontinued at any time without notice. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, $3.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion share repurchase program. All
repurchases were made using cash resources. On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program
authorizing an additional $40.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program will commence following completion of the program approved on September 16, 2013, has no expiration, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without
notice. Our stock repurchases may occur through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Excluded from this disclosure are shares repurchased to settle statutory employee tax withholding related to the vesting of stock awards.

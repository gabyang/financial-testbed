NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles We prepared our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the
interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation 2014
Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31, 2014. We have recast certain prior period
amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the
equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of,
and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and
stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for
our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and
outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions. Recent Accounting Guidance Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the
consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:

In addition to the investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that were purchased in connection
with our agreement to lend $2.0 billion to the group that completed their acquisition of Dell on October 29, 2013. These corporate notes are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are included in equity and other investments on the
balance sheet. The corporate notes are due October 31, 2023, and are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As of December 31, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes were
$351 million, $351 million, and $429 million, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $78 million. As of June 30, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was
$1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million.

As of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred
stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $550 million and $520 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is
not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. Unrealized Losses on Investments Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized
losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented
below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese
yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. As of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $7.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are
designated as fair-value hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts
receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of December 31, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.5 billion and $9.2 billion,
respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market
price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time,
to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of December 31, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for
managing market price risk were $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $483 million and $550 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts
purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. Interest Rate Securities held in our
fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using
exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and
sold were $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.7 billion and $936 million, respectively. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the total notional
derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $953 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.

Item 1

Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to
broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of December 31, 2014, the total notional
amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $828 million and $492 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $550 million and $440 million, respectively.
Commodity We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We
use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of December 31, 2014, the total notional amounts
of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $338 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million, respectively. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured
debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of December 31, 2014, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value
of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as
fair-value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in
the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments
designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure
is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge
components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains
(losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the
amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) into other income (expense).

The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging
instruments (designated hedge derivatives) and not designated as hedging instruments (non-designated hedge derivatives). The fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:

NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are: 

 

 
 Level 1inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments
primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. 

 

 
 Level 2inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, and
foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 

 

 
 Level 3inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and
preferred stock and goodwill when it is recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.

 These amounts represent the impact of netting derivative assets and derivative liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and
fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk. The changes in our Level 3
financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.

NOTE 8  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Nokias Devices and Services Business On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporations (Nokia) Devices and Services business (NDS) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash
acquired of $1.5 billion (the Acquisition). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokias repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction. The Acquisition is expected to
accelerate the growth of our Devices and Consumer (D&C) business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing. The purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information
about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed become available. The allocation of purchase price to goodwill was revised as of December 31, 2014. Goodwill was reduced by $29 million, due to revisions that decreased the
acquisition date fair value of other current assets by $14 million, other long-term assets by $7 million, long-term liabilities by $27 million, and the purchase price by $23 million. The adjustments did not have a material effect on our current or
prior period consolidated financial statements.

(a)
 Gross accounts receivable is $901 million, of which $147 million is expected to be uncollectible. 

(b)
 Goodwill was assigned to our Phone Hardware segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved
from the integration of NDS. Mojang Synergies AB On November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB (Mojang), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of
Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems and devices outside our own. Our purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and
additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available, including additional information relating to tax matters and finalization of our valuation of identified intangible assets. The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and
identifiable intangible assets of $916 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our D&C Other segment. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.4 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of
operations since the acquisition date. Other During the six months ended December 31, 2014, we completed seven additional acquisitions for total cash consideration of $422 million. These entities have been included in our consolidated results of
operations since their respective acquisition dates. Pro forma results of operations for Mojang and our other acquisitions during the
current period have not been presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on
the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in

NOTE 11  DEBT
As of December 31, 2014, we had $28.3 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $8.3 billion of short-term debt
and $20.0 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion. As of June 30, 2014, we had $22.6 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $2.0 billion of short-term debt and $20.6 billion of long-term debt. Short-term Debt As of December 31,
2014, we had $8.3 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 16 to 89 days. As of June 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding,
with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. In addition to the $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on November 14, 2018, we entered into another $5.0 billion credit facility in November 2014 that expires on November 4, 2015. These credit
facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented. Long-term Debt As of December 31,
2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $20.0 billion and $21.6 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt of
$20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

 In April 2013, we issued 550 million of debt securities. The notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these
notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. As of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current
portion, was $95 million and $100 million, respectively.

NOTE 12  INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 25% and 17%, respectively, and 24% and 17%
for the six months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and
distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Tax
contingencies and other tax liabilities were $11.3 billion and $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period
quarterly growth relating to intercompany transfer pricing adjustments. While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under
audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of December 31, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a
significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements if it is not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not
expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We
also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2014.

Item 1

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain
jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2014, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. Resolution of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 13  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
In July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align NDS with our companys overall
strategy (the Restructuring Plan). Pursuant to the Restructuring Plan, we will eliminate up to 18,000 positions in the current fiscal year, including approximately 12,500 professional and factory positions related to the NDS business.
The actions associated with the Restructuring Plan are expected to be completed by June 30, 2015. We incurred restructuring
charges of $132 million and $1.2 billion during the three and six months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation. As of
December 31, 2014, we have notified approximately 17,500 employees of their job elimination, entered into mutually agreed separations, or commenced required consultation processes, and recognized substantially all anticipated severance charges
for the 18,000 positions in the Restructuring Plan. We also wrote down the carrying value of certain assets and recognized a restructuring charge relating to the write downs of $56 million and $309 million during the three and six months ended
December 31, 2014, respectively. Restructuring charges were included in integration and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group
in Note 18  Segment Information. During the remainder of fiscal year 2015, we expect to incur additional pre-tax restructuring
charges of approximately $200 million, primarily related to asset write-downs and lease termination costs. Changes in the restructuring liability were

NOTE 15  CONTINGENCIES
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC
operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims
made in the United States. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we
may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the
number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. We estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $300 million, all of which had been accrued as of December 31, 2014. Three similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been settled. In March 2010, the court in the British
Columbia case certified it as a class action. After the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the case, in October 2013 the Canadian Supreme Court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the British Columbia case, which is now
scheduled for trial in September 2015. The other two cases were inactive pending action by the Supreme Court on the British Columbia case. Other
Antitrust Litigation and Claims GO Computer litigation In June 2005, GO Computer Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a complaint in California state court asserting antitrust claims under the Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the
early 1990s and its successor in interest, Lucent Corporation in the early 2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. After a mini-trial on standing issues, the case is now moving
forward with discovery, and a trial is set for September 2015. China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation 
On July 28, 2014, Microsoft was informed that Chinas State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC)
had begun a formal investigation relating to Chinas Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to
compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification issues related to Windows and Office software. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
Motorola litigation In
October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola Mobility (Motorola) with the International Trade Commission (ITC) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents
by Motorolas Android devices. Since then, Microsoft and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the ITC, in federal district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany and the United
Kingdom. The nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below. International Trade Commission In May 2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent, which became effective in July 2012 and was
affirmed on appeal in December 2013. In July 2013, Microsoft filed an action in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the ITCs May 2012 import ban against infringing Motorola products by the Bureau
of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), after learning that CBP had failed to fully enforce the order. In November 2010,
Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing Xbox products. At
Motorolas request, the ITC terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In March 2013, the ITC affirmed there was no violation of the remaining Motorola patent. Motorola appealed the ITCs decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit.

Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

U.S. District Court The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsofts ITC case against Motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the ITC case. In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its commitments
to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video standard
and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case described above and in suits described below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In February
2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling that (1) Motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms and conditions; and
(2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District Court set per unit royalties for Motorolas H.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft liability. In September
2013, following trial of Microsofts breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to Microsoft. Motorola appealed. Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one case in Wisconsin initially stayed and later dismissed without prejudice (a companion case to Motorolas ITC action),
have been transferred to the U.S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these cases in Seattle on agreement of the parties. 

 

 
 In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by a range of Microsoft products including mobile and PC operating system, productivity,
server, communication, browser and gaming products. 

 

 
 In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection with Microsofts assertion of
patents against Motorola that Microsoft agreed to license to certain qualifying entities on RAND terms and conditions. 

 

 
 In counterclaims, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola digital video recorders.
Germany In
July 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries. 

 

 
 Motorola asserts two patents (both now expired) are essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products
including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. In May 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable Microsoft products in Germany, which Microsoft appealed. Orders in the litigation
pending in Seattle, Washington described above enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction. 

 

 
 Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile,
Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. In April 2013, the court stayed the case pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is seeking to invalidate the patent. In November 2013, the Federal Patent Court invalidated
the originally issued patent claims, but ruled that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and Microsoft appealed. In June 2014, the court reopened infringement proceedings, which are currently stayed.


 

 
 Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any injunction by altering its products to avoid Motorolas infringement claims.


 

 
 Any damages would be determined in separate proceedings. In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued
injunctions on three of the Microsoft patents, which Motorola appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola








25


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending (in one of these two cases the asserted patent has expired). An additional infringement proceeding is still pending in the court of
first instance. In actions filed separately by Motorola to invalidate these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the cases in which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if
Motorola were to prevail following all appeals, Motorola could have a claim against Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction. IPCom patent litigation IPCom
GmbH & Co. (IPCom) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these
patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties
to pursue settlement discussions. Interdigital patent litigation InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, IDT) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless
communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware
seeking an injunction and damages. European copyright levies We have assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokias alleged failure to pay private copying levies in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that
incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (EU) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies
based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon
sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high
volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. We are litigating against certain collecting societies on the basis that the levy schemes exceed what the EU Directive and European Court of Justice decisions permit. Other patent and intellectual property claims In addition to these cases, there are approximately 100 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft. Product-Related Litigation U.S. cell phone litigation
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for
the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS acquisition and
have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (FCC Guidelines) are pre-empted by federal law.
The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around
emission guidelines. In September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs expert evidence of
general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. The motion was heard in December 2013 and January 2014. In March 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs general causation testimony on the

26


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

ground that it is pre-empted by federal law because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets, including those that comply with the FCC Guidelines. In August 2014, the court
granted in part defendants motion to exclude plaintiffs general causation experts. The court granted an order permitting an interlocutory appeal of its decision in October 2014. In December 2014, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
agreed to hear en banc defendants interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. The appeal is scheduled for argument in May 2015. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the
appeal. Canadian cell phone class action Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used
cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants
remain to be served. Other We
also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. As of December 31, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $691 million in other current liabilities and $35 million in other long-term
liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are
reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

NOTE 18  SEGMENT INFORMATION
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the companys Chief Executive
Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information in this note is reported on that basis. During the periods presented,
we reported our financial performance based on the following segments; D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other. On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 8  Business Combinations for additional details. NDS has been included
in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic
initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.

Revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on
the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware
segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology. We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of
expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether
on-premises or in the cloud. Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows: 

 

 
 Sales and marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment.

 Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where
the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation Redmond, Washington We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. We
conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such consolidated interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash
flows, and stockholders equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 31, 2014 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: Managements Discussion and Analysis, and Risk Factors. These
forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future,
opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in
Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q), Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q), and Managements Discussion and Analysis (Part I,
Item 2 of this Form 10-Q). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following
Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in
conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Microsoft is a technology leader focused on being the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. We strive to
reinvent productivity to empower people and organizations to do more and achieve more. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices. We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including
cloud-based services, to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are
related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both
technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible
through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. Key Opportunities and Investments We see significant opportunities for growth by investing
research and development resources in the following areas: 

 

 
 Digital work and life experiences. 

 

 
 Our cloud operating system. 

 

 
 Our devices operating system and hardware. With investments in these areas, we work to fulfill the evolving needs of our customers in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. We view mobility broadly  not just by devices, but by experiences. Today,
people move just as quickly into new contexts as to new locations. Mobility goes beyond devices users carry with them as they move from place to place, to encompass the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany them as they
move from setting to setting in their lives. Many of our customers are dual users, employing technology for work or school and also in their personal lives.

Item 2

Digital work and life experiences We believe we can significantly enhance the digital lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication, productivity, and information services. We work to deliver digital work and life experiences
that are reinvented for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. Productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We will design applications as
dual-use with the intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each persons privacy choices. The foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, and business process tools
including Skype, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Bing, and Dynamics. We see opportunity in combining these
services in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices, remain at the center of the digital experience. We will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. As people move
from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We strive to engineer applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways. Cloud operating system Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges.
Enterprises are asked to deploy technology that advances business strategy. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock
business insights from a world of data. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity, and to manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices. To achieve these objectives,
increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly
lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers
application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. The cloud creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. With Azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe
the combination of Azure and Windows Server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. We are working to enhance the return on information technology (IT) investment by
enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partners datacenter, or in our datacenters with common
security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our cloud enables richer
employee experiences. We enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. We will continue to innovate with higher
level services including identity and directory services, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer
ecosystem, our digital work and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. Our strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other
infrastructure to support our devices and services. Devices operating system and hardware With our Windows devices operating system and hardware, we strive to set the standard for productivity experiences. We aim to deliver the richest
and most consistent user experience for digital work and life scenarios on screens of all sizes  from phones, tablets, and laptops to TVs and large, multi-touch displays. We are investing to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and
capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. We are working

to create a broad developer opportunity by enabling universal Windows applications to run across all device targets. We are developing new input/output methods like speech, pen, and gesture to
power more personal computing experiences. We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. We
also build hardware to set the standard for productivity experiences and stimulate more demand for the entire Windows ecosystem, as we do with Surface, and following the acquisition of substantially all of Nokia Corporations
(Nokia) Devices and Services business (NDS) on April 25, 2014, phones. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to
unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers. We anticipate many new mobile device categories and we anticipate experiences to emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen
sizes. We will invest to be on the forefront of this innovation, focusing on dual users and their needs across work and life. Our future opportunity
There are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over
the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: 

 

 
 Delivering new high-value digital work and digital life experiences to improve how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another.


 

 
 Establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, other devices, and the cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the
cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market. 

 

 
 Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. 

 

 
 Developing new devices that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including speech, pen, and gesture. 

 

 
 Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command. We believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing
investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and
devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the users choice of
which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. To support our strategy of reinventing productivity to empower every person and every organization to do
more and achieve more, we announced a restructuring plan in July 2014 (Restructuring Plan). Through this Restructuring Plan, we strive to increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify
our organization. Even if we achieve these goals, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. With the acquisition of NDS, we expect our effective tax rate to
increase as our business mix changes. We prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments
require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent
worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses, and
competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk
Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q).

Item 2

Seasonality Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season
spending by consumers. Our Computing and Gaming Hardware segment is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Computing and Gaming Hardware
segment has generated approximately 50% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter. Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on certain bundled
products and services (Bundled Offerings) and revenue deferred on pre-sales of Windows 8.1 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers before general availability (Windows 8.1 Pre-Sales). If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services,

Three months ended December 31, 2014 compared with three months ended December 31, 2013
Revenue increased $2.0 billion or 8%, reflecting the acquisition of NDS and growth from our Commercial Cloud, offset in part by a decline in Xbox
Platform, Windows Phone, Office Commercial, and Windows OEM revenue. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 1%, and we continued to experience revenue declines in certain countries, primarily Japan. Gross margin increased $137 million or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $1.8 billion or 22% increase in cost of revenue.
Cost of revenue increased, mainly due to the acquisition of NDS and Commercial Cloud, offset in part by a decline in Xbox Platform. Operating income decreased $193 million or 2%, reflecting integration and restructuring expenses associated with our Restructuring Plan, as well as
increased research and development expenses, offset in part by higher gross margin and a decline in general and administrative expenses. Integration and restructuring expenses were $243 million, or $0.02 in diluted earnings per share. Key changes in
operating expenses were: 

 

 
 Research and development expenses increased $155 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services in the Devices engineering
group, including NDS expenses, and Cloud and Enterprise engineering group, reflecting ongoing commitment to our mobile-first and cloud-first strategy. 

 

 
 General and administrative expenses decreased $100 million or 8%, mainly due to lower headcount-related expenses and legal charges, offset in part by NDS
expenses. Revenue increased $6.6 billion or 15%, reflecting the acquisition of NDS and growth across several of our consumer and commercial businesses,
evidenced by higher revenue from our Commercial Cloud, Surface, and server products. These increases were offset in part by a decline in revenue from Office Commercial, Windows Phone, and Windows OEM. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency
impact of approximately 1%, and we continued to experience revenue declines in certain countries, primarily Japan.

2014 compared with three months ended December 31, 2013 D&C Licensing revenue decreased $1.4 billion or 25%, mainly due to
a decline in Windows Phone revenue, as well as lower revenue from licenses of Windows OEM and Office Consumer. Windows Phone revenue decreased $635 million or 61%, primarily due to prior year revenue associated with joint strategic initiatives with
Nokia that ended in conjunction with the acquisition of NDS. Windows OEM revenue declined $455 million or 13%, due to a 13% decrease in both OEM Pro revenue and OEM non-Pro revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue decreased, primarily due to benefits
realized from the expiration of support for Windows XP in the prior year and an increased mix of lower-priced licenses for devices sold to academic customers. Windows OEM non-Pro revenue declined, mainly due to an increased mix of opening price
point devices sold. Office Consumer revenue declined $208 million or 25%, reflecting the shift of customers to Office 365 Consumer, and declines in the Japan PC market where Office has high attach to PCs. D&C Licensing gross margin decreased $1.1 billion or 22%, primarily due to the decline in revenue, offset in part by a $272 million or 48%
decrease in cost of revenue.

with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia. Computing and Gaming Hardware Computing and Gaming Hardware revenue decreased $473 million or 11%, primarily due to lower revenue from Xbox Platform, offset in part by higher Surface revenue. Xbox Platform revenue decreased $703 million or 20%,
driven by a 10% decline in total console volume, the transition from Xbox 360 to Xbox One with lower prices compared to the prior year, and lower revenue from second- and third-party video games and accessories. We sold 6.6 million Xbox
consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 compared with 7.4 million consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Surface revenue increased $211 million or 24%, primarily due to Surface Pro 3 units sold, offset in part by

 Not Meaningful Corporate and Other revenue comprises certain revenue deferrals, including those related to product and service upgrade offers and pre-sales of new
products to OEMs prior to general availability. Corporate and Other revenue increased $369 million, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals compared to the prior year.
During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $326 million of previously deferred net revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, we deferred $135 million of net revenue, related
to Bundled Offerings, offset in part by the recognition of $105 million of previously deferred revenue related to Windows 8.1 Pre-Sales. Corporate and Other gross margin increased $368 million, due to increased revenue. Corporate and Other revenue increased $457 million, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. During the six
months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $297 million of previously deferred net revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During the six months ended December 31, 2013, we deferred $140 million of net revenue, related to Bundled
Offerings.

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the
amortization of purchased software code. Research and development expenses increased $155 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services in
the Devices engineering group, primarily $280 million of NDS expenses, and Cloud and Enterprise engineering group, reflecting ongoing commitment to our mobile-first and cloud-first strategy. These increases were offset in part by a decline in
research and development expenses in our Operating Systems engineering group, primarily driven by reduced headcount-related expenses. Six months
ended December 31, 2014 compared with six months ended December 31, 2013 Research and development expenses increased $453

General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance
expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative expenses decreased $100 million or 8%, mainly due to lower headcount-related expenses and legal charges, offset in part
by NDS expenses. NDS general and administrative expenses were $83 million during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Six months ended

our acquisition of NDS. Integration and restructuring expenses were $243 million during the three months ended December 31, 2014, comprised mainly of restructuring
charges of $132 million, including the write-down of certain assets and employee severance expenses in connection with our Restructuring Plan, and integration expenses of $111 million, primarily systems consolidation costs and employee-related
expenses. See Note 13  Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Financial Statements for discussion of our Restructuring Plan. Six months ended

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and
credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of
other comprehensive income until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into other income (expense). Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields offset in part by higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher
outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity derivatives, offset in part by lower losses on
equity and foreign exchange contracts. Other during the current period reflects recognized losses from divestitures. Six months ended
December 31, 2014 compared with six months ended December 31, 2013 Dividends and interest income increased due to higher
portfolio balances, offset in part by lower yields. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity and fixed income securities and
lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $35 million in the current period, compared with $66 million in comparable period. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity derivatives in the
current period compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on foreign exchange and equity contracts. Other during the current period reflects recognized losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures.

INCOME TAXES
Our effective
tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 25% and 17%, respectively, and 24% and 17% for the six months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
This quarters effective tax rate was higher than the prior years second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to an
Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) audit adjustment, changes in the geographic mix of our business, non-deductible operating losses, and U.S. tax relief related to a Denmark tax assessment recorded in the prior years second quarter.
The current year-to-date effective tax rate was higher than the prior year-to-date effective tax rate, primarily due to an I.R.S. audit adjustment, changes in the geographic mix of our business, non-deductible operating losses, restructuring
charges, and U.S. tax relief related to a Denmark tax assessment recorded in the prior year.

Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $11.3 billion and $10.4 billion as of
December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period quarterly growth relating to intercompany transfer pricing adjustments. While we settled
a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the
examination. As of December 31, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements if it is not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not
anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2014. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2014, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. Resolution of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash
Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $90.2 billion as of December 31, 2014,
compared with $85.7 billion as of June 30, 2014. Equity and other investments were $12.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity
and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also
include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve
economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at December 31, 2014, $82.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries
and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local
regulatory) was $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 80% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested
in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment
returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the
creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $430 million as of December 31, 2014. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances
for the three months ended December 31, 2014 were $251 million and $523 million, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the six months ended December 31, 2014 were $325 million and $603 million,
respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair
value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly

PART I
Item 2

or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an
immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2
investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the
investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker
prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these
investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations increased $76 million to $12.7 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2014, mainly due to increases in cash received from customers, offset in part by payments related to
restructuring charges and other working capital changes. Cash used in financing increased $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion, mainly due to a $965 million decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $732 million increase in cash
used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $6.8 billion to $12.5 billion, mainly due to a $4.0 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities and a $2.8 billion increase in cash used for
acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate
environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of
existing debt. As of December 31, 2014, we had $28.3 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $8.3 billion of short-term
debt and $20.0 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion. Short-term debt As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.3 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and
maturities ranging from 16 to 89 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. In addition
to the $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on November 14, 2018, we entered into another $5.0 billion credit facility in November 2014 that expires on November 4, 2015. These credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial
paper program. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented. Long-term debt As of December 31, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair
value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $20.0 billion and $21.6 billion, respectively. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

 In December 2013, we issued 3.5 billion of debt securities. 

(b)
 In April 2013, we issued 550 million of debt securities. The notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these
notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $95 million.
Unearned Revenue Unearned
revenue at December 31, 2014 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at
inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2014 also included payments for:
post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox Live subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Office 365 subscriptions; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled
Offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue
making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative
staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any
related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.

Liquidity We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and
Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly
dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows
from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant
discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in
higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recent
Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and
International Financial Reporting Standards, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and
we are currently evaluating its impact.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical
accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment
to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual
license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage
period. Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may
require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the
implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services,
and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is
recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence, and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the
deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the
selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
related to each deliverable. Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that
considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans
to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including
industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost
basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate
our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on
an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a
significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units,
and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of
future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market
conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of NDS, is reflective of the enterprise value
based on the long-term financial forecast for the business. In this highly competitive and volatile market, it is possible that we may not realize our forecasts. Given the value assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation, we will
closely monitor the performance of the business versus the long-term forecast to determine if any impairments arise in our Phone Hardware reporting unit. Except as clarified above, we determined that none of our reporting units were at risk of
impairment as of our most recent annual goodwill impairment testing date.

Item 2, 3

Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is
established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological
feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs
is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency
such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be
accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial
statements. Income Taxes The
objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys
financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of
the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also
provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our
consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels,
pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated
volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.
ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion
of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and
use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit
risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.

Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their
economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy,
and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
VALUE-AT-RISK
We use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our
market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including
determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the
historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are
not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. The following table sets forth the one-day VaR
for substantially all of our positions as of December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014 and for the three months ended December 31, 2014:

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
See Note 15  Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal
proceedings in which we are involved.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across
all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small,
specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with
changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to
businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A
well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain
attractive margins. The strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8 operating system, Surface, Windows Phone, Xbox One, and associated cloud-based services. We face significant
competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. 

 

 
 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded
with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and digital music players. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer
some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors in smartphones and tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model will
increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.

Item 1A


 
 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms
developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to
perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to
our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their
commitment to our platform. 

 

 
 The success of the Windows phone platform is an important element of our goal to enhance personal productivity in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. The
marketplace among mobile phone platforms is highly competitive. We may face issues in selecting, engaging, or securing support from operators and retailers for Windows phones due to, for instance, inadequate sales training or incentives, or
insufficient marketing support for the Windows Phone platform. 

 

 
 Competing platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as stores) with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and
utility of applications available on a platform is important to device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs to move data and buy new applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write
applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.
Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. 

 

 
 Even as we transition to a mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear
the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to
businesses and consumers under this model. 

 

 
 Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue
funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. 

 

 
 Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and
earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality
of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions,
and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.

Item 1A

Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive
risks.    A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. In July 2014, our leadership announced its strategic vision to compete and grow as a productivity and
platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form
factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows
ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to
build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:


 

 
 continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share; 

 

 
 maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,
tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices; 

 

 
 continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers; 

 

 
 ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data; and


 

 
 making our suite of cloud-based services platform agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are
not effective in executing organizational changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development
investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. We make significant investments in new
products and services that may not be profitable.    We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating
system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the
development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors,
including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and
hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and
even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect
our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our
business.    We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges
and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from
our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will
depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased
revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.

In April 2014, we acquired from Nokia substantially all of its NDS business to accelerate our
growth in phones and support the entire Windows ecosystem. We may not realize all of the anticipated financial and other benefits from this transaction, including operating efficiencies and cost savings. We may not be successful in developing a
vibrant and competitive ecosystem for Windows-based phones that combines differentiated hardware, software, services, and third-party applications. We may not achieve mobile phone market share targets. We may see lower than expected growth rates for
the phone markets. The mix of premium and lower-cost devices we sell may put downward pressure on prices or margins. We may not be effective in executing the restructuring we announced in July 2014 or otherwise integrating the NDS business with
Microsofts ongoing operations, including matching manufacturing capacity to demand. Existing Microsoft smart device original equipment manufacturers may respond negatively to the changes in our business or the new competitive environment.
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to
earnings.    We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the
carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we
participate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of
operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous Online Services Division business (Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure).
The valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of NDS, is reflective of the
enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business. In this highly competitive and volatile market, we may not realize our forecasts. As a result, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our
consolidated financial statements due to an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets. We may not earn the revenues we expect from
our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is
difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow
slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine
products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software
intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating
that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for
licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail
to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price
changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Third parties may claim we infringe
their intellectual property rights.    From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we
compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing
agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop

selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money
damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be
issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as
part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if
there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our
application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret
protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase
the security risks described in the next paragraph. Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs,
liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. Security of Microsofts information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. They may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, or act
in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have
cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business
applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in
theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and
customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. Security of our products, services, devices, and customers data Security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our
cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including
many of ours, and we expect that to continue. The security of our products and services is important in our customers purchasing decisions. To defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve
the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that
protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers
to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional

products or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. Any of these
actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no
assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.    As we continue to grow the number and
scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment
increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data
security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under
laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.
Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to
compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based
solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer
expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses. We may have outages, data losses, and
disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.    Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.
We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we
introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Azure, Outlook.com, Microsoft Office Web Apps, Windows Stores, and
Microsoft Account services. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and
complex. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other
third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our
products.    As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law
activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have
previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (the Commission)
closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. In 2004, the
Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications
protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commissions concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission
concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and
increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of
our products.

Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a
large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase.
Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently
implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as
these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such
actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: 

 

 
 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products
to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 

 

 
 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our
associated intellectual property. 

 

 
 The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings. 

 

 
 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we
fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. Our international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.    The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
anti-corruption laws and regulations (Anti-Corruption Laws) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere about our business activities
outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments,
our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct
of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal
liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria. Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the
position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world may lead to increased
regulation requiring local hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue.
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.    Our business is based on successfully
attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are
less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, including key employees of the NDS business acquired in April 2014, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected.
Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    We are subject to a variety of claims and
lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or

injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these
matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities.    We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under
audit by tax authorities. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final
determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the
U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly
impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.
Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    Our vertically-integrated
hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, Lumia phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses,
lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for
hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement
supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and Lumia phones are assembled in Asia
and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products
we may offer. Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we
develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays
in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.
Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.    Our customers are located in over 200
countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing
nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our
international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that
we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries. Catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may
disrupt our business.    A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales,
providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we
have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our
ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the
potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.

Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic
disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware
manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available
sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling
computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our
business.    Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other
computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from
failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services
and adversely affect our revenue.

Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building
devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result,
allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various
holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment
portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment
portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1    ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related interim statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and
stockholders equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation 2012 Form 10-K filed on
July 26, 2012 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Principles of Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. Equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through
which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our
reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements
comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions. Recasting of Certain Prior Period Information We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, including the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income from retained earnings to a separate component of
stockholders equity, the reclassification of cost of revenue from operating expenses to a separate line and the addition of a gross profit line in the income statements, and the recasting of segment information for immaterial movements of
business activities between segments and changes in cost allocations, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. Recently Adopted
Accounting Guidance In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on testing
goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity
determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting
unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new
guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of
comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous
statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in
both the statement in

Item 1

which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This guidance was amended in December 2011 when the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely
defers presentation of reclassification adjustments. We adopted this new amended guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new amended guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related
arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and
the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
NOTE 2    EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:

Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods
presented. In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock if
certain conditions are met. As of December 31, 2012, none of these securities had met price or other conditions that would make them eligible for conversion and therefore were excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted EPS. See
Note 11  Debt for additional information.

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized
losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of
December 31, 2012.

At December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the recorded bases of common and preferred
stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $360 million and $313 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of
other-than-temporary impairment. It is not possible for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. Debt Investment Maturities

NOTE 5    DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance
investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs
include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. currency equivalents. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to
foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for
up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. As of December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $4.8 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. Foreign currency risks
related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of
these foreign exchange contracts sold were $590 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. Certain options and forwards not designated as
hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of December 31, 2012, the total notional amounts of
these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.6 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.6 billion and $7.3 billion,
respectively. Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to
broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity
derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of December 31, 2012, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $954 million and $641 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $982 million, respectively.

PART I
Item 1

Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that
correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2012, the total
notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and
$1.9 billion, respectively. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to
gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of December 31, 2012 and
June 30, 2012, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual
credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of December 31, 2012, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $355 million and $465 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of credit
contracts purchased and sold were $318 million and $456 million, respectively. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swap, futures and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities,
including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of December 31, 2012, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $396 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the
total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.5 billion and $445 million, respectively. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent
Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to
the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of December 31, 2012, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and
the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair-value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in
the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses)
on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges,
changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge
ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.

Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair
values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the
underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from OCI into other income (expense). The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (designated hedge
derivatives) and not designated as hedging instruments (non-designated hedge derivatives). The fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists
and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:

We estimate that $63 million of net derivative gains included in OCI at December 31, 2012 will be reclassified
into earnings within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during the three and six months ended December 31, 2012.
Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses) Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of
gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity
contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.

NOTE 6    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are: 

 

 
 Level 1inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments
primarily include U.S. treasuries, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. 

 

 
 Level 2inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where



16


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates,
and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, mortgage-backed securities, agency securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Our
Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 

 

 
 Level 3inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in certain
corporate bonds and goodwill when it is recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. We value the Level 3 corporate bonds using internally developed valuation models, inputs to which include interest rate curves, credit spreads, stock
prices, and volatilities. Our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise derivatives for foreign equities. In certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and we use management judgment to develop assumptions to
determine fair value for these derivatives. Unobservable inputs used in all of these models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments
are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current
financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The measurement periods for purchase price allocations end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances
becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as other in the above table. Also
included within other are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

 In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt outstanding. 

*
 Not applicable. Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our
long-term debt, including the current portion, was $62 million and $56 million, respectively. Notes The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. Convertible Debt In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal
amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt
agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $9 million. Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsofts common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On
or after March 15, 2013, the

notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of
cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are
required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were
allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt. In connection with issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of
the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call
options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically
to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders equity.
NOTE 12    INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates were approximately 18% and 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively,
and 18% and 20% for the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates. Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a
portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the
examination. As of December 31, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to
examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Certain
jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2011, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.

NOTE 14    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES
Yahoo! Commercial Agreement On December 4, 2009, we entered into a 10-year agreement with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo!) whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites. Microsoft
provided Yahoo! with revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after implementation of the Microsoft search ads platform in each country, extended by an additional 12 months for the U.S. and Canada. These guarantees are calculated,
paid, and adjusted periodically and are rate guarantees, not guarantees of search volume. We expect the remaining cost of the revenue per search guarantees will be less than $100 million.
NOTE 15    CONTINGENCIES
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC
operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the United States. All settlements in the United States have received final court approval. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of
platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on
the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The actual costs of these
settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9
billion and $2.0 billion. At December 31, 2012, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $500 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.4 billion
mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses. The three cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada
have not been settled. In March 2010, the court in the British Columbia case certified it as a class action. In April 2011, the British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding that
indirect purchasers do not have a claim. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, which was heard in the fall of 2012. The other two actions have been stayed.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims In November 2004, Novell, Inc. (Novell) filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (later transferred to federal
court in Maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novells ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. In June 2005, the trial court
granted our motion to dismiss four of Novells six claims. In March 2010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft as to all remaining claims. The court of appeals reversed that ruling as to one claim. Trial of that
claim took place from October to December 2011 and resulted in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. In July 2012, the trial court granted Microsofts motion for judgment as a matter of law. Novell has appealed this
decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Government Competition Law Matters In December 2009, the European Commission adopted a decision that rendered legally binding commitments offered by Microsoft to address the
Commissions concerns about the inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows. Among other things, Microsoft committed to display a Browser Choice Screen on Windows-based PCs in Europe where Internet Explorer is set as the
default browser. Due to a technical error, we failed to deliver the requisite software to enable that display to PCs that came preinstalled with a version of Windows 7 called Windows 7 Service Pack 1. We did deliver the requisite software to PCs
running the original version of Windows 7 and earlier editions of Windows. Following notification by the Commission of reports that some PCs were not receiving the update, we promptly fixed the error and advised the Commission of what we had
discovered. PCs that come preinstalled with Windows 7 Service Pack 1 are now receiving the Browser Choice Screen software, as intended. In July 2012, the Commission announced that it had opened proceedings to investigate whether Microsoft had
failed to comply with this commitment. The Commission stated that if a company is found to have breached a legally binding commitment, the company may be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual revenue. In October 2012, the Commission issued a
Statement of Objections, preliminarily concluding that Microsoft failed to comply with the 2009 commitments. We have provided our written response and waived our right to a hearing. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims Motorola Litigation In October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola Mobility (Motorola) with the International Trade
Commission (ITC) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorolas Android devices. Since then, Microsoft and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other in the ITC, in
federal district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany and the United Kingdom. In April 2012, following complaints by Microsoft and Apple, the European Unions competition office opened two antitrust
investigations against Motorola to determine whether it has abused certain of its standard essential patents to distort competition in breach of European Union antitrust rules. In June 2012, we received a request for information from the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) apparently related to an FTC investigation into whether Motorolas conduct violates U.S. law. The nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below. International Trade Commission The hearing
in Microsofts ITC case against Motorola took place in August 2011 on seven of the nine patents originally asserted in the complaint. In December 2011, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an initial determination that Motorola
infringed one Microsoft patent, and recommended that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order against Motorola prohibiting importation of infringing Motorola Android devices. In May 2012, the ITC issued the limited exclusion order recommended by the
ALJ, which became effective on July 18, 2012. Microsoft has appealed certain aspects of the ITC ruling adverse to Microsoft and Motorola has appealed the ITC exclusion order. In November 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft in the ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and
accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing Xbox products into the U.S. In April 2012, the ALJ found that Xbox products infringe four of the five patents asserted by Motorola. The ALJ recommended
that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order. Both Microsoft and Motorola sought ITC review of the ALJs findings. In June 2012, Microsoft filed a motion to terminate the investigation as to certain patents based on
facts arising as the result of Googles acquisition of Motorola. The

25


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1

ITC determined that it would review the ALJs initial determination in its entirety and remanded the matter to the ALJ (1) to apply certain ITC case precedent, (2) to rule on
Microsofts June 2012 motion to terminate, and (3) set a new target date for completion of the investigation. The ALJ held a hearing in December 2012 and has set a target date for a final ITC ruling in July 2013. At Motorolas
request, the ITC has terminated its investigation as to two patents, and in January 2013 Motorola requested that the investigation be terminated as to two additional Motorola patents. If granted, only one Motorola patent will be at issue
before the ITC. If the ITC issues an exclusion order or cease and desist order, it will be subject to Presidential review for up to 60 days, during which Microsoft may be able to import Xbox products subject to posting a bond. If an order is
issued and survives Presidential review, Microsoft may be able to mitigate the orders impact by altering Xbox products to avoid Motorolas infringement claims. U.S. District Court The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a
companion to Microsofts ITC case against Motorola has been stayed pending the outcome of Microsofts ITC case. In November
2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory
(RAND) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In suits described below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued
Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In February 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling that (1) Motorola entered into binding contractual
commitments with standards organizations committing to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms and conditions; and (2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. The court rejected Motorolas argument that
Microsoft had repudiated its right to a RAND license, and ruled a trial is needed to determine whether Motorola is in breach of its obligation to enter into a patent license with Microsoft and, if so, the amount of the RAND royalty. In April 2012,
the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing Motorola from taking steps to enforce an injunction in Germany relating to the H.264 video patents. In May 2012, the court converted that order into a preliminary injunction. Motorola
appealed the courts injunction orders to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the orders in September 2012. The Seattle District Court held a trial in November 2012 to determine the RAND royalty for Motorolas
H.264 and 802.11 patents. In December 2012, the Seattle District Court ruled that Motorola could not obtain injunctive relief in connection with any of its claims for infringement of its H.264 and 802.11 patents. Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in Wisconsin (a companion case to
Motorolas ITC action), have been transferred to the U.S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. No trial dates have been set in any of the transferred cases, and the court has stayed
these cases on agreement of the parties. 

 

 
 In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by many Microsoft products including Windows Mobile 6.5 and Windows Phone 7, Windows
Marketplace, Silverlight, Windows Vista and Windows 7, Exchange Server 2003 and later, Exchange ActiveSync, Windows Live Messenger, Lync Server 2010, Outlook 2010, Office 365, SQL Server, Internet Explorer 9, Xbox, and Kinect.


 

 
 In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts that Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection with Microsofts assertion
of patents against Motorola that Microsoft has agreed to license to certain qualifying entities on RAND terms and conditions. 

 

 
 In counterclaims in the patent actions brought by Motorola, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola
digital video recorders. Germany In July 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries. 

 

 
 Two of the patents are asserted by Motorola to be essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products
including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. Motorola seeks damages and an injunction. In May 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable Microsoft products in Germany. However,
due to orders in the separate litigation pending in Seattle, Washington described above, Motorola is enjoined from taking steps to enforce the German injunction. Damages would be determined in later proceedings. Microsoft has appealed the rulings of
the first instance court.

Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1


 
 Motorola asserts one of the patents covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail
Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. Motorola seeks damages and an injunction. If the court rules in favor of Motorola, an injunction could be issued immediately relating to these products employing the ActiveSync protocol
in Germany, which Motorola could then take steps to enforce. We expect the court to issue a ruling in February 2013. If Motorola prevails, damages would be determined in later proceedings. 

 

 
 Should injunction orders be issued and enforced by Motorola, Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact by altering its products to avoid
Motorolas infringement claims. In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in September, October, and December 2011
and in April 2012, Microsoft asserts Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft patents. Microsoft seeks damages and an injunction. In May, July, and September 2012, courts in Germany issued injunctions on three patents against Motorola Android
devices and in May and July ruled against Microsoft on two patents. Microsoft is taking steps to enforce the injunctions. Damages will be determined in later proceedings. Each party has appealed or is expected to appeal the rulings against it.
United Kingdom In December
2011, Microsoft filed an action against Motorola in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, in London, England, seeking to revoke the UK part of the European patent asserted by Motorola in Germany against the ActiveSync
protocol. In February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. A trial took place in December 2012, and the court ruled that Motorolas patent is invalid and revoked. The court
also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in Googles ActiveSync license. Other Patent and
Intellectual Property Claims In addition to these cases, there are approximately 60 other patent infringement cases pending against
Microsoft. Other We also are
subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material
adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. As of December 31, 2012, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $531 million in other current liabilities and $194 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our contingent legal matters. While we
intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility
of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

NOTE 17    SEGMENT INFORMATION
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the companys Chief Executive
Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information within this note is reported on that basis. Our five segments are
Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we changed the name of our Windows & Windows Live
Division to Windows Division. Due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue earned and costs incurred by one segment
may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain contracts may be allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. Costs that are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to incent
cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity. Allocated costs may include those relating to development and marketing of products and services from which multiple
segments benefit, or those costs relating to services performed by one segment on behalf of other segments. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated
costs include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain other
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities;
research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance. We have recast certain prior period amounts
within this note to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, reflecting immaterial movements of business activities between segments and changes in cost allocations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation Redmond, Washington We have reviewed the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders
equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporations management. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of
interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such consolidated interim financial
statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have
previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2012, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 26, 2012 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2012 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

OVERVIEW
The following managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is
provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology
that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices. We generate revenue by developing,
licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling hardware that integrates with our cloud-based services, and by
delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic
and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At
Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. Key Opportunities and Investments We
invest research and development resources in new products and services in the areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth. As we look forward, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other
devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. With this trend, we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal
lives. Devices with End-User Services We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. In some cases, we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Surface. In all our work with partners and on our
own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique
communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers around the world.

Windows 8 reflects this shift. Launched in October 2012 on a variety of state-of-the-art
hardware, Windows 8 is built to take advantage of our consumer cloud services. Windows 8 is made for both personal and professional use and unites the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. For example, Xbox Music,
Video, Games, and SmartGlass applications make it possible to select and experience entertainment across a range of devices by simplifying and increasing the accessibility of those experiences. SkyDrive, our cloud storage solution, connects content
across all of a users devices. Bings search technologies in Windows 8 are designed to help users get more done. Skype has a new Windows 8 application and connects directly to the new Office. The new Office is designed for Windows 8 and takes advantage of new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. It unlocks new experiences
for reading, note taking, meetings, and communications and brings social experiences directly into productivity and collaboration scenarios. The combination of a Windows 8 tablet with OneNote and SkyDrive will transform how to take notes, annotate
documents, and share information. Services for the Enterprise Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprise IT departments are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more
productive, collaborative, and satisfied. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate
devices. To address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office,
Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to
realize the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. Cloud-based solutions
provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy
computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and
network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. Because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. For
businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. Unique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on-premise assets however best suits their own needs. For example, a company can
choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premises, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure, and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a
partners datacenter, or in Microsofts datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our business customers tell us these hybrid capabilities are
critical to harnessing the power of the cloud so they can reach new levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth. Our Future Opportunity
There are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these
areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. We are investing significant resources in: 

 

 
 Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gestures, and speech. 

 

 
 Making technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command, with machine learning. 

 

 
 Building and running cloud services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.


 
 Firmly establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device
user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market. 

 

 
 Delivering new scenarios with improvements in how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another. We believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing Windows ecosystem
position us to be a leader in these areas. Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for
growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. At Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and
are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent
worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation. Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under
Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q). Seasonality Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday
season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices
Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter. Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on: sales of Windows
7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the Windows Upgrade Offer) and pre-sales of Windows 8 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers before general availability (Windows 8
Pre-Sales) (collectively, the Windows Deferral); sales of the current version of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new Office at minimal or no cost (the Office Upgrade Offer) and
pre-sales of the new Office to OEMs and retailers before general availability (Office Pre-Sales) (collectively, the Office Deferral); and on sales of video games with the right to receive specified software
upgrades/enhancements (the Video Game Deferral).

Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended December 31, 2011
Revenue increased, primarily due to the launch of Windows 8 and Surface on October 26, 2012, and strong sales of Server and
Tools products and services, offset in part by lower Entertainment and Devices revenue. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a net $622 million of revenue related to the Windows Deferral, and we deferred a net $788
million of revenue related to the Office Deferral and $380 million of revenue related to the Video Game Deferral. Operating income
decreased, reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Key changes in operating expenses were: 

 

 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased $547 million or 15%, primarily reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface. 

 

 
 Research and development expenses increased $157 million or 7%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to the Entertainment and
Devices Division. Revenue decreased, primarily due to the deferral of certain Office, Windows, and video game revenue and lower Entertainment and Devices revenue,
offset in part by strong sales of Server and Tools products and services and the launch of Windows 8 and Surface. During the six months ended December 31, 2012, we deferred $977 million of revenue related to the Office Deferral, a net $545
million of revenue related to the Windows Deferral, and $380 million of revenue related to the Video Game Deferral. Operating income
decreased, reflecting lower revenue and increased cost of revenue and operating expenses. Key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were: 

 

 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased $592 million or 9%, primarily reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface. 

 

 
 Cost of revenue increased $445 million or 5%, reflecting payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, higher headcount-related expenses,
primarily related to Server and Tools, and increased product costs associated with Surface, offset in part by lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. 

 

 
 Research and development expenses increased $288 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to the Entertainment and
Devices Division.

Item 2

Excluding the impact of the Windows Deferral, approximately 65% of total Windows Division revenue
comes from Windows operating system software purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows, Surface, PC hardware products, and online
advertising. Windows Division revenue increased from the prior year, due in part to the recognition of a net $622 million of revenue related to Windows
Deferral, as well as due to sales of Surface and Windows 8 upgrades. OEM revenue grew 17%, reflecting the net Windows Deferral recognition and increased demand in our distribution channels, offset in part by a decline in the x86 PC market.
Windows Division operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher sales and marketing expenses and
cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $420 million or 49%, reflecting advertising costs associated with the launch of Windows 8 and Surface. Cost of revenue increased $293 million or 58%, including product costs associated with
Surface and Windows 8 and Windows 8 upgrade support costs. Six months ended December 31, 2012 compared with six months ended December 31,
2011 Windows Division revenue decreased from the prior year, due in part to the deferral of a net $545 million of revenue related
to the Windows Upgrade Offer, as well as due to a decline in the x86 PC market and continued higher relative growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets. The revenue decrease was offset in part by sales
of Surface and Windows 8 upgrades. Windows Division operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and higher sales and
marketing expenses and cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $368 million or 24%, reflecting advertising costs associated with the launch of Windows 8 and Surface. Cost of revenue increased $292 million or 30%, including product
costs associated with Surface and Windows 8 and Windows 8 upgrade support costs. Server and Tools

Online Services Division (OSD) develops and markets information and content designed to help people
simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and to help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, and advertiser tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display
advertising, accounting for nearly all of OSDs annual revenue. Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended
December 31, 2011 Online advertising revenue grew $109 million or 15% to $823 million, reflecting continued growth in search
advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue. Search revenue grew, primarily due to increased revenue per search. According to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share for the month of December 2012 was
approximately 16%, and grew 120 basis points year over year. Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 26% for the month of December 2012, down 90 basis points year over year. OSDs operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $72
million, driven by lower traffic acquisition costs and Yahoo! reimbursement costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $31 million or 16%, due mainly to decreased advertising and corporate marketing activities. Online advertising revenue grew $193 million or 15% to $1.5 billion, reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by
decreased display advertising revenue. Search revenue grew, primarily due to increased revenue per search. OSDs operating loss
was reduced by higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by higher research and development expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $163 million, driven by lower traffic acquisition costs and Yahoo!
reimbursement costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $71 million or 19%, due mainly to decreased advertising and corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses increased $47 million or 8%, primarily reflecting higher

Microsoft Business Division (MBD) develops and markets software and online services designed to
increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics
business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue;
and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue. Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared
with three months ended December 31, 2011 MBD revenue decreased, due mainly to the deferral of $689 million of revenue related
to the Office Upgrade Offer and $99 million of revenue related to Office Pre-Sales. This decrease was offset in part by overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $196 million or 4%, primarily reflecting
growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and a 12% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $815 million or 67%, driven primarily by the Office Deferral. MBD revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2012 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $103 million. MBD operating income decreased, mainly due to lower revenue. MBD revenue decreased, due mainly to the deferral of $876 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer and $101 million of revenue
related to Office Pre-Sales. This decrease was offset in part by overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $339 million or 4%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and an
11% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 47%, driven by the Office Deferral and a decline in the x86 PC market. MBD revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2012 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $222 million. MBD operating income decreased, mainly due to lower revenue, offset in part by lower research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $78 million or 8%, primarily due to the

Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD) develops and markets products and services designed to
entertain and connect people. EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our
Internet protocol television software), Skype, and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. We acquired Skype on October 13, 2011, and its results of operations from that date are reflected in our results discussed below.

Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended December 31, 2011
EDD revenue decreased, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 platform revenue, offset in part by higher Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360
platform revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 29%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 5.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal
year 2013, compared with 8.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Video game revenue decreased, primarily due to $380 million of revenue deferred associated with the Video Game Deferral. Windows Phone revenue
increased $546 million, including patent licensing revenue and increased sales of Windows Phone licenses. EDD operating income
increased, due mainly to lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue and increased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $544 million or 19%, mainly due to decreased sales of
Xbox 360 consoles, offset in part by payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and increased royalties on Xbox LIVE content and video games. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $92 million or 21%, primarily reflecting
decreased Xbox 360 platform marketing. Research and development expenses increased $98 million or 25%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses. EDD revenue decreased, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 platform revenue, offset in part by higher Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue
decreased $1.5 billion or 27%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 7.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2013, compared
with 10.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2012. Video game revenue decreased, primarily due to $380 million of revenue deferred associated with the Video Game Deferral. Windows Phone revenue increased $690
million, including patent licensing revenue and higher sales of Windows Phone licenses. EDD operating income decreased, due mainly to
lower revenue and higher research and development expenses, offset in part by lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Research and development expenses increased $235 million or 33%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related
expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $392 million or 10%, mainly due to lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles, offset in part by payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $90 million or 14%,
primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 platform marketing. Corporate-Level Activity

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold, including Xbox and Surface, and
programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space
(traffic acquisition costs); costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and
the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. Cost of revenue increased reflecting costs to manufacture Surface,
higher headcount-related expenses, and payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, offset in part by lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Headcount-related expenses increased 17% and 13% for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2012, respectively, primarily related to increased Server and Tools headcount.

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and
credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by
unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities, offset in part by lower
other-than-temporary impairments. Net losses on derivatives decreased, due to lower losses on foreign currency derivatives and gains on equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period, offset in part by losses
on commodity and interest-rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the comparable period. Six months ended December 31,
2012 compared with six months ended December 31, 2011 Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to lower
gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Net losses on derivatives decreased, due to gains on commodity and equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the
comparable period, offset in part by higher losses on foreign currency derivatives and lower gains on interest-rate derivatives. For the six months ended December 31, 2012, other includes a gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share
in the MSNBC joint venture.

Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were approximately 18% and 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 18% and 20% for the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign
regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates. The current quarter effective
tax rate is lower than our prior years second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to adjustments to prior year tax provision estimates and a favorable state court ruling. The current year effective tax rate is lower than our prior year
effective tax rate, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our foreign tax provisions. Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively,
and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its
2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of December 31, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved
favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within
the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $68.3 billion as of December 31, 2012, compared with $63.0 billion as of June 30, 2012. Equity and other investments were $10.7 billion as of
December 31, 2012, compared with $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income
securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments
are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these
investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of
December 31, 2012 does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities is collateralized by prime residential
mortgages and carries a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers
and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material. Of the cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments at December 31, 2012, approximately $61 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign
subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $579 million. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 84% of the short-term investments held by our foreign
subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S.
dollars. Securities lending We
lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities
with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the

borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $21 million as of December 31, 2012. Our average and maximum
securities lending payable balances for the three months ended December 31, 2012 were $174 million and $455 million, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the six months ended December 31, 2012 were
$509 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S.
treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are
observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued
using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for
their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the
market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of
our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are
recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations decreased $1.1 billion to $13.3 billion for the six
months ended December 31, 2012, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets, offset in part by increased cash collections from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.4 billion to
$3.9 billion, due mainly to $2.2 billion in proceeds from issuance of debt, offset in part by a $585 million increase in dividends paid and a $314 million increase in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $2.4
billion to $10.3 billion, due mainly to a $9.4 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales and a $599 million increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment, offset in part by an $8.0 billion
decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and intangible and other assets. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate
environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14.2
billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

 In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt outstanding.  Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of December 31, 2012, the
aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $62 million. Notes The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. Convertible Debt In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal
amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt
agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $9 million. Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsofts common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On
or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of
our common stock, at our election. Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to
separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated
between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.

Item 2

In connection with issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain
option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we
purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap
price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders equity. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue at
December 31, 2012 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement
or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2012 also included payments for: the Windows
Upgrade Offer; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; the Office Deferral; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; the Video Game Deferral; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid
credits and subscriptions; OEM minimum commitments; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2012:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material
impact on our financial statements during the periods presented. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to
property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales
and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital
resources. Liquidity We earn a
significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from
operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at
least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating
activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could
elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We
have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING
GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill
impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its
carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other
comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but
consecutive statements. The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which
other comprehensive income is presented. This guidance was amended in December 2011 when the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers presentation of reclassification adjustments. We adopted this new amended guidance beginning July 1,
2012. Adoption of this new amended guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.

PART I
Item 2

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related
arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and
the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities,
goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Revenue Recognition Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether
vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify
VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or
upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Windows 7 revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer,
which started June 2, 2012. The offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchase Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft is responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to
the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires. Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Office Upgrade Offer, which started October 19, 2012. The Office Upgrade Offer allows customers who purchase qualifying 2010 Microsoft
Office system or Office for Mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to Office 365 Home Premium or the equivalent version of 2013 Microsoft Office system upon general availability. Small business customers in applicable
markets will also be eligible for a three-month trial of Office 365 Small Business Premium. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 Microsoft Office system and subscription services is deferred until the products and services
are delivered or the redemption period expires. Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this
judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among
other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For
fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial
health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment
charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting
units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative

46


Table of Contents
PART I
Item 2

fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and
between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business
climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units,
and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which
is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and
other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a
computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general
release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have
been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes
of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been
impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss
should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes The objectives of
accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial
statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides
guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is
required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of
stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion
of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and
use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio
is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and
domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of
global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
Commodity We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global
commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
VALUE-AT-RISK
We use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level,
in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical
volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are
not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.

Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $392 million at December 31, 2012 and $292 million at
June 30, 2012. The total VaR is 24% less at December 31, 2012, and 26% less at June 30, 2012, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are
effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
See Note 15  Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to
lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector.    Our competitors range in
size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers
to entry in our businesses generally are low and software products can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs,
and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices.    An important element of our business model has been to create
platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing
significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain competitive margins. The strategic importance of a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8

49

Item 1A

operating system, Surface, and associated cloud-based services. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications and services. 

 

 
 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has been
successful with some consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones, gaming consoles, and digital music players. These competitors also earn revenue from services that are integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also
offer vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors have been in the market longer and in some cases have established significantly large user bases. Efforts to compete with the vertically integrated
model will increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. 

 

 
 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. The proliferation of alternative devices and form factors, in
particular mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, creates challenges from competing software platforms. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users may
increasingly turn to these devices to perform functions that would have been performed by personal computers in the past. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more
difficult to attract applications developers to our platforms. In addition, Surface competes with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. 

 

 
 Competing platforms have applications marketplaces (sometimes referred to as stores) with scale and significant installed bases on mobile devices.
These applications leverage free and user-paid services that over time result in disincentives for users to switch to competing platforms. In order to compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and
ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with these application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Business model competition.    Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. 

 

 
 Under the license-based proprietary software model that generates most of our revenue, we bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products
through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model and we expect this
competition to continue. 

 

 
 Other competitors develop and offer free online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenues fund development
of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. 

 

 
 Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users and
earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality
of our products. The competitive pressures described above may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions,
and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on devices and services presents execution and competitive risks.    A growing part of our strategy involves cloud-based services used with smart client devices. Our
competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the
users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based strategies. While we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of
our cloud-based services provide us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. In addition to software development costs, we are incurring
costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of
areas, including:







50


Table of Contents

Item 1A


 
 continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share; 

 

 
 maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,
tablets, and television-related devices; 

 

 
 continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers; and 

 

 
 ensuring that our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.
We make significant investments in new products and services that may not be
profitable.    We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system,
Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Windows Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox 360 entertainment platform. We will continue to invest in new software and hardware products,
services, and technologies, such as the Microsoft-designed and manufactured Surface launched in October 2012. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and
effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue.
We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins
for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. In October 2012 we launched
Windows 8, a major new release of our PC operating system, and Surface, which seek to deliver a unique user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. Their success depends on a number of factors including the extent
to which customers embrace the new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our OEM partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of new features, and attracting developers at scale to ensure a
competitive array of quality applications. We expect to incur substantial marketing costs in promoting Windows 8 and associated services and devices, which may reduce our operating margins. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.    Protecting our global intellectual
property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in
countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. As a result, our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying PC market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure
consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the
advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could
adversely affect revenue. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.    From
time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of
existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of Microsoft-branded services and hardware devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less
favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. In addition to money
damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be
issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to
procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk. We may not be able to protect our source code from
copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of
our application and operating system source code to a




51


Table of Contents
PART II
Item 1A

number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we
could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.
Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph. Cyber-attacks and security
vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. Security
of Microsofts information technology.    Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers. Threats to information technology (IT) security can take a variety
of forms. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. Groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch
distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks. Sophisticated organizations or individuals may launch targeted attacks using novel methods to gain access to computers running our software. These threats may result in breaches of
our network or data security, disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, product development delays, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of
confidential business information, theft or misuse of intellectual property, or other negative impacts on our business. In addition,
our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking
and other consumer-oriented technologies. These practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes.
Security of our customers products and services.    Security threats are a particular challenge to
companies like us whose business is technology products and services. The threats to our own IT infrastructure also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our
services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect them to continue to do so. The security of our products and services
is an important consideration in our customers purchasing decisions. We devote significant resources to defend against security
threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers. These include: 

 

 
 engineering more secure products and services; 

 

 
 enhancing security and reliability features in our products and services, and continuously evaluating and updating those security and reliability features;


 

 
 improving the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities; 

 

 
 investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed;


 

 
 protecting the digital security infrastructure that ensures the integrity of our products and services; 

 

 
 helping our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks; and 

 

 
 providing customers online automated security tools, published security guidance, and security software such as firewalls and anti-virus software.
The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual or perceived security
vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also
increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived
vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.
Legislative or regulatory action may increase the costs to develop or implement our products and services.

Item 1A

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our
reputation.    As we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers.
At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of
security controls across our business groups and geographies. Despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the
improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that
protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. We believe
consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. Perceptions that our products or services
do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of our cloud-based solutions. We may experience outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations
infrastructure.    Our increasing user traffic and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers
and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online,
Office 365, SharePoint Online, SkyDrive, Skype, Xbox LIVE, Windows Azure, Outlook, and Microsoft Office Web Apps. We also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their
end customers. Maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user
experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial
condition. We are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our
products.    As a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or
consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, we have been involved in the following actions. Lawsuits brought
by the U.S. Department of Justice, 18 states, and the District of Columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a Consent Decree that took effect in 2001 and a Final Judgment entered in 2002. These proceedings imposed various constraints on
our Windows operating system businesses. These constraints included limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of
certain Windows features in new PCs. Although the Consent Decree and Final Judgment expired in May 2011, we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business. The European Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used
in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our
competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commissions concerns
relating to competition in Web browsing software. The Commissions impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our
product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of
our products.

Item 1A

Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide
the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants,
including with respect to new versions of Windows or other Microsoft products. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: 

 

 
 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products
to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 

 

 
 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our
associated intellectual property. 

 

 
 The rulings described above may be used as precedent in other competition law proceedings. 

 

 
 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments as a result of court or administrative orders, consent decrees or other voluntary actions we have taken. If
we fail to comply with these commitments we may incur litigation costs and be subject to fines or other remedial actions. For example, in July 2012 we announced that, for some PCs sold in Europe, we were not in compliance with our 2009 agreement to
display a Browser Choice Screen on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser. Our
products and online services offerings, including new technologies we develop or acquire such as Skype, are subject to government regulation in some jurisdictions, including in areas of user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online
content. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally these laws and governments approach to their
enforcement, as well as our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance
could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Our business depends on our
ability to attract and retain talented employees.    Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely
competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver
successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our
strategic planning and execution. Delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our
revenue.    The development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Our increasing focus on devices
and cloud-based services also presents new and complex development issues. Significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.    Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation,
recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those
products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) building devices that run our software have also
been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could result in sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair
the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and
maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio consists of U.S.
government securities. If global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if there is a downgrade of U.S. government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our
investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.

Item 1A

We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse
outcomes.    We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to
conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period
in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax
liabilities.    We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any
related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that
determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds
currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational
corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    Our vertically-integrated hardware
products such as the Xbox 360 console, Surface, and other hardware devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and
reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their
demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available to us. If a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement
supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox 360 consoles and Surface are assembled in Asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in shortages that
would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. Our stand-alone software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended
operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could result in reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although
our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.    We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may
not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our amortizable intangible assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of
our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant
charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. For example, in July 2012, we announced a $6.2 billion
charge for the impairment of goodwill in our Online Services Division business segment. We operate a global business that exposes us
to additional risks.    We operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. Pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our
software in the U.S. and other countries. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks.

or economic conditions in a specific country or region, such as current uncertainties relating to European economic weakness, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, may
also adversely affect our operations or financial results. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net
revenue. Catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.    A disruption or
failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical
functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon
Valley area of California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal
business operations. Our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact
of prolonged service outages on our operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also
may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of
climate change on the global economy in general or the information technology industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods
and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. New
regulations may require us to find alternative compliant and cost-effective methods of distributing our products and services. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.    We expect to
continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business
strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of managements attention from our other businesses. Our
acquisition of Skype, for example, provides opportunities to enhance our existing products. The success of our integration of Skype will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our competitors in both
consumer and business markets. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or market share, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or
may not be realized. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition.

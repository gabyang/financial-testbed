NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding:
•the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
•our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, systems, facilities, and infrastructure, to continue to hire aggressively and provide competitive compensation programs, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions;
•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality, and macroeconomic conditions, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
•the potential for declines in our revenue growth rate;
•our expectation that we will continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads we deliver and to reduce the number of accidental clicks;
•fluctuations in the rate of change in revenue and revenue growth, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and average cost-per-click and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
•our expectation that our foreign exchange risk management program will not fully offset our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•the expected variability of costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
•our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues;
•our potential exposure in connection with pending investigations, proceedings, and other contingencies;
•our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins in the future;
•our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs will increase in the future;
•our expectation that our results will be impacted by our performance in international markets as users in developing economies increasingly come online;
•our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues will continue to increase;
•our expectation that our other income (loss), net, will fluctuate in the future as it is largely driven by market dynamics;
•estimates of our future compensation expenses;
•fluctuations in our effective tax rate;
•the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
•our payment terms to certain advertisers, which may increase our working capital requirements;
•fluctuations in our capital expenditures;

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

Note 1.    Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Google Inc. (Google) was incorporated in California in 1998 and re-incorporated in Delaware in 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google.We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and all wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as all variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2017, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of September 30, 2017, our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, and our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on February 2, 2017.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial assets and financial liabilities including cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes, as well as on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The most significant impact to our consolidated financial statements relates to the recognition and measurement of equity investments at fair value in our consolidated statement of income. We expect to elect the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted by observable price changes. We anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will increase the volatility of our other income (expense), net, as a result of the remeasurement of our equity securities upon the occurrence of observable price changes and impairments.In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) "Leases." Topic 842 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, "Leases." Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. Topic 842 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption by public entities is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and there are certain optional practical expedients that an entity may elect to apply. Full retrospective application is prohibited. We anticipate that the adoption of Topic 842 will materially affect our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are in the process of implementing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of existing lease agreements. We plan to adopt Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019 and we are evaluating the use of the optional practical expedients.In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16 (ASU 2016-16) "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory." ASU 2016-16 generally accelerates the recognition of income tax consequences for asset transfers between entities under common control. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities are required to adopt using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings for previously unrecognized income tax expense. We anticipate a retained earnings adjustment of $600 million to $800 million upon adoption related to the unrecognized income tax effects of asset transfers that occurred prior to adoption.In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04 (ASU 2017-04) “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two of the goodwill impairment test and specifies that goodwill impairment should be measured by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Additionally, the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets should be disclosed. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted. We currently anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition” (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2017 using the modified retrospective transition method. See Note 2 for further details.In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01 (ASU 2017-01) “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” ASU 2017-01 provides guidance to evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired (or disposed of) are not considered a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

Note 2.    Revenues
Adoption of ASC Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"
On January 1, 2017, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2017. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2017 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605.We recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of $15 million as of January 1, 2017 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to our non-advertising revenues. The impact to revenues as a result of applying Topic 606 was an increase of $10 million and $32 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source (in millions, unaudited). Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.

(1) Regions represent Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Canada and Latin America (Other Americas).(2) Revenues include hedging gains (losses) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017.
Advertising Revenues
We generate revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google properties and Google Network Members’ properties.Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on Google.com, the Google app, YouTube, and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play.Google Network Members’ properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated from placing ads on Google Network Members’ properties.Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through AdWords, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and DoubleClick AdExchange, among others.Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis (CPC), which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on an ad on Google properties or Google Network Members' properties or views certain YouTube ad formats like TrueView. For these customers, we recognize revenue each time a user clicks on the ad or when a user views the ad for a specified period of time.We also offer advertising on other bases such as cost-per-impression (CPM), which means an advertiser pays us based on the number of times their ads are displayed on Google properties or Google Network Members’ properties. For these customers, we recognize revenue each time an ad is displayed.Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.For ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.
Other Revenues
Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from:•Apps, in-app purchases, and digital content in the Google Play store;•Google Cloud offerings;•Hardware; and•Other miscellaneous products and services.As it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a commission. Consequently, the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues.

Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.
Deferred Revenues
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 is primarily driven by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $779 million of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2016.Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions
We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

Note 3.    Financial Instruments

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.

Those losses are included in gain (loss) on marketable securities, net, as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as discussed below.We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $362 million and $47 million, respectively.
Cash Flow Hedges
We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and at times we use interest rate swaps to effectively lock interest rates on anticipated debt issuances. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $10.7 billion and $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.We reflect gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. For foreign currency collars, we include the change in time value in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. For forwards and all other option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes of the excluded components in other income (expense), net.As of September 30, 2017, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was a net accumulated loss of $440 million, of which a net loss of $473 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts was $7.9 billion and $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.The fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):

Note 4.    Non-Marketable Investments
Our non-marketable investments include non-marketable equity investments and non-marketable debt securities.
Non-Marketable Equity Investments
Our non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method and are not required to be consolidated under the variable interest or voting models. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments including impairment was a net loss of approximately $61 million and $31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and a net loss of $209 million and $93 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $3.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, and a fair value of approximately $8.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. The fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data leveraging private-market transactions and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We reflect our share of equity method investee earnings and losses and impairments of non-marketable equity investments as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the equity method are variable interest entities (VIE). These entities' activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact the VIE's economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our financial statements. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these VIEs were $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2017. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date.  We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in these entities. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, and vice versa, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure.

Non-Marketable Debt Securities
Our non-marketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible notes issued by private companies. The cost of these securities were $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017. These debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date. No significant impairments were recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017.The following table presents a reconciliation for our non-marketable debt securities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions, unaudited):

Short-Term Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017.

Long-Term Debt
Google issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in three tranches (collectively, 2011 Notes) in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2014 Notes) in February 2014 due in 2024.In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024 (collectively, the Google Notes). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized. In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2016 Notes) due 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinate to the outstanding Google Notes. The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions):

Note 7.    Acquisitions
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we completed various acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $312 million. In aggregate, $12 million was cash acquired, $111 million was attributed to intangible assets, $205 million was attributed to goodwill, and $16 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $24 million.Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 3.9 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 3.1 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 8.8 years.

Note 8.    Calico
In September 2013, we announced the formation of Calico, a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. As of September 30, 2017, we have contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis.Calico is a VIE and its results of operations and statement of financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. As of September 30, 2017, AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement, which reflects its total commitment. As of September 30, 2017, Calico has contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million.Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico over the next few years.

Note 9.    Verily
Verily is a life science company with a mission to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. Verily is a VIE and its results of operations and statement of financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance.In January 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase a noncontrolling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. In the first quarter of 2017, the first tranche of the investment closed and we received $480 million. The second and final tranche of the investment closed in the third quarter of 2017 and we received the remaining $320 million. The transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized. Of the $800 million received, $78 million was recorded as noncontrolling interest and $722 million was recorded as additional paid-in capital. Noncontrolling interest and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest were not separately presented on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 as the amounts were not material.

Note 11.    Contingencies
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results and ads, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and ads. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.42 billion (approximately $2.74 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of approximately $2.74 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. The fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine.On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search. We responded to the SOs and continue to respond to the EC's informational requests. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcomes of these investigations; however, adverse decisions could result in fines and directives to alter or terminate certain conduct. Given the nature of these cases, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or ranges of loss, if any. We remain committed to working with the EC to resolve these matters.The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Korean Fair Trade Commission have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In November 2016, we responded to the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle has appealed. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.
Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

Indirect Taxes and Other Non-Income Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to indirect tax and other non-income tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax and other non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue indirect taxes and other non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14.

Share Repurchases
In October 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired 3.1 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion.

Note 14.    Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $5.4 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the United States.In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust the provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.We have received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend against any and all such claims as presented. While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters.For information regarding indirect taxes and other non-income taxes, see Note 11.

Note 15.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets.Our reported segments are described below:•Google – Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, and Google Play as well as our hardware initiatives. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content; services fees for cloud offerings; and sales of hardware products. •Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Google Fiber, sales of Nest products and services, and licensing and R&D services through Verily. Revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented separately, as these amounts are immaterial. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation.Information about segments during the periods presented were as follows (in millions, unaudited):

Information about Segments
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets.Our reported segments are described below:•Google – Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, and Google Play as well as our hardware initiatives. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content; services fees for cloud offerings; and sales of hardware products. •Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Google Fiber, sales of Nest products and services, and licensing and R&D services through Verily. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation.

Use of Monetization Metrics
When assessing our advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the percentage change in the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our Google properties and Google Network Members' properties. Management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads like TrueView (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). Paid clicks for our Google Network Members' properties include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and AdMob. In some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we primarily charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.We periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.In the first quarter of 2017, we refined our methodology for paid clicks and cost-per-click to include additional categories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats. This change resulted in a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click. For comparison purposes, we have included updated data for historical periods in the table below:

Our advertising revenue growth and the change in advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:•growth rates of revenues from Google properties, including YouTube, compared to growth rates of revenues from Google Network Members' properties;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•changes in device mix;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;•a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenues generated on Google properties and Google Network Members' properties, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and•general economic conditions.Our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues that are generated on:•Google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;•Other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and•YouTube, including but not limited to, YouTube TrueView and Google Preferred.Our Google properties revenues increased $3,634 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also experienced growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery, as well as growth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising. Our Google properties revenues increased $9,734 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also experienced growth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising. The growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to growth in YouTube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. The positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. The decrease in cost-per-click was also impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Google Network Members' properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Member properties through:•AdMob;•AdSense (such as AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, etc.); and•DoubleClick AdExchange.Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $610 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by strength in both programmatic advertising buying and AdMob. Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $1,430 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by strength in both programmatic advertising buying and AdMob, offset by a decline in our traditional AdSense businesses and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The increase in paid clicks from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 resulted primarily from growth in AdMob and an increase from our traditional AdSense for Search business. The positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth
The impact of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period.Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.The following table presents the foreign exchange impact on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited):

For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our revenues from APAC were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the Australian dollar, South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.For the three months ended September 30, 2017, our revenues from Other Americas were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, and Mexican peso partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our revenues from Other Americas were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the Brazilian real.

Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs (TAC) which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•The expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor including SBC, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs); •Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •Inventory related costs for hardware we sell; and•Amortization of certain intangible assets. The following tables present our costs of revenues, including traffic acquisition costs (in millions, unaudited):

Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.

The cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on the properties of our Google Network Members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’ properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.Cost of revenues increased $2,449 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017 and increased $6,839 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to various factors, including (1) traffic acquisition costs, (2) data center costs which include depreciation, labor (including SBC), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs, (3) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube, and (4) hardware related costs.The increase in TAC to distribution partners was driven by an increase in Google properties revenues. The increase in the associated Google properties TAC rate was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The increases in TAC to Google Network Members and the associated Network Members TAC rate were driven by the continued underlying shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher TAC and the impact from sales allowances. The increase in the aggregate TAC rate was also partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Member properties to Google properties.We expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•The relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and our Google Network Members’ properties;•Traffic acquisition costs paid to our distribution partners, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•Traffic acquisition costs paid to Google Network Members, which are affected by ongoing adoption of programmatic advertising buying and changes in partner agreement terms;•The growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs; and•Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues.

R&D expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs, including SBC, for employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services and•Depreciation and equipment-related expenses.R&D expenses increased $609 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $363 million, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount, partially offset by the shift in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $206 million.R&D expenses increased $1,993 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $1,465 million, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $358 million and an increase in professional services expenses of $107 million largely due to additional expenses incurred for outsourced services.We expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $643 million, largely resulting from a 6% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $480 million, largely resulting from increases in marketing and promotion-related expenses for our hardware products.We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

General and Administrative

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in labor and facilities-related costs of $184 million, partly resulting from the shift in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle, as well as decreases in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses and reduced allocations.General and administrative expenses increased $135 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees of $160 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services and lower legal related costs in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, there was an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $59 million, largely resulting from a 12% increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by decreases in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses and reduced allocations.We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

European Commission Fine
On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.42 billion (approximately $2.74 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine, which was accrued in the second quarter of 2017.

Other Income (Expense), Net
The following table presents other income (expense), net (in millions, unaudited):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2017 2016 2017Other income (expense), net$278 $197 $216 $693Other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues1.2% 0.7% 0.3% 0.9%
Other income (expense), net, decreased $81 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by losses recorded related to marketable and non-marketable investments. These losses were offset by reduced costs of our foreign currency hedging activities.Other income (expense), net, increased $477 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by reduced costs of our foreign currency hedging activities and decreased losses on marketable investments.The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of foreign exchange rates relative to the contract prices, the volatility of foreign exchange rates, and forward points. The hedging costs expensed in other income (expense), net, decreased as a result of less option premiums paid after we began to use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our forecasted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016.We expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount in future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics.

Provision for Income Taxes
The following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions, unaudited) and effective tax rate:

Our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of a proportionate decrease in unrecognized tax benefits offset by other miscellaneous items. Our provision for income taxes increased from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of an increase in taxable income year over year.Our effective tax rate remained flat from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our provision for income taxes increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of an increase in taxable income year over year.Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
As of September 30, 2017, we had $100.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.As of September 30, 2017, $60.5 billion of the $100.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2017. We have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of September 30, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2017, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $4.0 billion.In October 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C capital stock. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired 3.1 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion. In January 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase a non-controlling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. We received the first tranche of $480 million in the first quarter of 2017 and the final tranche of $320 million in the third quarter of 2017. In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with HTC Corporation (HTC) to acquire a team of engineers and a non-exclusive license for HTC intellectual property for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close in early 2018.At December 31, 2016, we had a $1.4 billion interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note (Note Receivable) due October 2017. The Note Receivable was fully repaid in May 2017.For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, our cash flows were as follows (in millions, unaudited):
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$26,623 $26,823Net cash used in investing activities$(26,463) $(24,427)Net cash used in financing activities$(7,440) $(5,120)
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google properties and Google Network Members' properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases and digital content, hardware products, licensing arrangements, and service fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and Google other revenues (net of payouts to app developers) offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, and income taxes.

Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable and non-marketable securities, payments for acquisitions, and proceeds from the collection of notes receivable.Net cash used in investing activities decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities, decreases in cash collateral paid related to securities lending, and increases in cash proceeds received from the collection of the Lenovo note receivable. These items were offset by increases in purchases of marketable securities and increases in purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by or used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities, and proceeds from the sale of subsidiary shares.Net cash used in financing activities decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 primarily driven by decreases in the repayment of debt, decreases in repurchases of capital stock, and increases in proceeds from the sale of subsidiary shares. These items were offset by decreases in proceeds received from the issuance of debt and increases in net payments related to stock-based award activities.

Contractual Obligations
We had long-term taxes payable of $4.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
Revenues
For the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.See Note 1 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, see Part I, Item 7, "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. In general, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. As of September 30, 2017, our most significant currency exposures are the British pound, Euro, and Japanese yen.We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency options and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We record the effective portion of these contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. For foreign currency collars, we include the change in time value in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. For forwards and all other option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes of the excluded components in other income (expense), net.We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of September 30, 2017, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $1.1 billion lower as of September 30, 2017. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in the forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.In addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $65 million as of September 30, 2017. The adverse impact as of September 30, 2017 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $325 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the month of September 30, 2017.
Interest Rate Risk
Our investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. We considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2017.

ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

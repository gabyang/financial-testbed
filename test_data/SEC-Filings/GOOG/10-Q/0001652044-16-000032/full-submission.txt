•the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
•our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products and technologies, systems, facilities, and infrastructure, to continue to hire aggressively and provide competitive compensation programs, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions;
•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, traditional retail seasonality and macroeconomic conditions, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
•the potential for declines in our revenue growth rate;
•our expectation that growth in advertising revenues from our websites will continue to exceed that from our Google Network Members' websites, which will have a positive impact on our operating margins;
•our expectation that we will continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads we deliver and to reduce the number of accidental clicks;
•fluctuations in the rate of change in revenue and revenue growth, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and average cost-per-click and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
•our belief that our foreign exchange risk management program will not fully offset our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•the expected variability of costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
•our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues;
•our potential exposure in connection with pending investigations, proceedings, and other contingencies;
•our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs will increase in the future;

•estimates of our future compensation expenses;
•fluctuations in our effective tax rate;
•the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
•our payment terms to certain advertisers, which may increase our working capital requirements;
•fluctuations in our capital expenditures;

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

Note 1.    Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2015. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.On October 2, 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization in which Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google Inc. (Google) that was accounted for as a merger under common control. Alphabet has recognized the assets and liabilities of Google at carryover basis. The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet present comparative information for the prior periods on a combined basis, as if both Alphabet and Google were under common control for all periods presented.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alphabet Inc., our subsidiaries, as well as all variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of June 30, 2016, our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, and our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2016 as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2016.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience, future projections, market transactions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes, as well as, on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value.Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when they transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued and amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, implementing accounting system changes related to the adoption, and considering additional disclosure requirements.In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to our consolidated financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the recognition and measurement for equity investments. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 will impact the disclosure and presentation of financial assets and liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption by public entities is permitted only for certain provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02) which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created Topic 842, "Leases."  Under Topic 842, lessees  are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provides for enhanced disclosures.  Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited and early adoption by public entities is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.    Financial Instruments

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.

Securities Lending Program
From time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan certain securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is usually invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities. We classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default. Our securities lending transactions were accounted for as secured borrowings with significant investment categories as follows (in millions):

Derivative Financial Instruments
We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as other income (expense), net, revenues, or accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below.We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $192 million and $150 million.

Cash Flow Hedges
We use options to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and at times we use interest rate swaps to effectively lock interest rates on anticipated debt issuances. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $16.4 billion and $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively. These contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.We reflect gains or losses on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in other income (expense), net.As of June 30, 2016, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $313 million, of which $255 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude the difference between spot rates and forward rates for these forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively. We have used interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $295 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively.Gains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. Cash flows from these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are reported within investment activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the impact of the hedged items.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $7.5 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively.We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, in other income (expense), net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into other income (expense), net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $50 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively.The fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):

Note 3.    Non-Marketable Investments
Our non-marketable investments include non-marketable equity investments and non-marketable debt securities.
Non-Marketable Equity Investments
Our non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method and are not required to be consolidated under the variable interest or voting models. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments was a net loss of approximately $59 million and $89 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and $43 million and $148 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. We reflect these losses as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and a fair value of approximately $7.5 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. The fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data leveraging private-market transactions and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We periodically review our non-marketable equity investments for impairment. No material impairments were recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016. Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments are variable interest entities (VIEs). Our involvement with investments in renewable energy relate to our equity investments in entities whose activities involve power generation. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact the entity's economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. We account for these investments under the equity method. The carrying value of our renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method that are VIEs is $1.3 billion with the maximum exposure of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $1.3 billion with the maximum exposure of $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2016, respectively.  The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date plus future funding commitments.  We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in these entities. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs and vice versa, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure.

Non-Marketable Debt Securities
Our non-marketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible notes issued by private companies. The cost of these securities was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively. These debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date. No material impairments were recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016. The following table presents a reconciliation for our non-marketable debt securities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions, unaudited):

Note 4.    Debt
Short-Term Debt
Google had a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper and a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. In February 2016, we replaced Google's existing debt financing program with a new short-term debt financing program that allows us to issue up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper from time to time and to draw on a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2021. Net proceeds from these programs are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, we had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016. The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016. In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property which expires in 2028. We intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in the second half of 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016.
Long-Term Debt
Google issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the "2011 Notes") in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the "2014 Notes") in February 2014 due 2024. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes were used for the repayment of the portion of the principal amount of our 2011 Notes which matured on May 19, 2014 and for general corporate purposes. We repaid $1.0 billion of the 2011 Notes in May 2016.In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 3.625% Notes due 2021 and 3.375% Notes due 2024 (collectively, the "Google Notes"). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of the notes of Alphabet with identical interest rate and maturity (the "Alphabet Notes"). Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gains or losses recognized. The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions):

The Alphabet Notes due in 2021 and 2024 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinated to the Google Notes.  We may redeem these Notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 6.    Calico
On September 18, 2013, we announced the formation of Calico, a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. As of June 30, 2016, we have contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and have also committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis.Calico is a VIE and its results of operations and statement of financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. As of June 30, 2016, AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement, which reflects its total commitment. As of June 30, 2016, Calico has contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million.Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico over the next few years.

Note 9.    Contingencies
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search. We will respond to the SOs and Supplementary SO and will continue to cooperate with the EC.The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of the Russian Federation have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In August 2015, we received the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. In September 2015, FAS found that there has been a competition law infringement in Android mobile distribution. We will respond to the CCI's report and are appealing the FAS decision.The state attorney general from Mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices. We have responded to those subpoenas, and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the case is pending post-trial motions and any further appeals by Oracle. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.

Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Indirect Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arise from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions. We accrue indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. For certain matters, while the loss is reasonably possible, the loss or range of loss cannot be estimated. We believe these matters are without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 12.

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Class C Adjustment Payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. The weighted-average share impact of the Class C Adjustment Payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.

Awards which we expect to be ultimately settled in cash are classified as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Beginning in Q1 2016, we account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a $133 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016.

As of June 30, 2016, there was $11.0 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.
Share Repurchases
In October 2015, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. In January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares. The repurchases were being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 5.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $3.7 billion. As of June 30, 2016, we completed all authorized share repurchases under our repurchase program.

Note 12.    Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016. Our existing tax positions will continue to generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the United States.In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust the provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.We have received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend against any and all such claims as presented. While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters.For information regarding indirect taxes, see Note 9.

Note 13.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, these operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets.Our reported segments are described below:•Google – Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome, Google Play as well as hardware products we sell, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus devices. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like Virtual Reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising, sales of digital content, apps and cloud offerings for enterprise, and sales of hardware.•Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X, and other initiatives. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of Nest hardware products, internet and TV services through Google Fiber, and licensing and R&D services through Verily.Revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented separately, as these amounts are immaterial. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation.Information about segments during the periods presented were as follows (in millions, unaudited):

Information about Segments
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, these operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets.Our reported segments are described below:•Google – Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome, Google Play as well as hardware products we sell, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus devices. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like Virtual Reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising, sales of digital content, apps and cloud offerings for enterprise, and sales of hardware.•Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X, and other initiatives. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of Nest hardware products, internet and TV services through Google Fiber, and licensing and R&D services through Verily.Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information about our segments.

Use of Monetization Metrics
When assessing our advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our Google websites and Google Network Members websites. Management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. We periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.Paid clicks for our Google websites represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Finance, Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads like TrueView (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). Paid clicks for our Google Network Members' websites include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content and AdMob businesses. In some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our advertising revenue base. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average cost we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.The rate of change in revenue and revenue growth, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including:•growth rates of our revenues from Google websites, including YouTube, compared to those of our revenues from Google Network Members' websites;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;•a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated in Google websites and Google Network Members' websites, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and•general economic conditions.Our advertising revenue growth rate has generally declined over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Google websites
The following table presents our Google websites revenues (in millions) and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) for the periods presented:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2016 2015 2016 (unaudited)Google websites$12,402 $15,400 $24,334 $29,728Google websites as a percentage of Google segment revenues70.3% 72.2 % 69.9% 71.8 %Paid clicks change  37 %   38 %Cost-per-click change  (9)%   (10)%
Google websites revenues consist primarily of:•AdWords revenue that is generated on Google.com. This includes revenue from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;•Advertising revenue generated on YouTube, including, but not limited to YouTube TrueView and Google Preferred; and•Advertising revenue generated from other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Finance, Maps, and Google Play.Our Google websites revenues increased $2,998 million from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 and increased $5,394 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Our Google websites revenues also increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. Our Google websites revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search most notably due to the improvements in ad formats and delivery launched in Q3 2015. We also experienced growth in desktop and tablet search due to improvement in ad format, as well as growth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs increased due to growth in the adoption of YouTube engagement ads, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. The positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other platforms, and also impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
Google Network Members' websites

Google Network Members' websites revenues consist primarily of:•AdSense (such as AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, etc.);•AdExchange;•AdMob; and•All DoubleClick-related revenues including DoubleClick Bid Manager revenues.Our Google Network Members' websites revenues increased $122 million from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 and increased $238 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The growth was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying, offset by our traditional network businesses and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The decrease in Network Members' websites revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of Network Members' websites revenues compared to that of Google websites revenues as well as Google other revenues.The change in paid clicks and decrease in cost-per-click paid by our advertisers resulted from ongoing product and policy changes, changes in property and device mix, product mix, and geographic mix, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Google other revenues consist primarily of:•Sales of apps and media content in the Google Play store;•Sales of certain hardware, such as Chromecast;•Service fees received for cloud and apps and our Maps API; and•Licensing-related revenue.Our Google other revenues increased $542 million from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 and increased $944 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Google other revenues increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues.  These increases were primarily due to the growth in revenues from cloud and apps offerings for enterprise as well as Google Play, primarily relating to apps (revenues which we recognize net of payout to developers).  In addition, there was an increase in revenues from hardware sales.

Our Other Bets revenues increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues. These increases were primarily driven by sales of Nest branded hardware and revenues from licensing and R&D services.  In addition, there was an increase in revenues from internet and TV services.Due to the early stage of our Other Bets businesses and because our Other Bets revenues aggregates the revenues from a number of businesses operating in different industries, our Other Bets revenues may fluctuate for the remainder of 2016 and in future periods. Additionally, our Other Bets revenues may fluctuate due to one-time items.

Use of Constant Currency and Constant Currency Growth
The impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons.  Our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current period.Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.The following table presents our foreign exchange impact on United Kingdom revenues, Rest of the world revenues, and total consolidated revenues for the current period (in millions):

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our revenues from the United Kingdom were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the British pound.For the three months ended June 30, 2016 our revenues from the Rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to various currencies including the Brazilian Real, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro and the Japanese Yen. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 our revenues from the Rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the Euro and Brazilian Real, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese Yen.

Consolidated Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs (TAC) which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and amounts paid to our distribution partners. TAC paid to our distribution partners includes amounts paid to make available our access points and services. Our distribution partners include software developers, browser providers, mobile carriers, and original equipment manufacturers. TAC paid to our Google Network Members are the revenue share payments we make to those parties that allow us to place ads on their websites.Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•The expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs); •Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we share the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);•Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •Stock-based compensation expense;•Inventory costs for hardware we sell; and•Amortization of certain intangible assets. The following tables present our cost of revenues as well as our traffic acquisition costs for the periods presented (in millions):

The cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed through our AdSense program on the websites of our Google Network Members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from Google websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period.Cost of revenues increased $1,547 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 and increased $2,839 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. These increases in dollar amounts were primarily driven by increases in traffic acquisition costs of $598 million and $1,041 million, respectively, resulting from more fees paid to our distribution partners and our Network Members driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues. The decrease in aggregate TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix from Google Network Members' websites revenue to Google websites revenue. This was partially offset by the impact of the increase in mobile and programmatic advertising buying, which generally carry overall higher TAC. The increases in TAC to distribution partners as a percentage of Google websites revenues were primarily driven by a shift to mobile because more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The increases in TAC to Google Network Members as a percentage of Google Network Members' websites revenues were primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying.The remaining increase in cost of revenues was due to increases in data center costs, content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube and digital content, and hardware inventory costs.  We expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the remainder of 2016 and may fluctuate in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•The relative revenue growth rates of Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites;•Traffic acquisition costs paid to our distribution partners, which are affected by changes in:◦device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet,◦partner mix,◦partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and◦the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•Traffic acquisition costs paid to Google Network Members, which are affected by ongoing adoption of programmatic advertising buying and changes in partner agreement terms;•The growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory costs; and•Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues.

R&D expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services;•Depreciation and equipment-related expenses; and•Stock-based compensation expense.R&D expenses increased $574 million and remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $218 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $163 million, both largely as a result of a 16% increase in R&D headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $127 million and an increase in professional service fees of $66 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for consulting, temporary services, and outsourced services. R&D expenses increased $1,188 million and increased slightly as a percentage of revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $560 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $293 million, both largely as a result of a 14% increase in R&D headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $200 million and an increase in professional service fees of $129 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for consulting, temporary services, and outsourced services. We expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues for the remainder of 2016 and future periods.

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions;•Advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and•Stock-based compensation expense.Sales and marketing expenses increased $335 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $136 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $42 million, largely resulting from an 11% increase in sales and marketing headcount. There was also an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $98 million and an increase in professional service fees of $26 million due to additional expenses incurred for temporary services, consulting, and outsourced services.Sales and marketing expenses increased $657 million and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $256 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $79 million, largely resulting from a 10% increase in sales and marketing headcount.  There was also an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $189 million and an increase in professional service fees of $57 million due to additional expenses incurred for temporary services, consulting, and outsourced services.We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues for the remainder of 2016 and future periods.

General and Administrative
The following table presents our general and administrative expenses (in millions) for the periods presented:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2016 2015 2016 (unaudited)General and administrative expenses$1,450 $1,624 $3,087 $3,137General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues8.2% 7.6% 8.9% 7.5%
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs for employees in our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations;•Depreciation and equipment-related expenses;•Professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services;•Amortization of certain intangible assets; and•Stock-based compensation expense.General and administrative expenses increased $174 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $89 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $81 million, largely resulting from a 13% increase in general and administrative headcount.General and administrative expenses increased $50 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $163 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $130 million, largely resulting from a 14% increase in general and administrative headcount, as well as an increase in finance and other-related expenses of $88 million. This was largely offset by a decrease in professional services fees due to lower legal-related costs and a decrease in other miscellaneous expenses.We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues for the remainder of 2016 and in future periods.

Stock-Based Compensation
The following table presents stock-based compensation expense for awards we expect to settle in equity (in millions) for the periods presented:

Stock-based compensation related to awards we expect to settle in equity increased $371 million and $662 million from the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by headcount growth. We estimate stock-based compensation expense related to awards we expect to settle in equity to be approximately $5.6 billion in 2016 and $8.4 billion thereafter related to stock-based awards outstanding as of June 30, 2016. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to stock-based awards granted after June 30, 2016.

Consolidated Other Income (Expense), Net
The following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions) for the periods presented:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2016 2015 2016 (unaudited)Other income (expense), net$131 $151 $288 $(62)Other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues0.8% 0.7% 0.8% (0.2)%
Other income (expense), net, increased $20 million from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily related to an increase in interest income and reduced losses on non-marketable investments.  These gains were partially offset by increased losses on marketable securities and increased losses from our foreign currency hedging program.Other income (expense), net, decreased $350 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by increased losses on marketable securities and increased losses from our foreign currency hedging program, partially offset by an increase in interest income.The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange rates.We expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount for the remainder of 2016 and future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics.

Consolidated Provision for Income Taxes
The following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions) and effective tax rate for the periods presented:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2016 2015 2016 (unaudited)Provision for income taxes$1,025 $1,242 $2,114 $2,164Effective tax rate20.7% 20.3% 22.1% 19.2%
Our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, partially offset by change in the full year forecast reflecting proportionately more earnings realized in countries with higher statutory tax rates and other items. Our provision for income taxes increased from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in taxable income year over year.Our effective tax rate decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, partially offset by other items. Our provision for income taxes increased from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in taxable income year over year.Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, tax effects related to stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, we had $78.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.As of June 30, 2016, $47.8 billion of the $78.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2016, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.5% that matures at various dates through September 2016. In conjunction with this program, we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of June 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. In May 2011, Google issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (collectively, the "2011 Notes") in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2011 Notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In February 2014, Google issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the "2014 Notes") due in 2024, which was used to repay $1.0 billion of the first tranche of our 2011 Notes that matured in May 2014 and for general corporate purposes.  In May 2016, we paid off our $1.0 billion of the 2011 Notes upon maturity. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding notes had a total carrying value of $2.0 billion and a total estimated fair value of $2.2 billion. In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024. An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of the Alphabet Notes.In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance was $220 million and we intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in the second half of 2016.In October 2015, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. In January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares. The repurchases were executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 5.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $3.7 billion. As of June 30, 2016, we completed all authorized share repurchases under our repurchase program.For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):

Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2016 (unaudited)Net cash provided by operating activities$13,818 $16,778Net cash used in investing activities(12,407) (13,418)Net cash used in financing activities(1,057) (6,351)
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by our operations is advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members' websites. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and digital content, hardware products, licensing arrangements, and service fees received for cloud and apps and our Maps API. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for non cash adjustments, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment,  purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets.Cash used in investing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. This was primarily due to increases in purchases of marketable securities partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities and decreases in purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities.Cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily driven by repurchases of capital stock, increases in repayments of debt, and an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities.

Contractual Obligations
We had long-term taxes payable of $4.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.Please see Note 1 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, please see Part I, Item 7, "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2016. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2016.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar. Our most significant currency exposures are the Euro, British Pound, and Japanese yen. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. We use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.  The fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values. Changes in the time value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currency options could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in AOCI before tax effect would have been approximately $208 million lower as of June 30, 2016, and the total amount of expense recorded as other income (expense), net, would have been approximately $112 million higher as of June 30, 2016. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI before tax effect would have been approximately $1.7 billion higher as of June 30, 2016, and the total amount of expense recorded as other income (expense), net, would have been approximately $157 million higher as of June 30, 2016. The impact in AOCI would offset our hedged foreign currency denominated revenues as they occur.In addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $115 million as of June 30, 2016. The adverse impact as of June 30, 2016 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $1.1 billion from foreign exchange contracts in place for the month of June 30, 2016. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.
Interest Rate Risk
Our investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in U.S. government and its agency securities, money market and other funds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, municipal securities, time deposits, and asset backed securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold.  We use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge realized gains and losses on our securities. These derivative contracts are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. We considered the historical volatility of interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities and interest rate derivative contracts of approximately $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2016.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

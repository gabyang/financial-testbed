(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
(unaudited)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended November 22, 2020, Costco operated 803 warehouses worldwide: 558 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 102 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2021 is a 52-week year ending on August 29, 2021. References to the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 22, 2020, and November 24, 2019, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel
On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $998 using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. As of November 22, 2020, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete, pending determination of the final purchase price, working capital adjustments, the fair value of operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase price of $998 was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $283 and liabilities assumed of $219, based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $934 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. There were no changes to goodwill during the first quarter of 2021. The changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were not material. As additional information becomes available, the provisional fair value estimates will be refined.

Note 8—Taxes
The Company's reported effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 26.3%, excluding the impact of discrete net tax benefits. The provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, including $75 related to the excess tax benefit on stock compensation and $70 related to the special cash dividend payable to employees, who through the Costco 401(k) plan owned approximately 27,000,000 shares of Costco common stock through an employee stock ownership plan. Dividends on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.

Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. The possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.The Company is a defendant in an action under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 5:13-CV-03598; N.D. Cal.; filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action has been remanded to state court.

In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina and a third-party payor in Ohio, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 41 states and American Samoa. In 2019, similar actions were commenced against the Company in state court in Utah. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters.The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the court dismissed with prejudice on August 19, 2020.

Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees.

The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future and may relate to such matters as net sales growth, changes in comparable sales, cannibalization of existing locations by new openings, price or fee changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, capital spending, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction, expense controls, membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation, and the demand for our products and services. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions, including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, uncertainties in the financial markets, consumer and small-business spending patterns and debt levels, breaches of security or privacy of member or business information, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, capital spending, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (generally including health-care costs), energy and certain commodities, geopolitical conditions (including tariffs), the ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, COVID-19 related factors and challenges, including among others, the duration of the pandemic, the unknown long-term economic impacts, reduced member shopping due to illness, travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from discretionary or higher-priced products, reduced workforce due to illness, quarantine, or government mandates, temporary store closures due to reduced workforces or government mandates, supply-chain disruptions, or capacity constraints of third-party logistics suppliers and other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.This management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC.

OVERVIEW
We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers.We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business.The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business.In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 22, 2020, and November 24, 2019, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.Highlights for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 include:•Net sales increased 17% to $42,347, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 15% and sales at 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2020;•Membership fee revenue increased 7% to $861, primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and online and upgrades to Executive Membership; •Gross margin percentage increased 50 basis points, driven by certain core merchandise categories, partially offset by certain ancillary and other businesses;•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 15 basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales, partially offset by incremental wages as a result of COVID-19;•On October 14, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, which was paid on November 13, 2020;•On November 16, 2020, our Board declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, which was paid on December 11, 2020;•The provision for income taxes was impacted by: a benefit related to stock compensation of $75, or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $77, or $0.17 in the first quarter of 2020; and a benefit of $70, or $0.16 per diluted share, in connection with the portion of the special dividend payable to our 401(k) participants; and•Net income was $1,166, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared to $844, or $1.90 per diluted share in 2020.

COVID-19
As the COVID-19 pandemic persists and, in many areas, confirmed cases rise, we have operated as an essential business. We remain focused on our strategy while prioritizing the health and safety of our members and employees. We have taken a variety of measures, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors of our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and their implications on our results of operations have impacted us across all reportable segments to varying degrees. We have recorded strong sales increases in our fresh foods and foods and sundries merchandise categories. This growth has led to improved gross margin and SG&A percentages, as we leveraged these sales to achieve greater efficiency. Our e-commerce business has also benefited, as more members have shopped online. Conversely, we have experienced decreases in both the sales and profitability in certain of our ancillary and other businesses. Additionally, we paid $212 in incremental wages during the first quarter of 2021 related to COVID-19.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $6,111 or 17% during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 15% in the first quarter of 2021, and sales at the 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced strong results in our core merchandise categories, primarily fresh foods and foods and sundries, as well as in our e-commerce business as a result of COVID-19. Sales in certain ancillary and other businesses weakened compared to the first quarter of 2020, largely driven by price deflation and lower volume in our gasoline business, and minimal demand in our travel business.Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $727, or 201 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 19% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 10%, negatively impacting net sales by $399, or 110 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $105, or 29 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.

Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 15% in the first quarter of 2021, and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket and shopping frequency. There was an increase of 86% in e-commerce comparable sales in the first quarter of 2021.

Membership Fees

Membership fees increased 7% in the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to signups at existing and new warehouses and online and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

Gross Margin
12 Weeks EndedNovember 22,2020November 24,2019Net sales$42,347 $36,236 Less merchandise costs37,458 32,233 Gross margin$4,889 $4,003 Gross margin percentage11.55 %11.05 %
The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 65 basis points. This increase was across all categories, but most significantly in fresh foods, where gross margins increased primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Total gross margin percentage increased 50 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.35%, an increase of 30 basis points. This was primarily due to a 66 basis point increase in core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and foods and sundries. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses decreased 20 basis points, as certain of these businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of 12 basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of four basis points. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales, performed similarly to the consolidated results above other than the warehouse ancillary and other businesses in our Canada and Other International segments, which increased overall due to their gasoline and e-commerce operations.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation, was 9.98%, a decrease of 32 basis points compared to the prior year. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 62 basis points, largely attributable to payroll and benefits, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by four basis points and central operating costs were lower by three basis points. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by 37 basis points due to incremental wages as a result of COVID-19.

Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect to open 12 to 14 warehouses.

Interest income decreased in the first quarter 2021 due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts.

The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $135. This was primarily attributable to $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and $70 related to the special cash dividend payable to employees, who through our 401(k) plan owned shares of Costco common stock through an employee stock ownership plan. Employees owned approximately 27,000,000 shares of Costco stock through our 401(k) plan. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.3% for the first quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by $77 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $14,423 and $13,305 at November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,048 and $1,636 at November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,647 in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $2,102 in the first quarter of 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $682 in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $630 in the first quarter of 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first quarter of 2021, we spent $893 on capital expenditures. While the impacts of COVID-19 have delayed certain construction projects, it is our current intention to spend between $3,000 and $3,200 during fiscal 2021. We opened 10 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first quarter of 2021 and plan to open 12 to 14 additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $700 in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $836 in the first quarter of 2020. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to withholding taxes on stock-based awards, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of common stock.
Stock Repurchase Programs
During the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 213,000 and 100,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $359.45 and $295.97, respectively, totaling approximately $77 and $30, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.
Dividends
On October 14, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share payable to shareholders of record on October 30, 2020, which was paid on November 13, 2020. On November 16, 2020, the Board declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, which was paid on December 11, 2020. The special dividend was approximately $4,430 and was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at November 22, 2020.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 22, 2020, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,002. Our international operations maintain $526 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $207 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2021 or at the end of 2020. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $212. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2021 totaled $177, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.
Contractual Obligations
As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020.

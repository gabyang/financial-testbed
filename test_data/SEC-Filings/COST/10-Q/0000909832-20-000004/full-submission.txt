NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
(unaudited)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 16, 2020, Costco operated 785 warehouses worldwide: 546 in the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 11 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material intercompany transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2020 is a 52-week year ending on August 30, 2020. References to the second quarter of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2020, and February 17, 2019, respectively. References to the first half of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2020, and February 17, 2019, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Table of Contents

Leases
The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer.Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. As the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective transition method and elected to use the effective date of September 2, 2019, as the date of initial application. Consequently, the comparative periods presented continue to be in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, previously in effect.The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward conclusions related to: (a) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases; (b) lease classification; and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company has elected not to record operating lease right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of 12 months or less. Lastly, the Company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non-lease components with related lease components when evaluating accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets.


Adoption of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of $2,632 related to recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations as of September 2, 2019. Other line item impacts in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet were not material. The standard did not materially impact the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For more information on the Company's lease arrangements refer to Note 5.

Note 8—Taxes
Other Taxes
The Company is undergoing multiple examinations for value-added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. In September 2019, the Company received an assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded the charge in fiscal 2019 and is protesting the assessment. No adjustments have been made to this estimate in the first half of 2020. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.

The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16. On November 26, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint within 90 days.  Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class actions. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed.In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019, and Note 1 above. Intersegment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

OVERVIEW
We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers.We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods– consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business.The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and less or no direct membership warehouse competition.In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2020, and February 17, 2019, respectively. References to the first half of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2020, and February 17, 2019, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.Highlights for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2019 include:•Net sales increased 10% to $38,256, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 9% and sales at 16 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2019;•Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $816, primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses; •Gross margin percentage decreased 31 basis points, primarily in our core merchandise categories driven by a shift in sales penetration to certain lower-margin warehouse ancillary and other businesses;•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 22 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and a shift in sales penetration to certain warehouse ancillary and other businesses with lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales;•Net income increased 5% to $931, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $889, or $2.01 per diluted share in 2019; and•On January 23, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share, which was paid on February 21, 2020.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $3,628 or 10%, and $5,553 or 8% during the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared to the second quarter and first half of 2019. These increases were attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 9% and 7% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and sales at the 16 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $320, or 92 basis points, due to a 9% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also positively impacted net sales by approximately $85, or 25 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2019, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.During the first half of 2020, changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $198, or 29 basis points, due to a 3% increase in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 19, or three basis points, compared to the first half of 2019, attributable to our Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 9% and 7% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. Comparable sales were also positively impacted by the shift in timing of the Thanksgiving holiday to the second quarter of 2020. Comparable sales for the second quarter and first half of 2020 were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).

Gross Margin

Quarterly Results
The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 15 basis points primarily in fresh foods and hardlines. The decrease in fresh foods was driven primarily by initial operating losses from our new poultry processing plant while hardlines decreased primarily due to timing of the Thanksgiving holiday, which shifted lower-margin activity into the current quarter as compared to the prior year second quarter. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in softlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Total gross margin percentage decreased 31 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.07%, a decrease of 22 basis points. This was primarily due to a shift in sales penetration to certain lower-margin warehouse ancillary businesses, and losses from our poultry processing plant discussed above.Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. and Canadian operations, primarily due to decreases in our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations increased, primarily in our core merchandise categories.

Year-to-date Results
The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased six basis points. This was attributable to a decrease in fresh foods, which was driven primarily by initial operating losses from our new poultry processing plant, partially offset by an increase in softlines.Total gross margin percentage decreased one basis-point compared to the first half of 2019. Excluding the impacts of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.04%, an increase of two basis points from the first half of 2019. This was primarily due to a nine basis-point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, as well as a six basis-point increase related to an adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program. These increases were partially offset by a 14 basis-point decrease in our core merchandise categories, primarily due to losses from our poultry processing plant discussed above.The segment gross margin percentage decreased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to core merchandise categories, partially offset by our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, as well as the breakage adjustment noted above. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations increased due to increases in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses partially offset by decreases in certain of our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations increased, primarily in our core merchandise categories.

Quarterly Results
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 22 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.87%, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to the prior year. Costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, decreased 10 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and a shift in sales penetration to certain warehouse ancillary and other businesses with lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was partially offset by the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for U.S. and Canadian hourly employees effective in March 2019. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points.
Year-to-date Results
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points compared to the first half of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was flat despite the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for U.S. and Canadian hourly employees discussed above. Costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, were lower by two basis points, predominantly in our U.S. operations, due to leveraging increased sales. This decrease was offset by higher central operating costs of two basis points related to maintaining, upgrading and expanding our technology capabilities.

Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2020, we expect to open 15 warehouses, including two relocations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019Net cash provided by operating activities$2,721 $1,958Net cash used in investing activities(1,100) (1,171)Net cash used in financing activities(2,228) (749)
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $8,715 and $9,444 at February 16, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,385 and $1,434 at February 16, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by foreign-exchange rate changes of $9 and negatively impacted by $13 in the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively.Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,721 in the first half of 2020, compared to $1,958 in the first half of 2019. Cash provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,100 in the first half of 2020, compared to $1,171 in the first half of 2019, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.

Capital Expenditure Plans
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2020, we spent $1,260 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,000 during fiscal 2020. We opened four new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first half of 2020 and plan to open 15 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2020. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,228 in the first half of 2020, compared to $749 in the first half of 2019. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the $1,200 repayment of our 1.70% Senior Notes, payment of dividends, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. Dividends totaling $573 were paid during the first half of 2020, of which $286 related to the dividend declared in August 2019. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on February 18, 2020, the Company paid the outstanding principal balance of $500 and associated interest on the 1.75% Senior Notes using cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Stock Repurchase Programs
During the first half of 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 262,000 and 711,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $299.40 and $213.08, respectively, totaling approximately $79 and $151, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.
Dividends
On January 23, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 7, 2020. The dividend was paid subsequent to the end of the quarter on February 21, 2020.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 16, 2020, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $875, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2020. Our international operations maintain $362 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $146 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2020 or at the end of 2019.The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $225. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2020 totaled $150, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.

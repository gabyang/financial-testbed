Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 14, 2021, Costco operated 803 warehouses worldwide: 558 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 102 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2021 is a 52-week year ending on August 29, 2021. References to the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. References to the first half of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel

coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel
On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $998, using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
At February 14, 2021, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete, pending determination of the final purchase price, working capital adjustments, the fair value of operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase price of $998 was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $286 and liabilities assumed of $237, based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $949 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. The changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were not material. The provisional period ends and the final accounting will be complete in the third quarter of 2021.

Note 3—Investments
The Company's investments were as follows:

At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first half of 2021 or 2020.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets.

The fair value of Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japan subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $7,895 and $7,987 at February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.

Note 6—Equity
Dividends
The Company’s current quarterly dividend is $0.70 per share, compared to $0.65 in the second quarter of 2020. On January 21, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.70 per share, which was paid on February 19, 2021. On December 11, 2020, an aggregate payment of approximately $4,430 was made in connection with the special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, declared on November 16, 2020.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Stock repurchase activity during the second quarter and first half of 2021 and 2020 is summarized below:
Shares Repurchased (000s)Average Price per ShareTotal CostSecond quarter of 2021308 $362.95 $112 First half of 2021521 $361.52 $189 Second quarter of 2020162 $301.50 $49 First half of 2020262 $299.40 $79
These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under the approved plan was $3,556 at February 14, 2021. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation
The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.As required by the Company's Seventh Restated 2002 Incentive Plan and 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2021 special cash dividend the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.019 (rounded up to a whole share), representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $391.77 on November 30, 2020, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $384.50 on the ex-dividend date, December 1, 2020. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 94,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the Seventh Restated 2002 Incentive Plan and the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under each plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 222,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At February 14, 2021, 11,946,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding:•4,285,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods;•29,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and•102,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2021, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are included in the table below. The Company recognized compensation expense for these awards in the second quarter of 2021, as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved.
The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first half of 2021:

Note 8—Taxes
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. The possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or

Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class action. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v.

Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

OVERVIEW
We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers.We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business.The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business.In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. References to the first half of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.Highlights for the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 include:•Net sales increased 15% to $43,888, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 13% and sales at 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2020;•Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $881, driven by signups at warehouses and online and by upgrades to Executive Membership; •Gross margin percentage decreased two basis points, driven by certain ancillary and other businesses and incremental wages due to COVID-19, partially offset by increases in our core merchandise categories;•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 11 basis points, primarily due to incremental wages as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by leveraging increased sales;•On January 21, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, which was paid on February 19, 2021. The special cash dividend of $10.00 per share declared on November 16, 2020, was paid on December 11, 2020; and•Net income was $951, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared to $931, or $2.10 per diluted share in 2020.

COVID-19
As the COVID-19 pandemic persists we continue to operate as an essential business. We remain focused on our strategy while prioritizing the health and safety of our members and employees. We have taken a variety of measures, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors of our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have impacted us across all reportable segments to varying degrees. We have recorded strong sales and profitability in our fresh foods, foods and sundries, and our e-commerce business. Conversely, we have experienced decreases in sales and profitability in certain of our ancillary and other businesses, primarily in our gasoline and travel businesses. COVID-related supply constraints have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future.We paid $246 and $458 in incremental wages during the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, related to COVID-19. The incremental wage and benefit costs associated with COVID-19, which began on March 1, 2020 and ended on February 28, 2021, totaled approximately $825. Effective March 1, 2021, we implemented permanent wage increases for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these permanent wage increases is approximately $400. Additionally, in certain areas where we do business in the United States, governments have mandated, or are considering mandating extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees, which will result in higher costs.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $5,632 or 15%, and $11,743 or 16% during the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 13% and 14% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, and sales at the 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2020. During the second quarter and first half of 2021, we experienced increased sales in our core merchandise categories, both in our warehouses and online due in part to COVID-19. Sales in certain ancillary and other businesses weakened compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020, largely driven by our gasoline and travel businesses.During the second quarter of 2021, changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $367, or 96 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 10% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 9%, negatively impacting net sales by $341, or 89 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $423, or 110 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.During the first half of 2021, changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $1,094, or 147 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 15% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 9%, negatively impacting net sales by $740, or 99 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $527, or 71 basis points, compared to the first half of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 13% and 14% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket and shopping frequency. There was an increase of 76% and 80% in e-commerce comparable sales in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively.

Membership fees increased 8% in both the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by signups at warehouses and online and by upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada. If this standardization would have been done at the end of the second quarter of 2020, it would have resulted in an addition to the count of approximately 2.2 million total cardholders, of which 1.4 million were paid members. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected.

Quarterly Results
The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 71 basis points. This increase was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods, primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.87%, a decrease of 11 basis points. This was primarily due to a 55 basis point decrease in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19, predominantly in our gasoline and travel businesses. The decreases in warehouse ancillary and other business were partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of 14 basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of five basis points. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 63 basis points in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods.Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), performed similarly to the consolidated results above for our U.S. segment. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our Canadian and Other International segments, primarily due to increases in fresh foods and foods and sundries partially offset by incremental wages related to COVID-19 and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program.
Year-to-date Results
The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased 72 basis points. This increase was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods where gross margins increased primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. Total gross margin percentage increased 24 basis points compared to the first half of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.11%, an increase of ten basis points. This was primarily due to an increase of 68 basis points in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and foods and sundries. These increases were partially offset by a 41 basis point decrease in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19, predominantly our gasoline and travel businesses. The decreases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses were partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of 13 basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of four basis points. The segment gross margin percentage decreased in our U.S. segment primarily due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses and incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by increases in our core merchandise categories. Our Canada and Other International segments increased primarily due to certain of our core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. These increases were partially offset by the incremental wages and increased spending by executive members discussed above.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 9.81%, an increase of three basis points compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by 42 basis points due to incremental wages as a result of COVID-19. Central operating costs were also higher by two basis points, largely in our U.S. segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 38 basis points due to warehouse operations and other businesses, largely attributable to payroll and benefits, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points.

Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect to open 13 warehouses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
24 Weeks EndedFebruary 14,2021February 16,2020Net cash provided by operating activities$2,685 $2,721 Net cash used in investing activities(1,037)(1,100)Net cash used in financing activities(5,350)(2,228)
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $9,254 and $13,305 at February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,659 and $1,636 at February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,685 in the first half of 2021, compared to $2,721 in the first half of 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the strategic forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,037 in the first half of 2021, compared to $1,100 in the first half of 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2021, we spent $1,466 on capital expenditures. While COVID-19 has delayed certain construction projects, it is our current intention to spend between $3,000 and $3,200 during fiscal 2021. We opened 10 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first half of 2021 and plan to open 13 additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $5,350 in the first half of 2021, compared to $2,228 in the first half of 2020. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock.

Dividends
On January 21, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 5, 2021, which was paid on February 19, 2021. On December 11, 2020, an aggregate payment of approximately $4,430 was made in connection with the special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, declared on November 16, 2020.
Stock Repurchase Program
During the first half of 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 521,000 and 262,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $361.52 and $299.40, respectively, totaling approximately $189 and $79, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 14, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,051. Our international operations maintain $575 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $207 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2021 or at the end of 2020. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $215. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2021 totaled $181, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.
Contractual Obligations
As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments.

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At November 24, 2024, Costco operated 896 warehouses worldwide: 616 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia,14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025 is a 52-week year ending on August 31, 2025. References to the first quarter of 2025 and 2024 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 24, 2024, and November 26, 2023.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect; the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to conform with current year presentation.

Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in many claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be actual losses in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to one matter described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but monitors for developments that make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.In November 2023, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay minimum wage, failure to pay overtime, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to provide accurate wage statements, failure to reimburse expenses, failure to pay wages when due, and failure to pay sick pay. Martin Reyes v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Sacramento County Superior Court (No. 23cv011351), removed to federal court, No. 2:24-cv-00300 (E.D. Cal.). A second amended complaint was filed, which the Company has moved to dismiss. In January 2024, the same plaintiff filed a related Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) representative action, seeking civil penalties and asserting the same alleged underlying Labor Code violations and an additional suitable seating claim. In May 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended PAGA complaint; the Company has denied the material allegations of the complaint and filed a motion to stay the action.In August 2024, an employee filed an action under PAGA against the Company, alleging claims for penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code regarding: off-the-clock work, incorrect and untimely payment of wages. Nader v. Costco (No. CV-24-006198; Stanislaus County Superior Court). An amended complaint was filed in November 2024, as to which the Company has yet to respond.

Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. Claims against the Company in federal court in Georgia and Florida have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters.Between September 25 and October 31, 2023, five class action suits were filed against the Company alleging privacy law violations stemming from pixel trackers on Costco.com: Birdwell v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. T23-1405, Contra Costa County Superior Court; and Scott v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-08808 (C.D. Cal.), now consolidated with R.S. v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-01628 (W.D. Wash.); Groves, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-01662 (W.D. Wash.), and Castillo v. Costco Wholesale Corp., under No. 2:34-cv-01548 (W.D. Wash.). The Castillo plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on January 26, 2024, which seeks damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees under various statutes, including the Washington Consumer Protection Act, Washington Privacy Act, Washington Uniform Health Care Information Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, and California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. The consolidated complaint also alleges breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, conversion, and unjust enrichment. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Castillo complaint on March 11, 2024. In November 2024 the court denied the motion to dismiss in substantial part. On May 16, 2024, the parties stipulated to stay Birdwell pending resolution of Castillo. On January 2, and August 22, 2024, the Company received related civil investigative demands from the Washington Attorney General's Office. On January 3, 2024, the Company received a related pre-litigation letter from the Los Angeles Office of the County Counsel. The Company is in the process of responding to both agencies.On June 20, 2024, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Company and Nice-Pak Products, Inc., alleging that Kirkland Signature Fragrance Free Baby Wipes contain 3.7 parts per billion of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The complaint alleges that the label claim that the wipes are "made with naturally derived ingredients" thus violates various state consumer protection and false advertising laws. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages, as well as equitable relief and attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 9, 2024. Bullard, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et ano., No. 3:24-cv-03714 (N.D. Cal.).The Company has been served in over seventy product liability cases in California and Oregon related to its alleged sale of artificial and natural stone countertops. These lawsuits allege strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, fraud, and failure to warn claims on the grounds that the fabricators and cutters of the stone slabs used to fabricate countertops offered for sale by Costco are exposed to silica particulates in the air while performing such work, allegedly causing lung diseases, including, but not limited to, silicosis. The defendants in these cases include the manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. The Company has denied all claims, has filed cross-claims pertaining to indemnity and contribution, and otherwise sought indemnity from responsible parties.In January 2023 the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Washington, requesting documents. The government is conducting a False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company presented or caused to be presented to the federal government for payment false claims relating to prescription medications.

OVERVIEW
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 9, 2024.We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce sites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other). E-commerce and business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations) and inflation or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our selling general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our net sales and gross margin are influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage) in the near term. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, has a lower gross-margin percentage than our warehouse operations.We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses; it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and lower SG&A expense relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. Negative aspects of such growth include lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in many of our foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. The membership format is an integral part of our business and profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate may be adversely impacted by memberships in newer international markets and a higher penetration of memberships sold online, both of which typically renew at a lower rate.Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon. Results expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarter of 2025 and 2024 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 24, 2024, and November 26, 2023. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding.Highlights for the first quarter of 2025 versus 2024 include:•Net sales increased 8% to $60,985, driven by an increase in comparable sales and sales at 26 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2024;•Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $1,166, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership;•Gross margin percentage increased 24 basis points; seven basis points excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales;•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points and was flat excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation;•The provision for income taxes was positively impacted by a benefit related to stock compensation of $100, $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $44, $0.10 per diluted share, in 2024;•Net income was $1,798, $4.04 per diluted share, compared to $1,589, $3.58 per diluted share in 2024; and•A quarterly cash dividend of $1.16 per share was declared on October 16, 2024, and paid on November 15, 2024.

_______________
(1) Comparable sales for the first quarter of 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $4,268 or 8% during the first quarter of 2025. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at the 26 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2024. Sales increased $4,333 or 10% in core merchandise categories during the first quarter of 2025. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses decreased less than 1% during the first quarter of 2025, due to lower gasoline prices, partially offset by pharmacy and all other warehouse ancillary businesses. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $908, 160 basis points, compared to 2024, with a 12% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $164, 29 basis points, attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% in the first quarter of 2025 and were positively impacted by increased shopping frequency and a slightly higher average ticket.

Membership fee revenue increased 8% in the first quarter of 2025, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, our renewal rates were 92.8% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date.As previously reported, we increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 1, 2024. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Due to this deferral, the increases had an immaterial impact in the first quarter of 2025.

Quarterly Results
Gross margin percentage increased 24 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.11%, an increase of seven basis points. This increase was positively impacted by: 17 basis points in our core merchandise categories, primarily due to sales mix and our co-branded credit card program, and six basis points related to 2% rewards. This increase was partially offset by 16 basis points due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce.The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased three basis points. The increase was primarily due to fresh foods, partially offset by non-foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margin from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Gross margin percentage on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in all segments. Our U.S. segment performed similarly to the consolidated results above. Our Canadian and Other International segment's gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to increases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increased 2% rewards.

Quarterly Results
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation that measure was flat. The comparison to last year was favorably impacted by four basis points due to lower preopening costs and three basis points due to stock compensation expense. SG&A was negatively impacted by four basis points due to warehouse operations and other businesses, which included the impact of the wage increase in July 2024, partially offset by sales leverage and improved productivity. Central operating costs were also higher by three basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were lower in our U.S. segment and higher in our Canadian and Other International segments.

The decrease in interest income in the first quarter was due to lower average cash and investment balances, following the special dividend in January 2024, and lower interest rates. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net, include mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts and revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
12 Weeks EndedNovember 24,2024November 26,2023Net cash provided by operating activities$3,260 $4,651 Net cash used in investing activities(985)(366)Net cash used in financing activities(1,193)(974)
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,827 and $11,144 at November 24, 2024, and September 1, 2024. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,789 and $2,519 at November 24, 2024, and September 1, 2024. These receivables generally settle within four days.Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land-purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.We believe that our cash and investment position and operating cash flow, with capacity under existing and available credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future and our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,260 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $4,651 in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including wages and employee benefits, utilities, credit and debit card processing fees, and operating leases. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory levels and turnover, payment terms with suppliers, early payments to obtain discounts, and the shift in timing of the seasonal holiday to the second quarter of 2025.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $985 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $366 in the first quarter of 2024, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses, information systems and manufacturing and distribution facilities. In the first quarter of 2025, we spent $1,264 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend a total of approximately $5,000 during fiscal 2025. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened seven new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first quarter of 2025 and plan to open 22 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2025. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,193 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $974 in the first quarter of 2024. Cash flow used in financing activities during the first quarter of 2025 was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, repurchases of common stock, and repayments of short-term borrowings. Cash flow provided by financing activities included proceeds from short-term borrowings.
Dividends
A quarterly cash dividend of $1.16 per share was declared on October 16, 2024, and paid on November 15, 2024.
Share Repurchase Program
On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 230,000 and 288,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $899.23 and $564.06, totaling approximately $206 and $162. These amounts may differ from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,659 at the end of the first quarter.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 24, 2024, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,184. Our international operations maintain $689 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $159 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of the first quarter of 2025 and at the end of fiscal 2024.We have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $222. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2025 totaled $202, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in that Report.

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 13, 2022, Costco operated 828 warehouses worldwide: 572 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 30 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2022 is a 52-week year ending on August 28, 2022. References to the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 13, 2022 and February 14, 2021, respectively. References to the first half of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 13, 2022 and February 14, 2021, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The workplace temperature claims continue in litigation.In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco

Table of Contents
Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand was appealed; the appeal is in abeyance due to a pending settlement for an immaterial amount that was agreed upon in February 2021. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement in October 2021, and the Court's final review is scheduled for May 2022.In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In September 2021 the court granted Costco’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied class certification. In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The case was stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy, and his individual claim was settled for an immaterial amount. A request for dismissal of the class and representative action is pending. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company answered the complaint on October 21, 2021, denying the material allegations.In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend.

Note 9—Segment Reporting
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the segments inclusive of this expense. Operating income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change.

OVERVIEW
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Merchandise costs in the second quarter and first half of 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction require maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 13, 2022, and February 14, 2021. References to the first half of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 13, 2022, and February 14, 2021. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.Highlights for the second quarter of 2022 versus 2021 include:•Net sales increased 16% to $50,937, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 14% and sales at 25 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2021;•Membership fee revenue increased 10% to $967, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and an increase in our renewal rate;•Gross margin percentage decreased 32 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories, partially offset by our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline;•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 94 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19;•Net income was $1,299, $2.92 per diluted share, compared to $951, $2.14 per diluted share in 2021;•On January 20, 2022 our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share, which was paid on February 18, 2022; and •Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in mid-March we will be increasing various wages and benefits, consistent with the three-year cycle on which this has been done historically. Most significant are increases of a minimum of fifty cents per hour for U.S. and Canada wage scales. Certain other bonuses and benefits will be increasing for many employees. The estimated incremental annualized pre-tax costs of these increases, after considering our normal annual increases is approximately $275. Further, an additional $85 will be recorded in the third fiscal quarter related to a one-time true-up to accrued benefits, related to these wage and benefit changes.

COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business in the second quarter of 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. COVID-related and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2021, we paid $246 and $458 in incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $7,049 or 16%, and $14,119 or 16% during the second quarter and first half of 2022. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14% and 15% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, and sales at the 25 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2021. While sales in all core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased, the rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. Sales continued to be impacted by inflation, higher than what we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.During the second quarter of 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $1,713, or 390 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 44% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 25%, positively impacting net sales by $814, or 185 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $281, or 64 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations.During the first half of 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $3,559, or 413 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 46% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 26%, positively impacting net sales by $1,620, or 188 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $101, or 12 basis points, compared to the first half of 2021, primarily attributable to our Canadian operations, partially offset by our Other International operations.

Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 14% and 15% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and the average ticket, which includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. E-commerce comparable sales increased 13% in the second quarter and first half of 2022.

Membership fee revenues increased 10% in both the second quarter and first half of 2022, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, our member renewal rates were 92% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing, and increased penetration of executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

Quarterly Results
The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 28 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Total gross margin percentage decreased 32 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.01%, an increase of five basis points. This was primarily due to a 49 basis-point increase in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 14 basis points due to decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ended February 28, 2021. Gross margin was negatively impacted due to a 43 basis-point decrease in all core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and foods and sundries, 14 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs, and one basis-point due to increased 2% rewards. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $31, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. and Canadian segment, due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by core merchandise categories. Our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted due to the LIFO charge. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19.
Year-to-date Results
The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 23 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to fresh foods, and foods and sundries, partially offset by non-foods.Total gross margin percentage decreased 40 basis points compared to the first half of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was flat as compared to the first half of 2021. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, increased 31 basis points. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 13 basis points due to ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Gross margin was negatively impacted due to a 34 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly foods and sundries, and fresh foods. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by nine basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs and one basis-point due to increased 2% rewards. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. segment and performed similarly to the quarterly results above. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Canadian segment, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All our segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19.

Quarterly Results
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 94 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation the decrease was 63 basis points. Ceasing incremental COVID-19 wages reduced expenses by 42 basis points. Central operating costs were lower by 10 basis points and warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by nine basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by two basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $23, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations.
Year-to-date Results
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points compared to the first half of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation the decrease was 46 basis points. SG&A expenses were positively impacted by a net 28 basis points due to the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by a write-off of certain information technology assets. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 10 basis points, largely attributable to payroll and benefits, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Central operating costs were lower by eight basis points. Stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. Pre-opening expenses were higher by one basis point.The first half of fiscal 2022 includes the permanent $1 increase for hourly employees in our warehouses and distribution channels that began in March 2021, and beginning in October 2021, the additional starting wage increase from $16 and $16.50 to $17 and $18.

These receivables generally settle within four days.Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations.Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations primarily relate to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Management also believes that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet U.S. liquidity and capital requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,659 in the first half of 2022, compared to $2,685 in the first half of 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,393 in the first half of 2022, compared to $1,037 in the first half of 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2022, we spent $1,778 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $4,000 during fiscal year 2022. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 14 new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first half of 2022 and plan to open 15 to 18 additional new warehouses, including up to three relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2022. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon changes in capital expenditure needs or the economic environment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,667 in the first half of 2022, compared to $5,350 in the first half of 2021. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to repayments of our 2.300% Senior Notes, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of common stock. In the first half of 2021, cash flow used in financing was primarily due to the payment of a special dividend.
Dividends
On January 20, 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 4, 2022, which was paid on February 18, 2022.
Share Repurchase Program
During the first half of 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 236,000 and 521,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $498.00 and $361.52, totaling approximately $118 and $189. These amounts may differ from the repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 13, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,034. Our international operations maintain $550 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $195 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were immaterial at the end of the second quarter of 2022, and at the end of 2021. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $229. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2022 totaled $201, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.

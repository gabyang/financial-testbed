COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollars in millions, except share data)
(unaudited)
Note 1Summary of Significant Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale
Corporation and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will
produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At February 17, 2013, Costco operated 622 warehouses worldwide: 448 United States (U.S.) locations (in 41 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico), 85 Canadian locations, 32 Mexico
locations, 23 United Kingdom (U.K.) locations, 13 Japan locations, 9 Taiwan locations, 9 Korea locations, and 3 Australia locations. The Company also operates online businesses at costco.com in the U.S, costco.ca in Canada, and costco.co.uk in the
U.K. Basis of Presentation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest, consolidated entities in which it has made equity investments,
or has other interests through which it has majority-voting control or it exercises the right to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys performance (Costco or the Company). The Company reports noncontrolling interests
in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Companys equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and other consolidated entities have been eliminated
in consolidation. In July 2012, Costco purchased its former joint venture partners 50% equity interest in Costco Mexico. The Companys net income excludes income attributable to noncontrolling interests in its operations in Mexico prior
to the July 2012 acquisition of the 50% noncontrolling interest, Taiwan, and Korea. After the acquisition date, 100% of Mexicos operations are included in net income attributable to Costco. Unless otherwise noted, references to net
income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore,
the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Companys annual report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2,
2012. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a
52/53-week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarters of 2013 and 2012 relate to the twelve week fiscal quarters ended February 17, 2013, and February 12, 2012,
respectively. References to the first half of 2013 and 2012 relate to the twenty-four weeks ended February 17, 2013, and February 12, 2012, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of con-Note 1Summary of Significant Policies (Continued) 
tingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications
did not have a material impact on the Companys previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable,
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Companys investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring
fair value. The three levels of inputs are:

Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 Level 2:
 
Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The Companys current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. The Companys
long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques
utilized in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities as disclosed in the Companys Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2012. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined
primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory
method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment
each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, when actual inflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. Due to overall deflationary trends in the second quarter and first half of 2013, a benefit of $9 and $11 was recorded to merchandise costs, respectively, to reduce
the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories. Due to overall net inflationary trends, a charge to merchandise costs of $3 was recorded in the second quarter and first half of 2012. At February 17, 2013, and September 2, 2012,
the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories was $97 and $108, respectively. Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. The Company manages these fluctuations, in part, through the
use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, Note 1Summary of Significant Policies (Continued) 
seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to
economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Companys international subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge
accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. The aggregate notional amounts of
open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $275 and $284 at February 17, 2013 and September 2, 2012, respectively. The Company
seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the Company has an established banking relationship. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates
counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts as of February 12, 2013, and September 2, 2012. The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income relating to the net
changes in the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in the second quarter and the first half of 2013 and 2012. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes, particularly electricity and natural gas, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of
its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the
characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark-to-market adjustment. Foreign Currency The Company recognizes foreign-currency
transaction gains and losses related to revaluing all monetary assets and revaluing or settling monetary liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statements of income. Generally, this includes the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses
from all settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items resulted in a net gain of $6 and $15 in the second quarter and first half of 2013, respectively, as compared to a net gain of $3 and $23 in the second quarter and first half of
2012, respectively. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from
common stock and the excess of repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. See Note 5 for additional information. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued guidance that eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other
comprehensive income or to present the information in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of 2013. Note 1Summary of Significant Policies (Continued) In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the rules related to testing goodwill for
impairment. The revised guidance allows an initial qualitative evaluation, based on the entitys events and circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
The results of this qualitative assessment determine whether it is necessary to perform the currently required two-step impairment test. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of 2013. Adoption of this guidance had no impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance to provide enhanced disclosures related to reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. An entity will be required to disclose the net income line items impacted by significant
reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the item is reclassified in its entirety. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is
required to cross-reference other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2012. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2014. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements or
disclosures. Note 2Investments The Companys major categories of investments have not changed from the annual reporting period ended September 2, 2012. The
Companys investments at February 17, 2013, and September 2, 2012, were as follows:

The current portion of long-term debt is included in other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheets. The estimated fair value of the Companys debt was based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. Substantially all of the
Companys long-term debt is classified as Level 2. On December 7, 2012, the Company issued $3,500 in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes as follows: 

 

 
 $1,200 of 0.65% Senior Notes due December 7, 2015. Interest is due semi-annually on June 7 and December 7, with the first payment due on
June 7, 2013; 

 

 
 $1,100 of 1.125% Senior Notes due December 15, 2017. Interest is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15, with the first payment due on
June 15, 2013; and 

 

 
 $1,200 of 1.7% Senior Notes due December 15, 2019. Interest is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15, with the first payment due on
June 15, 2013. Note 5Equity and Comprehensive Income Dividends The Companys current
quarterly dividend rate is $0.275 per share, compared to $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2012. On November 28, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend on Costco common stock of $7.00 per share, which was paid on
December 18, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 10, 2012. The aggregate payment was approximately $3,049. Stock Repurchase Programs There was no stock repurchase
activity in the second quarter of 2013. In the second quarter of 2012, we repurchased 1,759,000 shares, at an average price of $82.20, totaling $145. In the first half of 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 357,000 shares and 3,881,000 shares, at an
average price of $96.41 and $81.84, for a total expenditure of $34 and $318, respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,055 at February 17, 2013. These amounts differ from the
Note 5Equity and Comprehensive Income (Continued) 
stock repurchase balances in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of the quarter. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as
conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Components of Equity and Comprehensive Income The following
tables show the changes in equity attributable to Costco and the noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries and other entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, but not a total ownership interest:

Note 6Stock-Based Compensation Plans In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Fifth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan was amended following shareholder approval and is now referred
to as the Sixth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Sixth Plan). The Sixth Plan initially authorized the issuance of 16,000,000 shares (9,143,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants in addition to shares authorized under the previous plan. Each
RSU issued is counted as 1.75 shares toward the limit of shares available. The Company issues new shares Note 6Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued) 
of common stock upon exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. RSUs are settled in shares and delivered to participants annually, net of shares equal to the minimum statutory withholding
taxes. As required by the Companys Sixth Plan, in conjunction with the special cash dividend discussed in Note 5, adjustments were made to awards
outstanding on the dividend record date to preserve their value following the special cash dividend, as follows: (i) the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased; and (ii) the exercise prices of outstanding stock options
were reduced and the number of shares subject to such options was increased. The number of outstanding stock options and RSUs was increased by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.0763, representing the ratio of the NASDAQ
closing price of $105.95 on December 5, 2012, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the NASDAQ opening price of $98.44 on the ex-dividend date, December 6, 2012. The exercise prices of stock options
were reduced by multiplying the prices by a factor of 0.9291, representing the ratio of the NASDAQ opening price on the ex-dividend date to the NASDAQ closing price on December 5. Approximately 2,905,000 stock options were adjusted, and
approximately 9,676,000 RSUs were adjusted. These adjustments did not result in additional share-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the outstanding awards immediately following the payment of the special cash dividend was equal to the
fair value immediately prior to such distribution. As further required by the Sixth Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the Sixth Plan was proportionally adjusted based on the 1.0763 ratio described above. This resulted in an
additional 778,000 shares available to be granted. Summary of Stock Option Activity All outstanding stock options were fully vested and exercisable as of February 17, 2013 and September 2, 2012. The following table summarizes stock option transactions during the first half of 2013:


 
 9,539,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; 

 

 
 408,000 performance-based RSUs granted to certain executive officers of the Company for which the performance targets have been met. Further restrictions lapse

Note 7Income Taxes The Companys reported effective income tax rates for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended February 17, 2013, were 25.1% and 29.6%,
respectively, compared to 34.2% and 37.3% for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended February 12, 2012, respectively, in the accompanying condensed con-Note 7Income Taxes (Continued) 
solidated statements of income, which includes the net impact of discrete tax items. The Companys current year effective tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits of $72,
primarily due to a $62 tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend of $7 per share paid by the Company to employees, who through the Companys 401(k) Retirement Plan, owned 22,600,000 shares of Company stock, through an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan. Dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The Companys effective tax rate for the first
half of 2012 was adversely impacted by a net discrete expense of $26 relating primarily to the adverse impact of an audit of Costco Mexico by the Mexican tax authority and the tax effects of nondeductible expenses for the Companys
contributions to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in Washington State. Note 8Net Income Per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the effect on net income and the weighted average number of

Note 9Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved
in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect
the likelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to
monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. As of the date of this report, the Company has not recorded an accrual with respect to any matter described below. In each case, there is
a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. The possible loss or range of loss cannot in our view, however, be reasonably estimated because, among other things, (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified;
(ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. Note 9Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) The Company is a defendant in the following matters, among others: A case brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in
violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California state law. Shirley Rae Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-04-3341-MHP. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages,
punitive damages, injunctive relief, interest and attorneys fees. Class certification was granted by the district court on January 11, 2007. On September 16, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the
order of class certification and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. On September 25, 2012, the district court certified a class of women in the United States denied promotion to warehouse general manager or assistant
general manager since January 3, 2002. Currently the class is believed to be approximately 1,250 people. A trial has been set for January 2014. Numerous putative class actions have been brought around the United States against motor fuel retailers, including the Company, alleging that they have been
overcharging consumers by selling gasoline or diesel that is warmer than 60 degrees without adjusting the volume sold to compensate for heat-related expansion or disclosing the effect of such expansion on the energy equivalent received by the
consumer. The Company is named in the following actions: Raphael Sagalyn, et al., v. Chevron USA, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-430 (D. Md.); Phyllis Lerner, et al., v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, et al., Case No. 07-1216 (C.D. Cal.); Linda

(W.D. Tenn.); Mara Redstone, et al., v. Chevron USA, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-20751 (S.D. Fla.); Fred Aguirre, et al. v. BP West Coast Products LLC, et al., Case No. 07-1534 (N.D. Cal.); J.C. Wash, et al., v. Chevron USA, Inc., et al.;

v. BP Products North America, Inc., et al., Case No. 07cv291 (E.D. Tex.); S. Garrett Cook, Jr., et al., v. Hess Corporation, et al., Case No. 07cv750 (M.D. Ala.); Jeff Jenkins, et al. v. Amoco Oil Company, et al., Case No. 07-cv-00661
(D. Utah); and Mark Wyatt, et al., v. B. P. America Corp., et al., Case No. 07-1754 (S.D. Cal.). On June 18, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assigned the action, entitled In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices
Litigation, MDL Docket No 1840, to Judge Kathryn Vratil in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. On April 12, 2009, the Company agreed to settle the actions in which it is named as a defendant. Under the settlement, the
Company agreed, to the extent allowed by law, to install over five years from the effective date of the settlement temperature-correcting dispensers in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Other than payments to class representatives, the settlement does not provide for cash payments to class members. On September 22, 2011, the court preliminarily approved a revised
settlement, which did not materially alter the terms. On April 24, 2012, the court granted final approval of the revised settlement. A class member who objected has filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement. Plaintiffs
have moved for an award of $10 million in attorneys fees, as well as an award of costs and payments to class representatives. The Company has opposed the motion. On October 4, 2006, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, seeking records relating to the Companys receipt and
handling of hazardous merchandise returned by Costco members and other records. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorneys Office. Note 9Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Information Request to the Company, dated November 1,
2007, regarding warehouses in the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada and relating to compliance with regulations concerning air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. On March 4, 2009, the Company was advised by the Department
of Justice that the Department was prepared to allege that the Company has committed at least nineteen violations of the leak-repair requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 82.156(i) and at least seventy-four violations of the recordkeeping requirements of
40 C.F.R. § 82.166(k), (m) at warehouses in these states. The Company has responded to these allegations, is engaged in communications with the Department about these and additional allegations, and has entered into tolling agreements.
Substantial penalties may be levied for violations of the Clean Air Act. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry. On October 7, 2009, the
District Attorneys for San Diego, San Joaquin and Solano Counties filed a complaint, People of the State of California v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al, No. 37-2009-00099912 (Superior Court for the County of San Diego), alleging on information
and belief that the Company has violated and continues to violate provisions of the California Health and Safety Code and the Business and Professions Code through the use of certain spill clean-up materials at its gasoline stations. Relief sought
includes, among other things, requests for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties, costs and attorneys fees. The Company
has received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records of the Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the
turnover of unclaimed property subject to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. The Company
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of
the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter. Note 10Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the United
Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. The Companys reportable segments are largely based on managements organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of
financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Companys annual report filed on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2012, and Note 1 above. All material inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based
compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Companys Canadian and Other International Operations, but are included in the U.S. Operations because those costs are not allocated internally and generally come under the responsibility of the
Companys U.S. management team.

litigation impact and the demand for our products and services. Forward-looking statements may also be identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate,
intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely
result, and similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions, including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, uncertainties in the financial markets, consumer and small business spending patterns and debt
levels, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care costs), energy and certain commodities, geopolitical conditions, and other
risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements, except
as required by law. This management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal 2012 annual report
on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC.
OVERVIEW
We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories
will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse
facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters. We believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth (we report comparable sales as sales in warehouses open for at least one year,
including relocations, remodels, and expansions). Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts that they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced
by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive
conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of currency fluctuations, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales
and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another
substantial

(Continued)
(dollars in millions, except per share, membership fee data, and warehouse number data)


factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous
and widespread, including a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, and department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. While we cannot
control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix,
including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged, but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our
pricing authority  consistently providing the most competitive values. This may cause us, for example, to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members, negatively
impacting gross margin. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and, to a much lesser extent, relocating existing warehouses to larger
and better-located facilities. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. However, the negative
aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are lessened. Our rate of square footage growth is
higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our financial performance also depends heavily on
our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating
to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction
requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business
is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Part I, Item 1, Note 10 of this Report).
Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less direct membership warehouse competition. Additionally, we operate
our lower-margin gasoline business only in the United States and Canada. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact
of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars
for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is typically calculated as the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year periods currency exchange rates.
Historically (prior to the July 2012 acquisition of the 50% noncontrolling interest), our operations in Mexico were through a 50% owned joint venture
(Mexico). For the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended Februay 12, 2012, the financial position and results of Mexicos operations are fully consolidated

and the joint venture partners share is included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. In July 2012, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in Mexico from our
joint venture partner, and therefore, have included 100% of Mexicos operations within net income attributable to Costco for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended February 17, 2013. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarters of 2013 and 2012 relate to the twelve-week fiscal quarters ended
February 17, 2013, and February 12, 2012, respectively. References to the first half of 2013 and 2012 relate to the twenty-four weeks ended February 17, 2013, and February 12, 2012, respectively. Certain percentages presented are
calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Key items for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter of 2012 include: 

 

 
 Net sales increased 8% to $24,343, driven by a 5% increase in comparable sales and sales at the 24 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter
of fiscal 2012. Net sales were favorably impacted by the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S dollar; 

 

 
 Membership fees increased 15% to $528, primarily due to the impact of raising our annual membership fees, and new membership sign-ups and higher membership
renewal rates at warehouses open for more than one year; 

 

 
 Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points; 

 

 
 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points; 

 

 
 Net income increased 39% to $547, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared to $394, or $0.90 per diluted share. The current quarter results were positively impacted
by a $62 tax benefit, or $0.14 per diluted share, in connection with the special cash dividend paid by the Company in December 2012 to the Company 401(k) Plan participants; 

 

 
 On November 28, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share. On December 18, 2012, approximately $3,049 was paid
in connection with this dividend. Additionally, on December 7, 2012, we issued $3,500 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes; and 

 

 
 On January 24, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.275 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of
the second quarter.

Net Sales Net sales
increased $1,835 or 8%, and $3,858 or 9% in the second quarter and first half of 2013, respectively. These increases were attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and sales at the 24 net new warehouses opened since the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2012. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales during the second quarter and
first half of 2013 by approximately $131, or 58 basis points, and $248, or 57 basis points, respectively. The positive impact in the second quarter and first half of 2013 was primarily due to the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar. Gasoline price
inflation positively impacted net sales by approximately $146, or 33 basis points, during the first half of 2013, due to a 3% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 5% and 6% in the second quarter and first half of 2013,
respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average amount spent by our members. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during the second quarter and first half of 2013 as well as
gasoline price inflation in the first half of 2013 positively impacted comparable sales results. The increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations)
primarily in our Other International segment due to increased warehouse openings in Asia.

Membership fee revenue increased 15% in both the second quarter and first half of 2013. These increases were due to the impact of
raising our annual membership fees, new membership sign-ups and higher membership renewal rates at warehouses open for more than one year, and new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012. For the second quarter of 2013,
our member renewal rates have increased slightly relative to the second quarter of 2012, currently at approximately 89.8% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86.5% on a worldwide basis. As previously reported, we increased our annual membership fee in the U.S. and Canada effective November 1, 2011, for new members, and January 1, 2012, for renewal members. We account for membership fee
revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues of approximately $35 and $65 in the second
quarter and first half of 2013, respectively, and will continue to have a significant impact through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Gross

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. Gross margin in our
core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods) when expressed as a percentage of net sales was unchanged over the prior year. Gross margin for core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percent of core
merchandise (rather than net) sales, increased eight basis points. This was primarily due to increases in hardlines and softlines partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods. The gross margin comparison was positively impacted by five basis points
due to a $9 LIFO benefit in the second quarter 2013 compared to a charge of $3 in the prior year. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership 2% reward program negatively impacted gross margin by one basis point, due to increased spending by
Executive Members. Warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin increased by two basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by $13 in the second quarter of 2013. Gross margin on a geographic segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales (gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations as
compared to the second quarter of 2012 due to the LIFO benefit discussed above and improvements in hardlines and softlines. The gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased due to our continued investment in merchandise pricing,
primarily in fresh foods. The gross margin percentage in our Other International operations was unchanged.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points compared to the first half of 2012. Our core
merchandise categories gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased four basis points, due to decreases in food and sundries and fresh foods margins. Gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percent of
core merchandise (rather than net) sales, increased three basis points for the first half of 2013. This was primarily due to an increase in hardlines partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods. The gross margin comparison was positively impacted
by three basis points due to an $11 LIFO benefit in the first half of 2013 compared to a charge of $3 in the prior year. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership 2% reward program negatively impacted gross margin by one basis point due to
increased spending by Executive Members. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin increased eight basis points in the first half of 2013. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by
approximately $26 in the first half of 2013. The gross margin percentage in our U.S. operations increased as compared to the first half of 2012 due to
the LIFO benefit discussed above. The gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations increased in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The gross margin percentage in our Other International operations increased, primarily in our food
and sundries category. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. Our warehouse
operating costs as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged from the prior year. Leveraging of payroll costs as a result of increased net sales was offset by increases in employee benefits, predominately healthcare and workers compensation
expenses. Additionally, higher stock compensation expense increased our SG&A percentage by two basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by approximately $9 in the second quarter of
2013. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased two basis points compared to the first half of 2012. This improvement was partially due
to contributions made to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in Washington State in the first quarter of 2012, with no comparable charge in 2013, which resulted in a positive impact of four basis points. In addition, our warehouse
operating costs improved four basis points largely due to leveraging of our payroll costs as a result of increased net sales which was partially offset by increased workers compensation expense. The overall warehouse operating cost
improvements were offset by higher stock compensation expense and higher central operating costs, predominately related to the continuing modernization of our information systems and related activities, which increased our SG&A percentage by
three basis points each. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by approximately $19 in the first half of 2013.

Our current year consolidated effective tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits of $72,
primarily due to a $62 tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend paid by the Company to employees, who through the Companys 401(k) Retirement Plan, own Company stock in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Dividends paid on these
shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2012 was adversely impacted by a net discrete expense
of $26 relating primarily to the adverse impact of an audit of Costco Mexico by the Mexican tax authority and the tax effects of nondeductible expenses for our contributions to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in Washington State.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $1,148 and $1,161 at February 17, 2013, and September 2, 2012, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales within the last week of our
respective fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,525 in the first half of 2013, compared to $1,244 in the
first half of 2012, an increase of $281. This increase was primarily attributable to a $235 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests and a $117 decrease in cash used for our net investment in merchandise inventories. These increases
in operating cash flow were partially offset by a $110 decrease in the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in
investing activities totaled $855 in the first half of 2013 compared to $452 in the first half of 2012, an increase of $403. This increase was primarily attributable to a $311 increase in the cash used to fund warehouse expansion and remodeling
programs. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $235 in the first half of 2013 compared to net cash used of $392 in the first half of 2012,
an increase of $627. This increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $3,496 from the issuance of $3,500 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes partially offset by cash dividend payments of $3,169. Additionally, there was a $276
decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. We believe that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital
requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries as we deem such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. We believe that our
U.S. current asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and we have no current plans to repatriate the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by these subsidiaries for use in the U.S. At February 17,
2013, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $2,013 were held by these non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries.

Dividends On November 28, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2012. This dividend was paid on
December 18, 2012 in the amount of $3,049. On January 24, 2013, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 8, 2013. This dividend was paid on February 22, 2013.
Expansion Plans Our primary requirement
for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current
expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,000 during fiscal 2013 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related
operations, and continuing the modernization of our information systems. Through the first half of fiscal 2013, we have spent approximately $943. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and
existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 14 new warehouses in the first half of 2013. Our plans for the remainder of
fiscal 2013 are to open up to 14 additional new warehouses. Bank Credit Facilities We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of February 17, 2013, we had total borrowing capacity within these
facilities of $714, of which $395 was maintained by our international operations. Of the $395 maintained by our international operations, $196 is guaranteed by the Company. There was $64 of outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank
credit facilities at the end of second quarter of 2013. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $153. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of second quarter of 2013
was $111, including $94 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within one year, and generally, we intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration.
The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at that time.Financing Activities On December 7, 2012, we issued $3,500 in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes as follows: $1,200 of 0.65% Senior Notes due December 7, 2015; $1,100 of 1.125% Senior Notes due December 15, 2017; and $1,200 of 1.7% Senior Notes due December 15, 2019. The proceeds from the issuance of these Senior Notes were
used primarily to pay the special cash dividend on our common stock. The balance of approximately $450 will be used for general corporate purposes. Contractual Obligations Other than the issuance of
the Senior Notes described above, as of the date of this report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year.

Stock Repurchase Programs There was no stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program in the second quarter of 2013. In the second quarter of 2012, we repurchased 1,759,000 shares, at an average price of $82.20, totaling $145.
In the first half of 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 357,000 shares and 3,881,000 shares, at an average price of $96.41 and $81.84, for a total expenditure of $34 and $318, respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our
approved plan was $3,055 at February 17, 2013. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance
with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2012. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.
Item 3Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign-currency exchange rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2012.
Item 4Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share data and warehouse number data)
(unaudited)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At November 24, 2013, Costco operated 646 warehouses worldwide: 460 in the United States (U.S.) (in 43 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico), 86 in Canada, 33 in Mexico, 25 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Japan, 10 in Taiwan, 9 in Korea, and 5 in Australia. The Company's online business operates websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Mexico.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest, consolidated entities in which it has made equity investments, or has other interests through which it has majority-voting control or it exercises the right to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s performance (Costco or the Company). The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and other consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to noncontrolling interests in Taiwan and Korea. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's annual report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2013.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarters of  2014 and 2013 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 24, 2013 and November 25, 2012, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company’s previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements.Table of ContentsNote 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

7


Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market               data.Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The Company’s current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. The Company’s long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques utilized in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities as disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2013.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, when actual inflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. At November 24, 2013, and September 1, 2013, the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories was $82 and $81, respectively.
Derivatives
The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $416 and $458 at November 24, 2013, and September 1, 2013, respectively. The Company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the Company has an established banking relationship. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts as of November 24, 2013, and September 1, 2013.The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in the first quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively.Table of ContentsNote 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes, particularly electricity and natural gas, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark-to-market adjustment.

8


Foreign Currency
The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. Generally, this includes the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items resulted in a net gain of $9 in the first quarters of 2014 and 2013.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. See Note 5 for additional information.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. An entity will be required to disclose the net income line items impacted by significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the item is reclassified in its entirety. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, cross-references to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP are required to provide additional detail. The new guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of 2014. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

Note 5—Equity and Comprehensive Income
Dividends
The Company’s current quarterly dividend rate is $0.31 per share, compared to $0.275 per share in the first quarter of 2013. On October 29, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of  $0.31 per share, which was paid on November 29, 2013.
Stock Repurchase Programs
There was no stock repurchase activity in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2013, we repurchased 357,000 shares, at an average price of $96.41, totaling $34. The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under our approved plan was $3,055 at November 24, 2013. These amounts differ from the stock repurchase balances in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.Table of ContentsNote 5—Equity and Comprehensive Income (Continued)

Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation Plans
In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Fifth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan was amended following shareholder approval and is now referred to as the Sixth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Sixth Plan). The Sixth Plan initially authorized the issuance of 16,000,000  shares (9,143,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants in addition to shares authorized under the previous plan. Each RSU is counted as 1.75  shares toward the limit of shares available. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares equal to the minimum statutory withholding taxes.Table of ContentsNote 6—Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued)

Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. As of the date of this report, the Company has not recorded an accrual with respect to any matter described below. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss cannot in our view be reasonably estimated because, among other things, (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified, (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.The Company is a defendant in the following matters, among others:A case brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California state law. Shirley “Rae” Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (San Francisco), Case Table of ContentsNote 8—Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)No. C-04-3341-EMC. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, interest and attorneys’ fees. Class certification was granted by the district court on January 11, 2007. On September 16, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the order of class certification and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. On September 25, 2012, the district court certified a class of women in the United States denied promotion to warehouse general manager or assistant general manager since January 3, 2002. Currently the class is believed to be approximately 1,300 people. In October 2013 the parties reached an agreement in principle on a settlement, which is subject to  court approval. A hearing is set for February 6, 2014. Any payments to class members would be contingent upon proof of liability in individual adjudications.  Payments under the settlement would be immaterial to the Company’s operations or financial position.Numerous putative class actions have been brought around the United States against motor fuel retailers, including the Company, alleging that they have been overcharging consumers by selling gasoline or diesel that is warmer than 60 degrees without adjusting the volume sold to compensate for heat-related expansion or disclosing the effect of such expansion on the energy equivalent received by the consumer. The Company is named in the following actions: Raphael Sagalyn, et al., v. Chevron USA, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-430 (D. Md.); Phyllis Lerner, et al., v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, et al., Case No. 07-1216 (C.D. Cal.); Linda A. Williams, et al., v. BP Corporation North America, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-179 (M.D. Ala.); James Graham, et al. v.

Amoco Oil Company, et al., Case No. 07-cv-00661 (D. Utah); and Mark Wyatt, et al., v. B. P. America Corp., et al., Case No. 07-1754 (S.D. Cal.). On June 18, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assigned the action, entitled In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litigation, MDL Docket No 1840, to Judge Kathryn Vratil in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. On April 12, 2009, the Company agreed to settle the actions in which it is named as a defendant. Under the settlement, which is subject to final approval by the court, the Company agreed, to the extent allowed by law, to install over five years from the effective date of the settlement temperature-correcting dispensers in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Other than payments to class representatives, the settlement does not provide for cash payments to class members. On September 22, 2011, the court preliminarily approved a revised settlement, which did not materially alter the terms. On April 24, 2012, the court granted final approval of the revised settlement. A class member who objected has filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement. Plaintiffs have moved for an award of $10 million in attorneys’ fees, as well as an award of costs and payments to class representatives. The Company has opposed the motion.On October 4, 2006, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, seeking records relating to the Company’s receipt and handling of hazardous merchandise returned by Costco members and other records. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorney’s Office.Table of ContentsNote 8—Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)The Environmental Protection Agency issued an Information Request to the Company, dated November 1, 2007, regarding warehouses in the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada and relating to compliance with regulations concerning air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. On March 4, 2009, the Company was advised by the Department of Justice that the Department was prepared to allege that the Company has committed at least nineteen violations of the leak-repair requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 82.156(i) and at least seventy-four violations of the recordkeeping requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 82.166(k), (m) at warehouses in these states. The Company has responded to these allegations, is engaged in communications with the Department about these and additional allegations, and has entered into tolling agreements. Substantial penalties may be levied for violations of the Clean Air Act. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry.The Company has received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records of the Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed property subject to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief.The Company has received from the Drug Enforcement Administration subpoenas and administrative inspection warrants concerning the Company's fulfillment of prescriptions related to controlled substances and related practices. The Company is seeking to cooperate with these processes.The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter.

Note 9—Segment Reporting
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2013, and Note 1 above. All material inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International Operations, but are included in the U.S. Operations because those costs are not allocated internally and generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

OVERVIEW
We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid turnover. This turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters.We believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth.  We define comparable warehouse sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales.   Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts that they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of currency fluctuations, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, including a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, and department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful

historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged, but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. This may cause us, for example, to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members, negatively impacting gross margin.We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and, to a much lesser extent, relocating existing warehouses to larger and better-located facilities. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. However, the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.Our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Part I, Item 1, Note 9 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less direct membership warehouse competition. Additionally, we operate our lower-margin gasoline business predominately in the United States and Canada. We opened our first gasoline station in Australia in November 2013. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is typically calculated as the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 24, 2013 and November 25, 2012, respectively.  Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.

Key items for the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the first quarter of 2013 include:•We opened 13 new warehouses in the first quarter of 2014, nine in the U.S., one in Canada, and three in our Other International segment, compared to nine new warehouses in the first quarter of 2013. •Net sales increased 5% to $24,468, driven by a 3% increase in comparable sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2013 and 2014. Net and comparable sales were negatively impacted by changes in certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and by decreases in the price of gasoline;•Membership fees increased 7% to $549, primarily due to membership sign-ups at both new and existing warehouses;  •Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased thirteen basis points; •Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seventeen basis points;•Net income in 2014 increased 2% to $425, or $0.96 per diluted share compared to $416, or $0.95 per diluted share in 2013; and•On October 29, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.31 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of the first quarter.

Net Sales
Net Sales increased $1,264 or 5% during the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013.  This increase was attributable to a 3% increase in comparable warehouse sales and from sales at the 29 net new warehouses (includes the closure of our Acapulco, Mexico location due to extensive damage sustained during tropical storm Manuel) opened since the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013.

(amounts in millions, except per share and share data, and warehouse number data)

Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $355, or 153 basis points, during the first quarter of 2014. The negative impact was primarily due to the Canadian dollar and Japanese yen of approximately $209 and $141, respectively. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $245 or 105 basis points during the first quarter of 2014, due to a 9% decrease in the average sales price per gallon.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 3% in the first quarter of 2014 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by lower average amounts spent by our members. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and gasoline prices negatively impacted comparable sales results, including the average amount spent by our members, during the first quarter of 2014. The increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).


Membership Fees

Membership fees increased 7% in the first quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to  membership sign-ups at both new and existing warehouses, increased penetration of our higher-fee Executive Membership program, and the impact of raising our annual membership fees. Our member renewal rates are currently 90% in the U.S. and Canada, and 87% on a worldwide basis.  We increased our annual membership fee in the U.S. and Canada effective November 1, 2011, for new members, and January 1, 2012, for renewal members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues of approximately $8 in the first quarter of 2014. The remaining impact of this fee increase will be immaterial.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased thirteen basis points compared to the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation, gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points. Gross margin in our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods) when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased three basis points, primarily due to increases in softlines and food and sundries. This was partially offset by a decrease in hardlines as a result of lower sales penetration. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed

as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points, predominately in our e-commerce and pharmacy businesses.  These increases were partially offset by a lower gross margin in our gasoline business. Additionally, gross margin was negatively impacted by two basis points due to continued growth of the Executive Membership 2% reward program, and one basis point due to a LIFO charge of $1 recorded in 2014 compared to a benefit of $2 in 2013.  Gross margin on a geographic segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment’s own sales (gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operation primarily due to food and sundries and softlines.     The gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations increased slightly, resulting from an increase in fresh foods partially offset by decreases in hardlines and food and sundries.  The gross margin percentage in our Other International segment decreased, primarily in softlines and fresh foods.

SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased seventeen basis points compared to the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales, SG&A expenses increased seven basis points. This increase, driven by higher stock compensation expense of five basis points resulting primarily from appreciation in the trading price of the Company's common stock, occurred despite a 14% reduction in the average number of RSUs granted to each participant during the quarter.  Additionally, central operating costs increased two basis points, primarily related to the continued investment in the modernization of our information systems in our U.S. operations. Warehouse operating costs as a percentage of net sales adjusted for gasoline price deflation were flat, resulting from leveraging of our payroll costs in our U.S. and Canadian operations, offset by increases in other operating costs, primarily employee benefits.

Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market.

The decrease in foreign-currency transaction gains, net in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 was primarily attributable to the negative impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to forward foreign exchange contracts entered into by our foreign subsidiaries as the U.S. dollar weakened in certain international locations compared to the prior year. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Part I, Item I, Note 1 of this report.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6,439 and $6,124 at November 24, 2013, and September 1, 2013.  Of these balances, approximately $1,396 and $1,254 represented debit and credit card receivables at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and of fiscal year 2013, respectively, primarily related to sales within the last week of our fiscal quarter or fiscal year.Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries as we deem such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested.  We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements, and we have no current plans to repatriate the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by these subsidiaries for use in the U.S.  At November 24, 2013, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $2,484 were held by these non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries.

(amounts in millions, except per share and share data, and warehouse number data)


Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $939 in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $1,102 in the first quarter of 2013. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Our cash flow used in operations generally consist of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, depreciation, and credit card processing fees. We had an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories due to the shift in timing of the Thanksgiving holiday as compared to the first quarter of 2013.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $826 in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $855 in the first quarter of 2013. Our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
We opened 13 new warehouses in the first quarter of 2014.  For the remainder of fiscal 2014 we plan to open up to 18 additional warehouses. Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,400 during fiscal 2014 for real estate, construction, remodeling, equipment for warehouses and related operations, and the modernization of our information systems and related activities. Through the end of first quarter of fiscal 2014, we have spent approximately $574.  These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities totaled $71 in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $121 provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2013. We had a smaller increase in financing cash flows from bank checks outstanding during the first quarter of 2014 due to maintaining higher cash balances in banks on which our checks are drawn.
Stock Repurchase Programs
There was no stock repurchase activity in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2013, we repurchased 357,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $96.41, totaling approximately $34. These amounts differ from the stock repurchase balances in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,055 at November 24, 2013. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.
Dividends
Our current quarterly cash dividend rate is $0.31 per share, or $1.24 per share on an annualized basis.  On October 29, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share payable to shareholders of record on November 15, 2013.  The dividend was paid on November 29, 2013.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of November 24, 2013, we had total borrowing capacity within these facilities of $453, of which $384 was maintained by our international operations. Of the $384 maintained by our international operations, $180 is guaranteed by the Company. There were $54 of outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and $36 outstanding as of the end of fiscal year 2013. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $154. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2014 was $97, including $92 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within one year, and generally, we intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at that time.
Contractual Obligations
As of the date of this report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2013. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that report.

Item 4—Controls and Procedures

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

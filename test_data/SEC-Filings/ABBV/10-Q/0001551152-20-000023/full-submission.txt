Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

Note 1    Basis of Presentation


Basis of Historical Presentation
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.It is management’s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and operating results. Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period interim condensed consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding this acquisition.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2016-13
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking "expected credit loss" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.Upon adoption of the standard, accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. There were no significant changes in credit loss risk factors that impacted the company's recorded allowance during the six months ended June 30, 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
ASU No. 2019-12
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2021. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3    Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:
Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30,(in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2020 2019Basic EPS        Net earnings (loss) attributable to AbbVie Inc. $(738) $741 $2,272 $3,197Earnings allocated to participating securities 18 8 28 17Earnings available to common shareholders $(756) $733 $2,244 $3,180Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,647 1,480 1,564 1,480Basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $(0.46) $0.49 $1.44 $2.15         Diluted EPS        Net earnings (loss) attributable to AbbVie Inc. $(738) $741 $2,272 $3,197Earnings allocated to participating securities 18 8 28 17Earnings available to common shareholders $(756) $733 $2,244 $3,180Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,647 1,480 1,564 1,480Effect of dilutive securities — 4 4 3Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,647 1,484 1,568 1,483Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $(0.46) $0.49 $1.43 $2.14
Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented.

Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements



Acquisition of Allergan
On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. The combination creates a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) $120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock.

2020 Form 10-Q | 9




Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows:
(in millions) Cash consideration paid to Allergan shareholders (a)$39,675Fair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders (b)23,979Fair value of AbbVie equity awards issued to Allergan equity award holders (c)430Total consideration$64,084
(a)Represents cash consideration transferred of $120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing.(b)Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020 closing price of $83.96 per share.
(c)Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders.The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of June 30, 2020. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill, property and equipment, inventories and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:
(in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents$1,537Short-term investments1,421Accounts receivable2,423Inventories2,370Prepaid expenses and other current assets1,984Investments137Property and equipment1,912Intangible assets Developed product rights58,280In-process research and development1,040Other noncurrent assets1,532Short-term borrowings(60)Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations(1,899)Accounts payable and accrued liabilities(5,850)Long-term debt and finance lease obligations(18,937)Deferred income taxes(4,078)Other long-term liabilities(4,772)Total identifiable net assets37,040Goodwill27,044Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed$64,084
The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $1.2 billion is being amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be within approximately one year from the acquisition date.

2020 Form 10-Q | 10




Intangible assets relate to $58.3 billion of developed product rights and $1.0 billion of in-process research and development (IPR&D). The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately        9 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the "income approach" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of products sold, research and development (R&D) costs, selling and marketing costs and contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt.Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through June 30, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $2.0 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $909 million, inclusive of $961 million of intangible asset amortization and $431 million of inventory fair value step-up amortization.Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $777 million for the three months and $781 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and $24 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and were included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
Pro Forma Financial Information
The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019:

Note 7    Integration and Restructuring Plans

Allergan Integration Plan
Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period, with approximately 50% realized in R&D, 40% in SG&A and 10% in cost of products sold. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur approximately $2 billion of charges through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.

Note 8

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy
See Note 11 to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a summary of AbbVie's risk management policy and use of derivative instruments.
Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion at June 30, 2020 and $957 million at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2020 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $2.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $7.0 billion at June 30, 2020 and $7.1 billion at December 31, 2019.The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling €971 million, £204 million and CHF62 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The company also had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €7.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and €3.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.AbbVie is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $4.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Fair Value Measures
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:•Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;•Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and•Level 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020:

Equity securities consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of
June 30, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:
RangeWeighted average(a)Discount rate0.5% - 2.6%1.6%Probability of payment for unachieved milestones16% - 57%54%Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)16% - 100%89%Projected year of payments2020 - 20342027
(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.
(b) Excludes early stage indications with 0% estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100% probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 16% to 56% at June 30, 2020.

Concentrations of Risk
Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 73% as of June 30, 2020 and 68% as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of AbbVie’s net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers.

Debt and Credit Facilities
Allergan-Related Financing
In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, in May 2020, the company borrowed $3.0 billion under a $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement, of which $1.0 billion was outstanding under a floating rate three-year term loan tranche and $2.0 billion outstanding under a floating rate five-year term loan tranche as of June 30, 2020. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. In May 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash. Following the settlement of the exchange offers, AbbVie issued $14.0 billion and €3.1 billion of new notes in exchange for the Allergan notes tendered in the exchange offers. The aggregate principal amount of Allergan notes that remained outstanding following the settlement of the exchange offers was approximately $1.5 billion and €635 million. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of the assumed debt instruments.

Note 11 Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 7% income tax expense on pre-tax loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 6% income tax expense on pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The effective tax rate was 8% and 5% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2020 over prior year was principally due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible Allergan acquisition related costs, the impact of changes in contingent consideration liabilities and collaboration related costs. These contributed to net income tax expense on a pre-tax loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $156 million.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $330 million as of June 30, 2020 and $290 million as of December 31, 2019. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.A lawsuit against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others remains pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for pre-trial purposes under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2084. This case, brought by a direct AndroGel purchaser, generally alleges Solvay's 2006 patent litigation settlement agreements and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks monetary damages and attorneys' fees. This lawsuit is no longer material to AbbVie and AbbVie will no longer report on this case.In September 2014, the FTC filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $448 million, plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTC’s request for injunctive relief. AbbVie is appealing the court’s liability and disgorgement rulings and, based on an assessment of the merits of that appeal, no liability has been accrued for this matter. The FTC is also appealing aspects of the court’s trial ruling and the dismissal of its settlement-related claim.In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, making allegations similar to those in In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation (No. II), MDL No. 2084 (above) and FTC v.

(a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460.

In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In June 2020, the California Supreme Court reversed a lower court's ruling and held that the District Attorney’s suit may proceed on a statewide basis.Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect Humira purchasers, alleging that AbbVie’s settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVie’s Humira patent portfolio violate state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation. In June 2020, the court dismissed the consolidated litigation with prejudice. The plaintiffs have indicated they plan to appeal.In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al., in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act.In September 2018, the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance intervened in a qui tam lawsuit, State of California and Lazaro Suarez v. AbbVie Inc., et al., brought under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, in California Superior Court for Alameda County. The Department of Insurance’s complaint alleged that, through patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value provided in connection with Humira, AbbVie caused the submission of fraudulent commercial insurance claims for Humira in violation of the California statute. The complaint sought injunctive relief, an assessment of up to three times the amount of the claims at issue, and civil penalties. AbbVie has reached a resolution of the Department of Insurance's lawsuit that allows AbbVie to continue to operate its Humira patient support program. In addition, a federal securities lawsuit (Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al.) is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief

2020 Form 10-Q | 26

The lawsuit, Elfers v. Gonzalez, et al., alleges that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value, as alleged in the State of California case discussed above, and in connection with the announcements of results of AbbVie’s 2018 Dutch auction tender offer.In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.Product liability cases were filed in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 3,500 claims against AbbVie are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation, MDL No. 2545. Approximately 175 claims against AbbVie are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In November 2018, AbbVie entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in the MDL encompassing existing claims in all courts. All proceedings in pending cases are effectively stayed during the settlement administration process.Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote. Approximately 95 cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and approximately 14 others are pending in various federal and state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages.

Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies, and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Namenda, are consolidated as In re: Namenda Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar lawsuits brought by direct purchasers of Namenda were resolved and dismissed in May 2020.Lawsuits are pending against Allergan Inc. generally alleging that Allergan’s petitioning to the U.S. Patent Office and Food and Drug Administration, and other conduct by Allergan, involving Restasis violated federal and state antitrust laws, and state unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Restasis, are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the MDL Rules as In re: Restasis (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion) Antitrust Litigation, MDL 2819. In June 2020, the court certified a class of indirect purchasers of Restasis. Similar lawsuits brought by direct purchasers of Restasis are subject to a settlement that was preliminarily approved by the court in May 2020 and is pending final approval, and by Restasis direct purchaser assignees were resolved and dismissed in March 2020.Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan’s former Actavis generics unit and its alleged anticompetitive conduct with other generic drug companies. The lawsuits were filed by Allergan shareholders and consist of three purported class actions and one individual action that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey as In re: Allergan Generic Drug Pricing Securities Litigation, and one individual action that is pending in New Jersey state court.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
, “
.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain aesthetic products and devices are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 47,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment.
2020 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition to create a more diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across Allergan's therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing incremental debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $19.0 billion, operating earnings of $4.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and cash flows from operations of $6.9 billion. Worldwide net revenues grew by 18% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis, which included $2.0 billion of contributed revenues from the Allergan acquisition, growth in the immunology portfolio from Skyrizi, Rinvoq and the continued strength of Humira in the U.S. as well as revenue growth from Imbruvica and Venclexta.

2020 Form 10-Q | 31




Diluted earnings per share was $1.43 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and included the following after-tax costs:                     (i) $1.9 billion of expenses related to the Allergan acquisition; (ii) $1.6 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets;            (iii) $881 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) $853 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); and (v) $164 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.
Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. In June 2020, AbbVie announced that it has entered into a collaboration with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic to prevent and treat COVID-19. Additionally, AbbVie donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity, supply critical equipment and deliver food and essential supplies during the crisis. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative therapies and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The Allergan acquisition added several early-to-late stage pipeline assets in key areas, such as aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and general medicine. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next 12 months.
Significant Programs and Developments
Immunology
Rinvoq
•In February 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial of Rinvoq in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Results from the SELECT-PsA 1 study, which evaluated Rinvoq versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), showed that both doses of Rinvoq met the primary and key secondary endpoints. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.•In May 2020, AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, in June 2020, submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.•In June 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 Measure Up 1 study and, in July 2020, announced top-line results from its Phase 3 Measure Up 2 and AD Up studies of Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis met all primary and secondary endpoints versus placebo.

•In April 2020, AbbVie received FDA approval for the use of Imbruvica in combination with rituximab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
Venclexta
•In February 2020, AbbVie announced that the Phase 3 VIALE-C trial of Venclexta in combination with low-dose cytarabine in newly-diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) did not meet its primary endpoint. •In March 2020, AbbVie announced that top-line results from its Phase 3 VIALE-A trial of Venclexta in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML met its primary endpoints. •In March 2020, AbbVie received European Commission (EC) approval of Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with previously untreated CLL. •In May 2020, AbbVie submitted a supplemental NDA (sNDA) to the FDA for the conversion of the conditional approval of Venclexta to full approval for patients with AML. In June 2020, AbbVie submitted an MAA to the EMA for Venclyxto for the treatment of patients with AML.
Aesthetics
Juvederm Collection
•In June 2020, AbbVie received FDA approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for the augmentation of the chin region to improve the chin profile in adults over the age of 21.

Atogepant
•In July 2020, AbbVie announced that the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial evaluating atogepant, an orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, for migraine prevention met its primary endpoint for all doses (10mg, 30mg, and 60mg) compared to placebo, all secondary endpoints with 30mg and 60mg doses, and four out of six secondary endpoints with the 10mg dose.
Virology/Liver Disease
Mavyret
•In March 2020, AbbVie announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for Maviret to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with genotype 3 infection.
Eye Care
Abicipar pegol
•In June 2020, AbbVie announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to the Biologics License Application (BLA) for abicipar pegol, a novel, investigational DARPin therapy for patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The CRL indicated that the rate of intraocular inflammation observed following administration of abicipar pegol results in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio in the treatment of nAMD. In July 2020, AbbVie withdrew the regulatory application with the EMA for abicipar pegol for the treatment of nAMD. AbbVie plans to  meet with the FDA and EMA to discuss their comments and determine next steps.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

In the United States, Humira sales increased 5% for the three months and 9% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by market growth across all indications, partially offset by lower new patient starts in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 17% for the three months and 15% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets.Net revenues for Skyrizi increased more than 100% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by higher patient volumes over the prior year following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Net revenues for Rinvoq were $149 million for the three months and $235 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 following the August 2019 FDA approval and December 2019 EC approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie’s 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 17% for the three months and 19% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as a result of continued penetration of Imbruvica for patients with CLL, partially offset by lower new patient starts in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Net revenues for Venclexta increased by 81% for the three months and 96% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL and relapsed/refractory CLL.Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics were $226 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics were $113 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas were $297 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania were $192 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Global Mavyret sales decreased by 51% for the three months and 40% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by competitive dynamics in the U.S. and lower patient volumes in certain international markets, including lower new patient starts in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Net revenues for Creon decreased by 2% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 driven by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Creon increased by 9% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by continued market growth, partially offset by lower new patient starts in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market with approximately 80% total market share.

Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year. Gross margin percentage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was unfavorably impacted by higher amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value step-up adjustments associated with the Allergan acquisition as well as collaboration profit sharing arrangements for Imbruvica and Venclexta.

R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and were flat for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year. R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 included costs associated with the acquired Allergan R&D pipeline for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition.Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPR&D expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There were no individually significant transactions during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

Other Non-Operating Expenses
Three months endedJune 30, Six months endedJune 30,(in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019Interest expense $632 $358 $1,195 $745Interest income (18) (49) (153) (111)Interest expense, net $614 $309 $1,042 $634         Net foreign exchange loss $29 $6 $34 $12Other expense, net 802 2,278 874 2,413
Interest expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to incremental interest and debt issuance costs associated with financing the Allergan acquisition and outstanding Allergan debt acquired, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s debt obligations.Interest income decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates. Interest income increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates.Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $809 million for the three months and $881 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and $2.3 billion for the three months and $2.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the change in fair value represented lower discount rates and the passage of time. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the change in fair value represented higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and declining interest rates.

Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate was 7% income tax expense on pre-tax loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 6% income tax expense on pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The effective tax rate was 8% and 5% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2020 over prior year was principally due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible Allergan acquisition related costs, the impact of changes in contingent consideration liabilities and collaboration related costs. These contributed to net income tax expense on a pre-tax loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Six months endedJune 30,(in millions)2020 2019Cash flows provided by (used in):   Operating activities$6,904 $5,494Investing activities(35,781) (167)Financing activities(4,992) (7,453)
Operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 increased compared to the prior year and included the results of Allergan subsequent to the May 8 acquisition date. Operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were favorably impacted by lower payments for income taxes and higher net revenues of the combined company partially offset by acquisition-related cash expenses.Investing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion. Investing cash flows also included capital expenditures of $302 million, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.4 billion and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $192 million. Investing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $508 million, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $440 million and capital expenditures of $235 million.Financing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes at maturity. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Cash dividend payments totaled $3.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and $3.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in cash dividend payments was driven by an increase in the quarterly dividend rate. On June 17, 2020, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.18 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on July 15, 2020, payable on August 14, 2020. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $500 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 4 million shares for $300 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019.During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.

2020 Form 10-Q | 39




Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. AbbVie has assessed credit risk in these countries and currently does not believe the economic conditions in these countries will have a significant impact on the company’s liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance of receivables outstanding as of June 30, 2020. AbbVie will continue to monitor information as it becomes available with respect to COVID-19 and evaluate any expected impact on the company’s receivables.
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At June 30, 2020, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
Credit Ratings
Following the acquisition of Allergan, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. There have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2020.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES


DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Changes in internal control over financial reporting. As of June 30, 2020, management is in the process of integrating the internal controls of the acquired Allergan business into AbbVie's existing operations as part of planned integration activities. There were no other changes in AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


Information pertaining to legal proceedings is provided in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS


There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in AbbVie’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, except for the following:
Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), could adversely impact AbbVie's operations and financial condition.
Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could adversely impact AbbVie's operations and financial condition. In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was designated a global pandemic and many countries, including the United States, declared national emergencies and implemented preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders. The spread of COVID-19 has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie's employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie's employees, patients, customers and business partners.The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to-date has not been material, but over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, the outbreak could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition.

AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

Note 1 Basis of Presentation

Basis of Historical Presentation
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.It is management’s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and operating results. Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.
During the three months ended March 31, 2022, AbbVie revised its classification of development milestone expense associated with licensing and collaboration arrangements in the consolidated statement of earnings. Milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval, which were previously included in research and development expense, are now presented as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense. The reclassification decreased research and development expense and increased acquired IPR&D and milestones expense by $35 million for the three months and $150 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The company believes this presentation assists users of the financial statements to better understand the total upfront and subsequent development milestone payments incurred to acquire in-process research and development projects. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification had no impact on total operating costs and expenses, operating earnings, net earnings, net earnings attributable to AbbVie, Inc., earnings per share, or total equity. Certain other reclassifications were made to conform the prior period interim condensed consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.

Note 3 Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:

Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented.

The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues.

Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.7 billion at June 30, 2022 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2022 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $7.2 billion at June 30, 2022 and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2021.The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling €4.8 billion at June 30, 2022 and €4.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The company also had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €5.9 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $4.5 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Fair Value Measures
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:•Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;•Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and•Level 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022:

Money market funds and time deposits are valued using relevant observable market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets and interest rate curves. Equity securities consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, probabilities of achieving the milestones, time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:
June 30, 2022December 31, 2021(in millions)RangeWeighted average(a)RangeWeighted average(a)Discount rate2.4% - 4.8%4.1%0.2%- 2.6%1.7%Probability of payment for unachieved milestones89% - 100%95%89% - 100%90%Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)56% - 100%99%56% - 100%96%Projected year of payments2022 - 203420272022 - 2034 2027
(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.(b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56% to 89% at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

AbbVie also holds investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $148 million as of June 30, 2022 and $149 million as of December 31, 2021. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of June 30, 2022.
Concentrations of Risk
Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 76% as of June 30, 2022 and 75% as of December 31, 2021, and substantially all of AbbVie’s pharmaceutical product net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers.

Note 11 Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 22% for the three months and 11% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 34% for the three months and 14% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and accretion on contingent consideration. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 over the prior year was primarily due to differences in the company’s jurisdictional mix of earnings and accretion on contingent consideration.
Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $145 million.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal
2022 Form 10-Q | 19


proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.
Antitrust Litigation
Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payors. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020 and August 2021, the court denied the end-payors' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. In May 2020, Perrigo Company and related entities filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others, alleging that Abbott’s 2011 AndroGel patent lawsuit filed against Perrigo was sham litigation. In September 2021, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted AbbVie's motion for judgment on the pleadings in the Perrigo lawsuit, dismissing it with prejudice. Perrigo has appealed the dismissal.Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect Humira purchasers, alleging that AbbVie’s settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVie’s Humira patent portfolio violated state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation. In June 2020, the court dismissed the consolidated litigation with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC, an AbbVie subsidiary, and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 50,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment.
2022 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $28.1 billion, operating earnings of $8.0 billion, diluted earnings per share of $3.03 and cash flows from operations of $9.9 billion. Worldwide net revenues grew by 4% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics portfolios.Diluted earnings per share was $3.03 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and included the following after-tax costs:                     (i) $3.1 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $1.9 billion for charges related to litigation matters; (iii) $875 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; and (iv) $219 million of acquisition and integration expenses. These costs were partially offset by an after-tax gain of $126 million related to the divestiture of Pylera. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.

Recent Global Events
Russia/Ukraine
In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as certain non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions and export controls on Russia and Belarus. These include restrictions on the export and transfer of products containing certain toxins, including Botox, to Russia and Belarus. With the exception of Botox, AbbVie is not prohibited to continue the sale of essential pharmaceutical products to help ensure patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. In March 2022, AbbVie announced the suspension of operations for all aesthetics products in Russia. In April 2022, AbbVie also announced that all profits from the sales of essential medicines in Russia will be donated to support direct humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. While the company’s operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are not significant, if the conflict escalates and results in broader economic and political concerns, AbbVie’s business could be adversely impacted.
Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
In response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace. AbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes approximately 80 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, more than 40 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

n/m – Not meaningfulThe following discussion and analysis of AbbVie’s net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis.Global Humira sales increased by 7% for the three months and 3% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased by 10% for the three months and 6% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased by 7% for the three months and 13% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets.Net revenues for Skyrizi increased by 88% for the three months and 78% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth. Net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Skyrizi for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Net revenues for Rinvoq increased by 61% for the three months and 59% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth. Net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis. Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie’s 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues decreased by 17% for the three months and 13% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as a result of decreased market demand and lower new patient starts in the United States. The decrease in net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was also partially offset by increased collaboration revenues.Net revenues for Venclexta increased by 21% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), relapsed/refractory CLL and acute myeloid leukemia.
2022 Form 10-Q | 31


Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics increased by 21% for the three months and 28% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to increased consumer demand driven by targeted brand investment. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection used in facial aesthetics decreased by 16% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 due to COVID-19 restrictions in China and suspension of aesthetic operations in Russia. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection increased 4% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to market growth partially offset by COVID-19 restrictions in China and suspension of aesthetic operations in Russia. In the United States, net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were unfavorably impacted by higher revenues in the prior year due to a one-time promotion in the three months ended June 30, 2021. Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas increased by 14% for the three months and 15% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to market growth.Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression increased by 14% for the three months and 18% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to higher market share and market growth.Net revenues for Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults increased by 48% for the three months and 56% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to increased market share uptake since launch.Net revenues for Mavyret decreased by 5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 due to the continued disruption of global HCV markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2022 Form 10-Q | 32


Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense represents upfront and subsequent development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the six months ended June 30, 2022 included a charge of $130 million as a result of acquiring Syndesi Therapeutics SA and its portfolio of novel modulators of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, including its lead molecule SDI-118, which is being evaluated to target nerve terminals to enhance synaptic efficiency. There were no individually significant transactions during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and the three and six months ended June 30, 2021.

Other Operating Income
Other operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 included $172 million of income related to the sale of worldwide commercial rights of a mature brand Pylera, which is used for the treatment of peptic ulcers with an infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 included $68 million of income related to the sale of a biologics facility.

Interest expense, net decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average debt balance as a result of deleveraging.Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $1.6 billion for the three months and $861 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and $2.7 billion for the three months and $2.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the change in fair value represented higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, partially offset by higher discount rates. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the change in fair value represented higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable Skyrizi clinical trial results and lower discount rates.

Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate was 22% for the three months and 11% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 34% for the three months and 14% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and accretion on contingent consideration. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 over the prior year was primarily due to differences in the company’s jurisdictional mix of earnings and accretion on contingent consideration.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Six months endedJune 30,(in millions)20222021Cash flows provided by (used in):Operating activities$9,913 $9,767 Investing activities(1,461)(584)Financing activities(9,651)(9,058)
Operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2022 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth, partially offset by the timing of working capital cash flows.Investing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included payments made for net purchases of investment securities totaling $1.4 billion, acquisitions and investments of $394 million and capital expenditures of $305 million. Investing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included capital expenditures of $383 million, payments made for acquisitions and investments of $345 million and net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $9 million. Financing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included repayment of $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of the company’s 3.45% senior notes. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $2.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2025 and issuance of a new $2.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in February 2022. Financing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included repayment of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company’s 2.3% senior notes, €750 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 0.5% senior euro notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes.Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $5.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and $4.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by the increase in the quarterly dividend rate.On June 23, 2022, the company announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.41 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on July 15, 2022, payable on August 15, 2022. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $1.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 5 million shares for $550 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At June 30, 2022, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
2022 Form 10-Q | 34


Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
Credit Ratings
In March 2022, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) affirmed its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and the Prime-2 short-term rating. At the same time, Moody’s revised the outlook to positive from stable. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2022.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
2022 Form 10-Q | 35


INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

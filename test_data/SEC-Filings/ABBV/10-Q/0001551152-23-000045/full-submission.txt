Note 3 Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:
Three months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,(in millions, except per share data)2023202220232022Basic EPSNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1,778 $3,949 $4,041 $9,363 Earnings allocated to participating securities11 18 32 43 Earnings available to common shareholders$1,767 $3,931 $4,009 $9,320 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding1,767 1,771 1,768 1,771 Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1.00 $2.22 $2.27 $5.26 Diluted EPSNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1,778 $3,949 $4,041 $9,363 Earnings allocated to participating securities11 18 32 43 Earnings available to common shareholders$1,767 $3,931 $4,009 $9,320 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding1,767 1,771 1,768 1,771 Effect of dilutive securities4 5 4 6 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding1,771 1,776 1,772 1,777 Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1.00 $2.21 $2.26 $5.24
Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented.

Collaborations

The company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.
Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.
In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.
The following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie:

(in millions)Balance as of December 31, 2022$32,156 Foreign currency translation adjustments(65)Balance as of September 30, 2023$32,091
The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. As of September 30, 2023, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses.
Intangible Assets, Net
The following table summarizes intangible assets:

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Amortization expense was $2.0 billion for the three months and $6.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and $2.0 billion for the three months and $5.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Amortization expense was included in cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.In August 2023, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the company’s oncology product Imbruvica sold in the United States (U.S.) was included on the list of products selected for negotiation by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The selection resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event
2023 Form 10-Q | 9


which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of $1.9 billion, which was lower than the carrying value of $4.0 billion and resulted in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount as of August 29, 2023. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.1 billion to cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023. The fair value measurement was based on Level 3 inputs including estimated net revenues, cost of products sold, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and discount rate. The remaining intangible asset carrying value related to Imbruvica in the U.S. totaled $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023.In September 2022, the company made a strategic decision to reduce ongoing sales and marketing investment related to Vuity, an on-market product to treat presbyopia. This strategic decision contributed to a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset resulting in a full impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $770 million to cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist.
During the first quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to revise the research and development plan for AGN-151607, a novel investigational neurotoxin for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiac surgery patients. This decision contributed to a delay in the estimated timing of regulatory approval as well as a significant decrease in estimated future cash flows of the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value which was below the carrying value of the intangible asset. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $630 million to research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2023.

Note 7 Integration and Restructuring Plans

Allergan Integration Plan
Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and incurred total cumulative charges of $2.5 billion through September 30, 2023.

Note 8 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy
See Note 11 to the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a summary of AbbVie’s risk management policy and use of derivative instruments.
Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $2.5 billion at September 30, 2023 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2022, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2023 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in 2019 and the resulting net gain was included in AOCI. This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. The company was a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges that matured in November 2022. The effect of the hedge contracts was to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses were included in AOCI and reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.In June 2023, the company entered into a cross-currency swap contract with a notional amount totaling €433 million to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in future cash flows of foreign currency denominated debt related to changes in foreign exchange rates. The cross-currency swap contract was designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively converted the interest and principal payments of the related foreign currency denominated debt to U.S. dollars. The unrealized gains and losses on the contract are included in AOCI and are reclassified to net foreign exchange loss over the term of the related debt.The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $6.8 billion at September 30, 2023 and $6.5 billion at December 31, 2022.The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €5.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and €5.9 billion at December 31, 2022. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling €4.9 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD750 million and CHF50 million at September 30, 2023 and €4.3 billion, SEK2.0 billion, CAD750 million and CHF90 million at December 31, 2022. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI
2023 Form 10-Q | 11


and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $5.0 billion at September 30, 2023 and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Fair Value Measures
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:•Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;•Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and•Level 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023:

Money market funds and time deposits are valued using relevant observable market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets and interest rate curves. Equity securities primarily consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market prices per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:
September 30, 2023December 31, 2022(in millions)RangeWeighted average(a)RangeWeighted average(a)Discount rate5.3% - 6.1%5.5%4.7%- 5.1%4.8%Probability of payment for unachieved milestones100% - 100%100%100% - 100%100%Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)89% - 100%99%56% - 100%99%Projected year of payments2023 - 203420272023 - 2034 2028
(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.(b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment was 89% at September 30, 2023 and 56% at December 31, 2022.

The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense (income), net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Contingent consideration payments of amounts up to the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from financing activities and payments of amounts in excess of the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

AbbVie also holds investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $131 million as of September 30, 2023 and $129 million as of December 31, 2022. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of September 30, 2023.

Note 11 Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 9% for the three months and 20% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 10% for the three months and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States and business development activities. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 and the three months ended September 30, 2022 were also impacted by changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 over the prior year was primarily due to changes in fair value of contingent consideration.
Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $620 million.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.
Antitrust Litigation
Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of six individual plaintiff lawsuits and a certified class action by Niaspan direct purchasers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. In November 2022, the State of Oregon filed a lawsuit in the Multnomah County, Oregon Circuit Court making similar allegations regarding the 2011 patent litigation with one of the generic companies.Lawsuits were filed against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, were consolidated as In re: Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In February 2023, the court granted Forest Laboratories’ motion to dismiss the cases, dismissing them with prejudice. Plaintiffs are appealing the court’s motion to dismiss ruling.
Government Proceedings
Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid products. Approximately 610 lawsuits are pending against Allergan in federal and state courts. Most of the federal court lawsuits are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804. Approximately 160 of the lawsuits are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Of these approximately 610 lawsuits, approximately 195 of them are brought by states, counties, cities, and other municipal entities. Three other lawsuits are brought by 3 Native American Tribes. AbbVie recorded a charge of $2.1 billion to selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2022 related to its settlement of over 2,500 lawsuits by states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, and Native American

tribes. Approximately 160 of the remaining 198 such lawsuits are in the process of being dismissed with prejudice pursuant to that settlement.In March 2023, AbbVie Inc. filed a petition in the United States Tax Court, AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The petition disputes the Internal Revenue Service determination concerning a $572 million income tax benefit recorded in 2014 related to a payment made to a third party for the termination of a proposed business combination.
Shareholder and Securities Litigation
In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2018 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. Lawsuits were filed against Allergan and certain of its former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants. The lawsuits, which were filed by Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities Litigation. The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to dismiss. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. In December 2022, the court granted Allergan's motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. Plaintiffs are appealing the court's motion to dismiss and summary judgment rulings.In May and July 2022, two shareholder derivative lawsuits, Treppel Family Trust v. Gonzalez et al., and Katcher v. Gonzalez, et al., were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached fiduciary and other legal duties in making or allowing alleged misstatements regarding the potential effect that safety information about another company’s product would have on the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and labeling for AbbVie’s Rinvoq.
Product Liability and General Litigation
In April 2023, a putative class action lawsuit, Camargo v. AbbVie Inc., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of Humira patients who paid for Humira based on its list price or who, after losing insurance coverage, discontinued Humira because they could not pay based on its list price, alleging that Humira’s list price is excessive in violation of multiple states’ unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes. The plaintiff generally seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees.In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator sought damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In March 2023, the court granted Allergan’s motion to dismiss, dismissing plaintiff-relator’s federal law claims with prejudice and state law claims without prejudice. The plaintiff-relator is appealing the court’s motion to dismiss ruling.
Intellectual Property Litigation
AbbVie Inc. is seeking to enforce patent rights relating to venetoclax (a drug sold under the trademark Venclexta). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in July 2020 against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; and Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Alembic Global Holdings SA. AbbVie alleges defendants’ proposed generic venetoclax products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Genentech, Inc., which is in a global collaboration with AbbVie concerning the development and marketing of Venclexta, is the co-plaintiff in this suit.

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees.
2023 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $40.0 billion, operating earnings of $9.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.26 and cash flows from operations of $18.1 billion. Worldwide net revenues decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis.Diluted earnings per share was $2.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and included the following after-tax costs:                     (i) $5.1 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $3.3 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; and (iii) $2.3 billion related to intangible asset impairment. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, over 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.

The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.
Significant Programs and Developments
Immunology
Rinvoq
•In March 2023, the European Commission (EC) issued their final decision on the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) review of the benefit-risk of medicines in the JAK inhibitor class for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including Rinvoq. Confirming the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion, the previously approved Rinvoq indication statements were not changed and the dosage and special warnings for all JAK inhibitors were updated to include additional information about the risks associated with JAK inhibitors. •In April 2023, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.•In May 2023, AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.•In July 2023, AbbVie initiated its Phase 3 Step-Up HS study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Rinvoq in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have failed anti-TNF therapy and/or one approved non-anti-TNF inhibitor therapy for HS.•In August 2023, AbbVie initiated its Phase 3 Select-SLE study to evaluate Rinvoq in moderate to severe systemic Lupus Erythematosus.•In October 2023, AbbVie announced that its Phase 2b study evaluating Rinvoq in adults with non-segmental Vitiligo met the primary endpoint. Based on these data, AbbVie is advancing the program to Phase 3.



Skyrizi
•In March 2023, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from its Phase 3 induction study, INSPIRE, for Skyrizi in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis met the primary and all secondary endpoints.•In June 2023, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from its Phase 3 maintenance study, COMMAND, for Skyrizi in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis met the primary and key secondary endpoints.•In July 2023, AbbVie announced results from the head-to-head Phase 4 IMMpulse study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Skyrizi compared to Otezla among adult patients with moderate plaque psoriasis (PsO) eligible for systemic therapy. In the study, significantly more patients achieved co-primary endpoints with Skyrizi versus Otezla. Skyrizi was well-tolerated with no new safety signals identified.•In August 2023, AbbVie submitted regulatory applications to FDA and EMA for Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.•In September 2023, AbbVie announced results from the head-to-head Phase 3 SEQUENCE study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Skyrizi compared to Stelara among adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. In the study, Skyrizi met both primary endpoints at week 24 and achieved superiority of endoscopic remission at week 48 versus Stelara. In addition, all secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance for superiority versus Stelara. Skyrizi was well-tolerated with no new safety signals identified.
Oncology
Epkinly
•In March 2023, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate epcoritamab in combination with R-CHOP compared to R-CHOP in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
2023 Form 10-Q | 26


•In May 2023, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Epkinly (epcoritamab) as the first and only bispecific antibody to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) DLBCL. •In September 2023, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Tepkinly (epcoritamab) for adults with R/R DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy.
Imbruvica
•In May 2023, AbbVie voluntarily withdrew, in the U.S., accelerated Imbruvica approvals for patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy and with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. This voluntary action is due to requirements related to the accelerated approval status granted by the FDA for MCL and MZL. Other approved indications for Imbruvica in the U.S. are not affected.
Navitoclax
•In July 2023, AbbVie announced top-line results from the Phase 3 TRANSFORM-1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of navitoclax, a BCL-XL/BCL-2 inhibitor, in combination with ruxolitinib in adult patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis (MF). The combination of navitoclax and ruxolitinib met the study’s primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in the number of patients who achieved Spleen Volume Reduction of at least 35 percent at week 24 compared to treatment with ruxolitinib and a placebo. The study did not meet the first ranked secondary endpoint of improvement in patients’ Total Symptom Score from baseline to week 24. The company plans to wait for additional follow up data on the primary, secondary and other endpoints, expected in the fourth quarter of this year, before engaging with regulatory agencies regarding potential next steps.
Venclexta
•In September 2023, AbbVie announced top-line results from the Phase 3 CANOVA study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Venclexta plus dexamethasone (VenDex) for patients with t(11;14)-positive relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma who have received two or more prior treatments. The data did not demonstrate that the treatment combination significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), the primary endpoint of the trial. Patients receiving VenDex showed improvement in median PFS with the combination of study comparator pomalidomide and dexamethasone (PomDex); however, the results did not reach statistical significance. The company plans to discuss the data with health authorities in the near future to further understand the potential of Venclexta as a biomarker-driven therapy in multiple myeloma.
Aesthetics
Juvederm Collection
•In May 2023, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Skinvive by Juvederm to improve skin smoothness of the cheeks in adults over the age of 21.
Botox Cosmetic
•In September 2023, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from the second of three Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating Botox Cosmetic for the treatment of moderate to severe platysma prominence associated with platysma muscle activity. All primary and secondary endpoints were met in the second Phase 3 study and results were consistent with findings from the first Phase 3 study. A Phase 3 open-label extension study is ongoing, with results expected later this year. The company plans to include data from the full Phase 3 study program as part of an upcoming FDA regulatory submission expected near the end of the year.
BoNT/E
•In October 2023, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating trenibotulinumtoxinE (BoNT/E) for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. All primary and secondary endpoints were met for both Phase 3 studies and results support BoNT/E as a novel botulinum neurotoxin serotype E characterized by a rapid onset of action as early as 8 hours after administration and short duration of effect within 2-3 weeks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased compared to the prior year due to the timing of working capital partially offset by decreased results of operations primarily driven by lower net revenues as well as higher payments for income taxes.Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included payments made for acquisitions and investments of $670 million and capital expenditures of $572 million. Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included payments made for acquisitions and investments of $494 million, capital expenditures of $482 million and net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $32 million.Financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included repayments of $1.0 billion floating rate term loan, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% senior notes and $350 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 2.80% senior notes.

The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by the increase in the quarterly dividend rate.
2023 Form 10-Q | 34


On September 8, 2023, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on October 13, 2023, payable on November 15, 2023. On October 26, 2023, the board of directors declared an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend from $1.48 per share to $1.55 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of January 16, 2024. This reflects an increase of approximately 4.7% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization. AbbVie repurchased 10 million shares for $1.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 8 million shares for $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
In March 2023, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit facility. The amendment increased the unsecured revolving credit facility commitments from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion and extended the maturity date of the facility from August 2023 to March 2028. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At September 30, 2023, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
Credit Ratings
In August 2023, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded AbbVie’s senior unsecured long-term credit rating to A3 with a stable outlook from Baa1 with a positive outlook and affirmed AbbVie’s Prime-2 short-term credit rating. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines, to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2023.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

Note 1    Basis of Presentation


Basis of Historical Presentation
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.It is management’s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and operating results. Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period interim condensed consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding this acquisition.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2016-13
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking "expected credit loss" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.Upon adoption of the standard, accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. There were no significant changes in credit loss risk factors that impacted the company's recorded allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
ASU No. 2019-12
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2021. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3    Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:
Three months endedSeptember 30, Nine months endedSeptember 30,(in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2020 2019Basic EPS        Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $2,308 $1,884 $4,580 $5,081Earnings allocated to participating securities 17 10 44 27Earnings available to common shareholders $2,291 $1,874 $4,536 $5,054Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,769 1,481 1,633 1,480Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $1.30 $1.27 $2.78 $3.41         Diluted EPS        Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $2,308 $1,884 $4,580 $5,081Earnings allocated to participating securities 17 10 44 27Earnings available to common shareholders $2,291 $1,874 $4,536 $5,054Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,769 1,481 1,633 1,480Effect of dilutive securities 5 2 4 3Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,774 1,483 1,637 1,483Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $1.29 $1.26 $2.77 $3.41
Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented.

(a)Represents cash consideration transferred of $120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing.(b)Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020 closing price of $83.96 per share.
(c)Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders.The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of September 30, 2020. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill, property and equipment, inventories and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:
(in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents$1,537Short-term investments1,421Accounts receivable2,423Inventories2,340Prepaid expenses and other current assets1,984Investments137Property and equipment1,912Intangible assets Developed product rights58,280In-process research and development1,040Other noncurrent assets1,452Short-term borrowings(60)Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations(1,899)Accounts payable and accrued liabilities(5,813)Long-term debt and finance lease obligations(18,937)Deferred income taxes(4,068)Other long-term liabilities(4,728)Total identifiable net assets37,021Goodwill27,063Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed$64,084
The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $1.2 billion is being amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be within approximately one year from the acquisition date.

2020 Form 10-Q | 10




Intangible assets relate to $58.3 billion of developed product rights and $1.0 billion of in-process research and development (IPR&D). The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 9 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the "income approach" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of products sold, research and development (R&D) costs, selling and marketing costs and contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt.Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through September 30, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $5.9 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $1.5 billion, inclusive of $2.6 billion of intangible asset amortization and $964 million of inventory fair value step-up amortization.Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $781 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and $26 million for the three months and $50 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and were included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. There were no acquisition-related expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020.
Pro Forma Financial Information
The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019:

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.
Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity
Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and $476 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Note 8    Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy
See Note 11 to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a summary of AbbVie's risk management policy and use of derivative instruments.
Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion at September 30, 2020 and $957 million at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2020 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $2.3 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $8.3 billion at September 30, 2020 and $7.1 billion at December 31, 2019.The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling €971 million, £204 million and CHF62 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The company also had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €7.3 billion at September 30, 2020 and €3.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.AbbVie is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $4.8 billion at September 30, 2020 and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Basis of fair value measurement(in millions)Total Quoted prices in active markets foridentical assets (Level 1) Significant other observableinputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)Assets       Cash and equivalents$39,924 $1,542 $38,382 $—Debt securities3 — 3 —Equity securities24 24 — —Interest rate swap contracts31 — 31 —Foreign currency contracts22 — 22 —Total assets$40,004 $1,566 $38,438 $—Liabilities       Interest rate swap contracts$76 $— $76 $—Foreign currency contracts56 — 56 —Contingent consideration7,340 — — 7,340Total liabilities$7,472 $— $132 $7,340
Equity securities consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of September 30, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:
RangeWeighted average(a)Discount rate0.2% - 2.6%1.5%Probability of payment for unachieved milestones16% - 57%54%Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)16% - 100%89%Projected year of payments2020 - 20342027
(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.
(b) Excludes early stage indications with 0% estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100% probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 16% to 56% at September 30, 2020.

AbbVie also holds investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $96 million as of September 30, 2020 and $66 million as of December 31, 2019. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of September 30, 2020.

Concentrations of Risk
Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 67% as of September 30, 2020 and 68% as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of AbbVie’s net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. Humira (adalimumab) is AbbVie’s single largest product and accounted for approximately 46% of AbbVie’s total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 58% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Debt and Credit Facilities
Allergan-Related Financing
In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, in May 2020, the company borrowed $3.0 billion under a $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement, of which $1.0 billion was outstanding under a floating rate three-year term loan tranche and $2.0 billion outstanding under a floating rate five-year term loan tranche as of September 30, 2020. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. In May 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash. Following the settlement of the exchange offers, AbbVie issued $14.0 billion and €3.1 billion of new notes in exchange for the Allergan notes tendered in the exchange offers. The aggregate principal amount of Allergan notes that remained outstanding following the settlement of the exchange offers was approximately $1.5 billion and €635 million. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of the assumed debt instruments. In September 2020, the company repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity.

Note 11 Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 6% for the three months and 5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 over the prior year was principally due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible Allergan acquisition related costs, the impact of changes in contingent consideration liabilities, collaboration related costs and changes in the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions.Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $138 million.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $70 million as of September 30, 2020 and $290 million as of December 31, 2019. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.
Antitrust Litigation
Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020, the court denied the end-payers' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In September 2014, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $448 million, plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTC’s request for injunctive relief. In September 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the district court’s finding of sham litigation with respect to one generic company and affirmed with respect to the other but held the FTC lacked authority to obtain a disgorgement remedy and vacated the district court’s award. The Third Circuit also affirmed the district court’s denial of the FTC’s injunction request and reinstated the FTC’s settlement-related claim for further proceedings in the district court.

In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. The court granted motions dismissing the claims of three plaintiffs, one of which refiled its lawsuit in New York state court in June 2020 while the appeal of its dismissal in Illinois is pending.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions.In February 2020, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Elfers v. Gonzalez, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties regarding alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value and in connection with the announcements of results of AbbVie’s 2018 Dutch auction tender offer.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
, “
.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain aesthetic products and devices are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 47,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment.
2020 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition to create a more diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across Allergan's therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing incremental debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $31.9 billion, operating earnings of $7.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.77 and cash flows from operations of $12.7 billion. Worldwide net revenues grew by 30% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis, which included $5.9 billion of contributed revenues from the Allergan acquisition, growth in the immunology portfolio from Skyrizi, Rinvoq and the continued strength of Humira in the U.S. as well as revenue growth from Imbruvica and Venclexta.Diluted earnings per share was $2.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and included the following after-tax costs:       (i) $3.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.6 billion of Allergan acquisition and integration expenses;        (iii) $1.1 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) $898 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); and (v) $202 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.

2020 Form 10-Q | 31




In October 2020, the company announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly rate.
Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. In June 2020, AbbVie announced that it entered into a collaboration with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic to prevent and treat COVID-19. Additionally, AbbVie donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity, supply critical equipment and deliver food and essential supplies during the crisis. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative therapies and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes approximately 80 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The Allergan acquisition added several early-to-late stage pipeline assets in key areas, such as aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and general medicine. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next 12 months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

n/m – Not meaningful(a)  Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 include product revenues for Allergan products only from May 8, 2020, which was the acquisition closing date, through September 30, 2020.The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie’s net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis.Global Humira sales increased 4% for the three months and 3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by market growth across all indications, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 8% for the three months and 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets.Net revenues for Skyrizi increased more than 100% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by market growth and market share gains over the prior year following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

2020 Form 10-Q | 36




Net revenues for Rinvoq increased more than 100% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by the August 2019 FDA approval and December 2019 EC approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie’s 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 9% for the three months and 15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of continued penetration of Imbruvica for patients with CLL, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Net revenues for Venclexta increased by 58% for the three months and 80% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML.Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics were $393 million for the three months and $619 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics were $274 million for the three months and $387 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas were $523 million for the three months and $820 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania were $358 million for the three months and $550 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of Allergan acquisition.Global Mavyret sales decreased by 41% for the three months and 40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by competitive dynamics in the U.S. and lower patient volumes in certain international markets, including lower global new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Net revenues for Creon increased by 6% for the three months and 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by continued market growth, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market with approximately 80% total market share.Net revenues for Lupron decreased by 41% for the three months and 14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to a near-term supply issue which has impacted product availability of certain formulations.

Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year. Gross margin percentage for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was unfavorably impacted by higher amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value step-up adjustments associated with the Allergan acquisition as well as collaboration profit sharing arrangements for Imbruvica and Venclexta.

SG&A expense percentage for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was unfavorably impacted by incremental SG&A expenses of Allergan, including transaction and integration costs resulting from the acquisition.

R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to the $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to terminate the Rova-T R&D program. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were also favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition.Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPR&D expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There were no other individually significant transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with the financing of the Allergan acquisition as well as the incremental Allergan debt acquired, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s debt obligations.Interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates.

2020 Form 10-Q | 38




Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $197 million for the three months and $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $180 million for the three months and $2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the change in fair value represented lower discount rates and the passage of time. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the change in fair value represented higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and declining interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program.

Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate was 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 6% for the three months and 5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 over the prior year was principally due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible Allergan acquisition related costs, the impact of changes in contingent consideration liabilities, collaboration related costs and changes in the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Nine months endedSeptember 30,(in millions)2020 2019Cash flows provided by (used in):   Operating activities$12,734 $10,049Investing activities(36,930) 1,211Financing activities(7,806) (7,894)
Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased compared to the prior year and included the results of Allergan subsequent to the May 8 acquisition date. Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and the timing of working capital cash flows, partially offset by acquisition-related cash expenses.Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion. Investing cash flows also included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.4 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $519 million. Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $476 million and capital expenditures of $389 million.Financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes at maturity and the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity. Financing cash flows nine months ended September 30, 2019 included the repayment of AbbVie's $3.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. In September 2019, the company also issued €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Cash dividend payments totaled $5.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in cash dividend payments was driven by an increase in the quarterly dividend rate. On September 11, 2020, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.18 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2020, payable on November 16, 2020. In October 2020, the company announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the

2020 Form 10-Q | 39




dividend payable in February 2021 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $500 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 4 million shares for $300 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019.During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.
Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. AbbVie has assessed credit risk in these countries and currently does not believe the economic conditions in these countries will have a significant impact on the company’s liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance of receivables outstanding as of September 30, 2020. AbbVie will continue to monitor information as it becomes available with respect to COVID-19 and evaluate any expected impact on the company’s receivables.
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At September 30, 2020, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
Credit Ratings
Following the acquisition of Allergan, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES


DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Changes in internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30, 2020, management is in the process of integrating the internal controls of the acquired Allergan business into AbbVie's existing operations as part of planned integration activities. There were no other changes in AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2020.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS


There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in AbbVie’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, except for the following:
Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), could adversely impact AbbVie's operations and financial condition.
Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could adversely impact AbbVie's operations and financial condition. In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was designated a global pandemic and many countries, including the United States, declared national emergencies and implemented preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders. The spread of COVID-19 has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie's employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie's employees, patients, customers and business partners.The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to-date has not been material, but over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, the outbreak could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition.

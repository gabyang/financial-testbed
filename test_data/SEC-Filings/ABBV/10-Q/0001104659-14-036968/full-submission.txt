AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)
 

Note 1    Background and Basis of Presentation

 
Background
 
The principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. Substantially all of AbbVies sales in the United States are to three wholesalers. Outside the U.S., products are sold primarily to health care providers or through distributors, depending on the market served.
 
On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbotts shareholders (the separation). On January 1, 2013, Abbotts shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 12, 2012 received one share of AbbVie common stock for every one share of Abbott common stock held as of the record date. AbbVies common stock began trading regular-way under the ticker symbol ABBV on the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.
 
In connection with the separation, AbbVie and Abbott entered into transition services agreements covering certain corporate support and back office services that AbbVie has historically received from Abbott. Such services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, engineering support, quality assurance support and other administrative services. These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing AbbVie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. Transition services may be provided for up to 24 months post-separation, with an option for a one-year extension.
 
During the first three months of 2014 and 2013, AbbVie incurred $80 million and $34 million of separation-related expenses, including legal, information technology and regulatory fees, which were principally classified in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A).
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AbbVie have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the companys audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.
 
It is managements opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the companys financial position and operating results. Net sales and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.

Table of Contents

For a certain portion of AbbVies operations, the legal transfer of AbbVies assets (net of liabilities) did not occur with the separation of AbbVie on January 1, 2013 due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and satisfy other regulatory requirements in certain countries. Under the terms of the separation agreement with Abbott, AbbVie is responsible for the business activities conducted by Abbott on its behalf, and is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. As a result, the related assets and liabilities and results of operations have been reported in AbbVies condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Net sales related to these operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 totaled approximately $67 million. At March 31, 2014, the assets and liabilities consisted primarily of accounts receivable of $68 million, inventories of $47 million, other assets of $63 million, and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $129 million. At December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities consisted primarily of accounts receivable of $62 million, inventories of $190 million, other assets of $93 million and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $212 million. The majority of these operations are expected to be transferred to AbbVie by the end of 2015.As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the aggregate amount due from Abbott totaled $540 million and $738 million, respectively, and was classified in accounts and other receivables, net, in the companys condensed consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate amount due to Abbott totaled $517 million and $876 million as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and was classified in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the companys condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Note 3    Earnings Per Share
AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, the two-class method was more dilutive. As such, the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs) for the three months ended March 31, 2014 of approximately 4 million shares was excluded from the denominator for the calculation of diluted EPS. These awards otherwise would have been included in the calculation of EPS under the treasury stock method. Additionally, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) allocable to participating securities, including performance-based awards not otherwise included in the calculation of EPS under the treasury stock method, was excluded from the numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method. Earnings allocable to participating securities for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $4 million.For the three months ended March 31, 2014, approximately 1 million common shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of earnings per common share assuming dilution because the effect would have been antidilutive.For the three months ended March 31, 2013, AbbVie determined the treasury stock method to be more dilutive. As a result, the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options as well as the dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and RSAs of approximately 6 million shares were reflected in the denominator for the calculation of diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
Note 4    Goodwill and Intangible Assets





Goodwill

The carrying amount of goodwill was $6,271 million and $6,277 million at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Changes in the goodwill balance were due to foreign currency translation. As of March 31, 2014, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Future impairment tests for goodwill will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if indicators of impairment exist.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense was $110 million and $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included in cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.The indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. There were no impairment charges recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. Future impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if indicators of impairment exist.


Note 5    Restructuring Plans

In 2013, AbbVie management approved plans to restructure certain commercial operations in conjunction with the loss and expected loss of exclusivity of certain products. Restructuring charges related to these plans were $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and were primarily recorded in SG&A in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.In 2012 and prior years, AbbVie management approved plans to realign its worldwide manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development (R&D) operations in order to reduce costs. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, AbbVie incurred restructuring charges of approximately $9 million for employee severance and contractual obligations, with $7 million classified in cost of products sold and $2 million as SG&A expenses.The following summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for the first three months of 2014.

Note 6    Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. The companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the companys judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps, based on judgment, to manage interest costs in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the companys outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required.

Financial Instruments

Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $2.7 billion and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2014 will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding twelve months.

Table of Contents

The company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, AbbVie held notional amounts of $6.3 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.AbbVie is a party to interest rate hedge contracts, designated as fair value hedges, totaling $8.0 billion at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie recorded the contracts at fair value and adjusted the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.The following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVies derivative instruments as of March 31, 2014.

The gain/(loss) related to fair value hedges is recognized in net interest expense and directly offsets the (loss)/gain on the underlying hedged item, the fixed-rate debt, resulting in no net impact to net interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.

Fair Value Measures

The fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair value measurements consists of the following three levels.·                  Level 1  Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;·                  Level 2  Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and·                  Level 3  Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the companys management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014.

The fair values for time deposits included in cash and equivalents and short-term investments are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis reflecting quoted market rates for the same or similar instruments. The fair values of time deposits approximate their amortized cost due to the short maturities of these instruments. Available-for-sale equity securities consists of investments for which the fair value is determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company are valued using publicized spot curves for interest rate hedges and publicized forward curves for foreign currency contracts. The contingent consideration is valued using a discounted cash flow technique that reflects managements expectations about probability of payment.Cumulative unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities totaled $2 million at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels. The following table is a reconciliation of the fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consist of contingent payments related to acquisitions and investments.

Investments consist of cost method investments and held-to-maturity debt securities. Cost method investments include certain investments for which the fair value is determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. To determine the fair value of other cost method investments, the company takes into consideration recent transactions, as well as the financial information of the investee, which represents a Level 3 basis of fair value measurement. The fair value of held-to-maturity debt securities was estimated based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments. The fair values of short-term and current borrowings approximate the carrying values due to the short maturities of these instruments.

The fair value of long-term debt, excluding fair value hedges, was determined by using the published market price for the debt instruments, without consideration of transaction costs, which represents a Level 1 basis of fair value measurement. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions.

Concentrations of Risk

The company invests excess cash in time deposits, money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. The company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with deposits with financial institutions. Credit exposure limits have been established to limit a concentration with any single issuer or institution.Three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 34 percent and 38 percent of total net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and substantially all of AbbVies U.S. sales are to these three wholesalers. In addition, net governmental receivables outstanding in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain totaled $566 million at March 31, 2014 and $781 million at December 31, 2013.HUMIRA is AbbVies single largest product and accounted for approximately 58 percent and 52 percent of AbbVies total net sales in the first three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.



Short-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2013, short-term borrowings included $400 million of commercial paper borrowings. No commercial paper balances were outstanding as of March 31, 2014. The weighted-average interest rate on the commercial paper was 0.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2014. No borrowings were outstanding under the $2.0 billion unsecured bank credit facility as of March 31, 2014.

Prior to separation, AbbVie employees participated in Abbotts incentive stock program. The AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program, adopted at the time of separation, facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbotts incentive stock program and authorizes the post-separation grant of several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSAs, RSUs and performance-based RSAs and RSUs.In connection with the separation, outstanding Abbott employee stock options, RSAs and RSUs previously issued under Abbotts incentive stock program were adjusted and converted into new Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards using a formula designed to preserve the intrinsic value and fair value of the awards immediately prior to the separation. Upon the separation on January 1, 2013, holders of Abbott stock options, RSAs and RSUs generally received one AbbVie stock-based award for each Abbott stock-based award outstanding. These adjusted awards retained the vesting schedule and expiration date of the original awards. No awards have been granted to Abbott employees other than in connection with the separation.

The fair value of RSAs and RSUs (including performance-based awards) is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the companys common stock on the date of the grant. The fair market value of RSAs and RSUs vested in the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was $314 million and $267 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2014, $280 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs and RSUs is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.

Cash Dividends

On February 20, 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per share, which represented an increase of 5 percent over the previous quarterly rate of $0.40 per share. The dividend is payable May 15, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2014. Additionally, the quarterly cash dividend declared by the board of directors on December 12, 2013 of $0.40 per share of common stock for stockholders of record on January 15, 2014 was paid on February 14, 2014.On January 4 and February 15, 2013, the board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.40 per share of common stock, which were paid on February 15 and May 15, 2013, respectively. The cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock declared on January 4, 2013 was declared from pre-separation earnings and was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.


Stock Repurchase Program

On February 15, 2013, AbbVies board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program. Purchases of AbbVie shares may be made from time to time at managements discretion depending on the companys cash flows, net debt level and market conditions. The plan has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, AbbVie repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $250 million in the open market. Shares repurchased under this program are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses, and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVies remaining share repurchase authorization is $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2014. There were no share repurchases in the first quarter of 2013.

Note 9    Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 23.8 percent and 21.9 percent in the first quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rates in both periods were less than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the benefit of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States and tax exemptions and incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions. The increase in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2014 over the prior year was principally due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.It is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, and the gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change up to $22 million. AbbVie and Abbott entered into a tax sharing agreement effective on the date of separation. For tax contingencies prior to the separation, Abbott will indemnify and hold AbbVie harmless if the tax positions are settled for amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, and AbbVie will not benefit if prior tax positions are resolved more favorably than recorded amounts.

Note 10  Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

 
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. AbbVie is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations, including those described below. The recorded accrual balance for litigation at March 31, 2014 was not significant. Within the next year, other legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all other proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVies consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
 
Lawsuits have been filed against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan® entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys fees. In September 2013, all of these pending putative class action lawsuits were centralized for consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Multi-District Litigation Rules as In re Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460.
 
In August 2013, a putative class action lawsuit, Sidney Hillman Health Center of Rochester, et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed against AbbVie in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by three healthcare benefit providers alleging violations of federal RICO statutes and state deceptive business practice and unjust enrichment laws in connection with reimbursements for certain uses of Depakote from 1998 to 2012. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and/or equitable relief and attorneys fees.
 
Several pending lawsuits filed against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi District Litigation Rules as In re AndroGel Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by private plaintiffs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), generally allege Solvays 2006 patent litigation involving AndroGel was sham litigation and the patent litigation settlement agreement and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys fees. MDL 2084 includes: (a) three individual plaintiff lawsuits; (b) seven purported class actions; and (c) Federal Trade Commission v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al., filed in May 2009 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Following the district courts dismissal of all plaintiffs claims, the FTCs appeal led to its claim regarding the patent litigation settlement being reinstated. In February 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit remanded the private plaintiffs claims regarding the patent litigation settlement, which are proceeding with the FTCs in discovery in the district court.
 
AbbVie is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to testosterone gel (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark AndroGel® 1.62%). In a case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in February 2013, AbbVie alleges that Perrigo Companys and Perrigo Israel Pharmaceutical Ltd.s proposed generic product infringes AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In a second case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2013, AbbVie alleges that Watson Laboratories Inc.s and Actavis Inc.s proposed generic product infringes AbbVies patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.

AbbVie is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ritonavir/lopinavir tablets (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Kaletra®). In a case filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in March 2009, AbbVie alleges that Matrix Laboratories, Inc.s, Matrix Laboratories, Ltd.s, and Mylan, Inc.s proposed generic products infringe AbbVies patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Upon Matrixs motion in November 2009, the court granted a five-year stay of the litigation unless good cause to lift the stay is shown.AbbVie is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ritonavir tablets (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Norvir®). In a case pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio since April 2012, AbbVie alleges that Roxane Laboratories, Inc.s (Roxane) proposed generic product infringes AbbVies patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In another case filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in July 2013, AbbVie alleges that Roxanes proposed generic ritonavir product infringes additional AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on these additional patents. In a separate case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in May 2013, AbbVie alleges that Hetero USA Inc.s and Hetero Labs Limiteds proposed generic ritonavir tablets product infringes AbbVies patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.AbbVie is seeking to enforce certain patent rights that cover the use of fully human anti-TNF alpha antibodies with methotrexate to treat rheumatoid arthritis. In a case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in May 2009, AbbVie alleges Centocor Ortho Biotech, Inc.s (now Janssen Biotech, Inc.s) product Simponi® infringes AbbVies patents and seeks damages and injunctive relief.In November 2007, GlaxoSmithKline filed a lawsuit against Abbott Laboratories in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Abbott violated antitrust laws in connection with the 2003 Norvir re-pricing. In March 2011, a jury found that Abbott did not violate antitrust laws, but breached its license agreement with the plaintiff. In January 2014, a 3-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed this verdict and remanded the case for a new trial due to the alleged improper exclusion of a potential juror. In March 2014, the Ninth Circuit instructed the parties to file briefs on whether the Ninth Circuit should rehear the case en banc. AbbVie assumed the liability for and control of certain legal matters, including this proceeding, in connection with its separation from Abbott.Note 11  Segment InformationAbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products. Substantially all of AbbVies U.S. sales are to three wholesalers. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to health care providers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Worldwide net sales of key products were as follows.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Company Overview

AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie develops and markets advanced therapies that address some of the worlds most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie products are used to treat chronic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohns disease; HIV; endometriosis; thyroid disease; Parkinsons disease; and complications associated with chronic kidney disease and cystic fibrosis, among other health conditions such as low testosterone. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines, including more than 20 compounds or indications in Phase II or Phase III development across such important medical specialties as immunology, virology, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases and womens health.In the United States, AbbVies products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 25,000 employees and its products are sold in over 170 countries. AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products.AbbVies long-term strategy is to maximize its existing portfolio of products through new indications, share gains, increased geographic expansion in underserved markets while also advancing its new product pipeline to meet unmet medical needs. To successfully execute its long-term strategy, AbbVie will focus on expanding HUMIRA sales, advancing the pipeline, expanding its presence in emerging markets and managing its product portfolio to maximize value.



Financial Results

Worldwide net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014 totaled $4.563 billion, an increase of 5 percent, driven primarily by the continued strength of HUMIRA and double-digit sales growth from key products including Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa. Growth in these key products was partially offset by the continuing impact of the loss of exclusivity in the companys lipid franchise in 2013. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, July 2013 for TRILIPIX and September 2013 for Niaspan, resulting in the loss of $248 million of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2014 over the prior year. The companys financial performance also included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $0.61, while increasing funding in support of AbbVies emerging mid-and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued support of additional HUMIRA indications. In the three months ended March 31, 2014, the company generated cash flows from operations of $624 million.

Research and Development

Research and innovation continues to be a key strategic priority for AbbVie. AbbVies long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVies pipeline includes more than 20 compounds or indications in Phase II or III development individually or under collaboration or license agreements. Of these programs, approximately 12 are in Phase III development or in registration. AbbVie expects several Phase II programs to transition into Phase III programs during 2014. Research and development (R&D) is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, virology, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases, and womens health, among others.

Table of Contents

During the first quarter of 2014, AbbVie continued to execute on its long-term strategy of advancing its new product pipeline and maximizing its existing portfolio through new indications and formulations. Significant recent developments in R&D included the following:·                  AbbVie recently submitted its U.S. regulatory application for its interferon-free combination for patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV). AbbVie plans to submit applications for regulatory approval of its regimen in the European Union in early May 2014. The company expects U.S. commercialization in 2014 and European approval in early 2015.·                  AbbVie announced the initiation of a global Phase III clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of its investigational compound, veliparib (ABT-888), in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, AbbVie initiated a Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of veliparib when added to carboplatin, a chemotherapy, in women with early-stage, triple negative breast cancer.·                  AbbVie initiated a Phase III evaluation for its next generation Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-199, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in collaboration with AbbVies development partner, Roche Holding AG.·                  AbbVie announced the initiation of a Phase III clinical trial that will evaluate the use of HUMIRA as a treatment for fingernail psoriasis in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.·                  AbbVie discontinued its Phase IIb study for the use of ABT-719 for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with major cardiac and vascular surgeries.·                  The company received a complete response letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with respect to the companys levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of Parkinsons disease. The letter principally related to the use of the delivery system, and did not identify safety issues or request additional clinical trials. This product is sold under the name Duodopa outside the United States.For a more comprehensive discussion of AbbVies products and pipeline, refer to the companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior years foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.Sales growth in the three months ended March 31, 2014 was driven by the continued strength of HUMIRA, both in the United States and internationally as well as sales growth in key products including Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa. Sales increased in the quarter despite the continued decline in AbbVies lipid franchise due to the loss of exclusivity and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

On a constant currency basis, global HUMIRA sales increased 18 percent primarily as a result of continued market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies, higher market share and higher pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales continued to expand across therapeutic categories. Internationally, growth is driven by the continued uptake of new indications, increased market share and market growth in most key countries. AbbVie is pursuing several new indications to help further differentiate from competitive products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA.Sales for Synagis increased 9 percent in the first quarter of 2014 reflecting seasonal demand. Synagis is a seasonal product with the majority of sales occuring in the first and fourth quarters.AndroGel sales in the first quarter of 2014 increased 6 percent, benefitting from a favorable comparison versus 2013. While AndroGel continues to gain market share, the overall U.S. testosterone replacement market is experiencing a decline. AndroGel 1% sales are expected to be impacted by generic competition in early 2015.Global sales of Kaletra declined in the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of competition.

Sales of Creon continued to grow in the first quarter of 2014. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market and continues to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. In the first quarter of 2013, the U.S. FDA approved a new dosage strength of Creon 36,000 lipase-unit capsules for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.Sales of Duodopa, AbbVies therapy for advanced Parkinsons disease currently approved in Europe and other international markets, increased 29 percent on a constant currency basis. Duodopa is currently under regulatory review in the United States and a regulatory decision is expected in 2014.Sales for AbbVies consolidated lipid franchise, which includes TriCor, TRILIPIX and Niaspan, declined 72 percent in the first quarter of 2014 due to the introduction of generic versions of these products in the U.S. market. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, in July 2013 for TRILIPIX, and in September 2013 for Niaspan.

The increases in SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2014 were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new, including preparations for the expected launch of AbbVies interferon-free HCV combination, and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net, which was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income, was $65 million and $66 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Income Tax Expense

The effective income tax rates were 23.8 percent and 21.9 percent in the first quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rates in both periods were less than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 percent principally due to the benefit of lower statutory tax rates and tax exemptions in certain foreign jurisdictions. The increase in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2014 over the prior year was primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.AbbVie expects that its effective income tax rate in 2014 will be approximately 22 percent, excluding any discrete items.


Transition from Abbott and Cost to Operate as an Independent Company

On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbotts shareholders (the separation). Prior to the separation, Abbott provided AbbVie certain services, which included administration of treasury, payroll, employee compensation and benefits, travel and meeting services, public and investor relations, real estate services, internal audit, telecommunications, information technology, corporate income tax and selected legal services. Some of these services continue to be provided to AbbVie on a temporary basis after the separation pursuant to certain transition services agreements with Abbott. As a result, AbbVie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company, including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions, incremental information technology-related costs, and incremental costs to operate a stand-alone back office infrastructure outside the United States.AbbVies transition services agreements with Abbott in the United States cover certain corporate support services that AbbVie has historically received from Abbott. Such services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, and other financial functions, as well as engineering support for various facilities, quality assurance support, and other administrative services. The terms of the services under the agreements vary by activity. These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing AbbVie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization.As of the date of the separation, AbbVie did not have sufficient back office infrastructure to operate in markets outside the United States. As a result, AbbVie entered into transition services agreements with Abbott to provide services outside the United States, including back office services in certain countries, for up to two years after separation. The back office services provided include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, and other administrative services. These transition services agreements have allowed AbbVie to operate its international pharmaceuticals business independently prior to establishing a stand-alone back office infrastructure for all countries. During the transition from Abbott, AbbVie has and will continue to incur non-recurring expenses to expand its international infrastructure. In addition, in certain international markets as of the date of the separation and as of March 31, 2014, certain marketing authorizations to sell AbbVies products continued to be held by Abbott until such authorizations could be transferred through the applicable regulatory channels.

Cash flows provided by operations for the first three months of 2014 was $624 million compared to $1,187 million for the first three months of 2013. Cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2014 and 2013 includes voluntary contributions to the companys main domestic defined benefit plan of $370 million and $145 million, respectively.Cash flows from investing activities for the three months ended 2014 and 2013 reflected capital expenditures and net sales (purchases) of short-term investments.During the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013 was $400 million. No commercial paper borrowings were outstanding at March 31, 2014. The weighted-average interest rates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.The companys cash and equivalents and short-term investments decreased from $9,895 million at December 31, 2013 to $9,100 million at March 31, 2014. While a significant portion of cash and equivalents at March 31, 2014 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, AbbVie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. If these funds were needed for operations in the United States, AbbVie would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds. AbbVie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at March 31, 2014 has been reinvested indefinitely.Dividends of $641 million were paid on February 14, 2014 to stockholders of record on January 15, 2014 at $0.40 per share. On February 20, 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per share for stockholders of record on April 15, 2014, payable on May 15, 2014. The timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVies financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVies debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. Cash dividends paid in the first quarter of 2013 were $636 million.In February 2013, AbbVies board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion common stock repurchase program, which was effective immediately. Purchases of AbbVie shares may be made from time to time at managements discretion. The plan has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the company repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $250 million in the open market. As of March 31, 2014, approximately $1 billion remained available under the February 2013 authorization. There were no share repurchases in the first quarter of 2013.Substantially all of AbbVies trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are with governmental health systems. AbbVie continues to monitor the economic health of the economy in Southern Europe, as heightened economic concerns still exist. Outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows.

AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables. Currently, AbbVie does not believe the economic conditions in Southern Europe will have a material impact on the companys liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility.
 
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
 
Credit Facility
 
AbbVie currently has a $2.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which also supports commercial paper borrowings. The credit facility enables the company to borrow funds at floating interest rates. At March 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility are not material. There were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
Access to Capital
 
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt. The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives.
 
Credit Ratings
 
On March 4, 2014, Moodys affirmed its rating of Baa1 and revised its ratings outlook to positive from stable. There were no other changes in the companys credit ratings in the first three months of 2014. Refer to the 2013 Annual Report for further discussion of the companys credit ratings.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. A summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. There have been no significant changes in the companys application of its critical accounting polices during the first three months of 2014.

Forward-Looking Statements

Some statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may be forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words believe, expect, anticipate, project and similar expressions, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, challenges to intellectual property, competition from other products, difficulties inherent in the research and development process, adverse litigation or government action, and changes to laws and regulations applicable to our industry. Additional information about the economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect AbbVies operations is set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in AbbVies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AbbVie notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures. Refer to Note 6 entitled Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies.

Foreign Currency Risk

AbbVies primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party, generally not exceeding twelve months. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, AbbVie held $2.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in notional amounts of such contracts.AbbVie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. The contracts, which are not designated as hedges, are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, AbbVie held notional amounts of $6.3 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

The company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $901 million at March 31, 2014. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contacts. A 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange.Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require AbbVie to obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government. Effective February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3, which resulted in a loss of $11 million in the first quarter of 2013 recorded in net foreign exchange loss on the condensed consolidated statement of earnings.


Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate swaps are used to manage the companys exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. AbbVie does not use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities. At both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, AbbVie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $8.0 billion. The company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100-basis points would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately $395 million at March 31, 2014. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100-basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $831 million at March 31, 2014. A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates.

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES


Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, William J. Chase, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVies disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVies disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AbbVies management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Changes in internal control over financial reporting. As part of its separation from Abbott, AbbVie began a phased global implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, related technology infrastructure and transaction processing services to replace the information technology infrastructure and transactional services provided to AbbVie by Abbott under various transition services agreements. These initiatives, which are expected to be completed in 2015, will include modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting. AbbVie reviews these controls for design effectiveness prior to the implementation of each phase.There were no other changes in AbbVies internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2014.

Table of Contents

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVies management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

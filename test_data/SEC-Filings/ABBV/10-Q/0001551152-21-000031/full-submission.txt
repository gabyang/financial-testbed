Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period interim condensed consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2019-12
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3 Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:
Three months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,(in millions, except per share data)2021202020212020Basic EPSNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.$3,179 $2,308 $7,498 $4,580 Earnings allocated to participating securities21 17 53 44 Earnings available to common shareholders$3,158 $2,291 $7,445 $4,536 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding1,770 1,769 1,769 1,633 Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1.78 $1.30 $4.21 $2.78 Diluted EPSNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.$3,179 $2,308 $7,498 $4,580 Earnings allocated to participating securities21 17 53 44 Earnings available to common shareholders$3,158 $2,291 $7,445 $4,536 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding1,770 1,769 1,769 1,633 Effect of dilutive securities7 5 7 4 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding1,777 1,774 1,776 1,637 Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1.78 $1.29 $4.19 $2.77
Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented.

Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements


Acquisition of Allergan
On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The combination created a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline were enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure.

2021 Form 10-Q | 7


The acquisition of Allergan was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included: (i) an increase to intangible assets of $710 million; (ii) an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of $148 million; (iii) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net increase to identifiable net assets of $2 million; and (iv) a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $564 million. The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from the completion of the valuation of certain license agreement intangible assets based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and would not have had a significant impact on prior period results if these adjustments had been made as of the acquisition date.
Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity
Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $837 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. AbbVie recorded acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $390 million for the three months and $557 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and recorded acquired IPR&D charges of $45 million for the three months and $898 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Soliton, Inc.
In May 2021, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with Soliton, Inc. (Soliton) to acquire Soliton and RESONIC, its Rapid Acoustic Pulse device which recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance and is a non-invasive treatment for the short-term improvement in the appearance of cellulite. Under the terms of the transaction agreement, AbbVie will pay $22.60 per share in cash for each outstanding share of Soliton for an enterprise value of approximately $550 million. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
Calico Life Sciences LLC
In July 2021, AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) entered into an extension of their collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. This is the second collaboration extension and builds on the partnership established in 2014 and extended in 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie and Calico will each contribute an additional $500 million and the term is extended for an additional three years. AbbVie’s contribution is payable in two equal installments beginning in 2023. Calico will be responsible for research and early development until 2025 and will advance collaboration projects into Phase 2a through 2030. Following completion of the Phase 2a studies, AbbVie will have the option to exclusively license the collaboration compounds. Upon exercise, AbbVie would be responsible for late-stage development and commercial activities. Collaboration costs and profits will be shared equally by both parties post option exercise. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, AbbVie recorded $500 million as other operating expense in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings related to its commitments under the agreement.
TeneoOne and TNB-383B
In September 2021, AbbVie acquired TeneoOne, an affiliate of Teneobio, Inc., and TNB-383B, a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). In February 2019, AbbVie and TeneoOne entered a strategic transaction to develop and commercialize TNB-383B, a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets BCMA and CD3 and is designed to direct the body's own immune system to target and kill BCMA-expressing tumor cells. AbbVie exercised its exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne and TNB-383B based on an interim analysis of an ongoing Phase 1 study and accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an exercise payment of $400 million which was recorded to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The agreement also included additional payments of up to $250 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones.
REGENXBIO Inc.
In September 2021, AbbVie and REGENXBIO Inc. (REGENXBIO) entered into a partnership to develop and commercialize RGX-314, an investigational gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. Under the collaboration, REGENXBIO will be responsible for completion of the ongoing trials of RGX-314. AbbVie and REGENXBIO will collaborate and share costs on additional trials of RGX-314. AbbVie will lead the clinical development and commercialization of RGX-314 globally. REGENXBIO and AbbVie will share equally in pre-tax profits from net revenues of RGX-314 in the U.S. AbbVie will pay REGENXBIO tiered royalties on net revenues outside the U.S. Upon closing, AbbVie will make an upfront payment of $370 million

which will be recorded to IPR&D in the consolidated statement of earnings. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval. The agreement also included additional payments of up to $1.4 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones.
Genmab A/S
In June 2020, AbbVie and Genmab A/S (Genmab) entered into a collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize three of Genmab's early-stage investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics and entered into a discovery research collaboration for future differentiated antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Genmab granted to AbbVie an exclusive license to its epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20), DuoHexaBody-CD37 and DuoBody-CD3x5T4 programs. For epcoritamab, the companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, with AbbVie responsible for further global commercialization. Genmab will record net revenues in the U.S. and Japan, and the parties will share equally in pre-tax profits from these sales. Genmab will receive tiered royalties on remaining global sales. For the discovery research partnership, Genmab will conduct Phase 1 studies for these programs and AbbVie retains the right to opt-in to program development. AbbVie made an upfront payment of $750 million, which was recorded to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The agreement also included additional payments of up to $3.2 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones for all programs.

Note 7 Integration and Restructuring Plans

Allergan Integration Plan
Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.

Note 8 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy
See Note 11 to the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a summary of AbbVie’s risk management policy and use of derivative instruments.
Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2021 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. The company is party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion at September 30, 2021 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $8.1 billion at September 30, 2021 and $8.6 billion at December 31, 2020.
2021 Form 10-Q | 12


The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling €4.3 billion at September 30, 2021 and €971 million at December 31, 2020. The company also had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €5.9 billion at September 30, 2021 and €6.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.The company is party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $3.8 billion at September 30, 2021 and $4.8 billion December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Fair Value Measures
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:•Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;•Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and•Level 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Equity securities consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is
2021 Form 10-Q | 15


employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of September 30, 2021 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:
RangeWeighted average(a)Discount rate0.1% - 2.6%1.5 %Probability of payment for unachieved milestones56% - 92%87 %Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)56% - 100%95 %Projected year of payments2021 - 20342027
(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.
(b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56% to 89% at September 30, 2021.
There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of total contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs:

The company also repaid $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity in May 2021.In September 2021, the company refinanced its $1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $1.0 billion term loan due May 2023 and borrowed $1.0 billion under a new term loan at a lower floating rate. All other significant terms of the loan, including the maturity date, remained unchanged after the refinancing.In September 2021, the company repaid $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in December 2021. This repayment was made by exercising, under the terms of the notes, 90-day early redemption at 100% of the principal amount.In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, in May 2020, the company borrowed $3.0 billion under a $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement, consisting of a $1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan tranche and a $2.0 billion floating rate five-year term loan tranche. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. In May 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash. Following the settlement of the exchange offers, AbbVie issued $14.0 billion and €3.1 billion of new notes in exchange for the Allergan notes tendered in the exchange offers. The aggregate principal amount of Allergan notes that remained outstanding following the settlement of the exchange offers was approximately $1.5 billion and €635 million. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of the assumed debt instruments. In September 2020, the company repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity.In May 2020, the company also repaid $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior notes at maturity.

Other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $726 million and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling a loss of $455 million, which were principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets.

Note 11 Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 14% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and collaborations. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 over the prior year was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings resulting from collaboration activities and accretion on contingent consideration in 2021.
Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $258 million.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.
Antitrust Litigation
Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payors. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020 and August 2021, the court denied the end-payors' motions to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In September 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $448 million, plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTC’s request for injunctive relief. In September 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the district court’s finding of sham litigation with respect to one generic company and affirmed with respect to the other but held the FTC lacked authority to obtain a disgorgement remedy and vacated the district court’s award. The Third Circuit also affirmed the district court’s denial of the FTC’s injunction request and reinstated the FTC’s settlement-related claim for further proceedings in the district court. In July 2021, the FTC voluntarily dismissed the remaining claims in its lawsuit with prejudice.In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also making allegations similar to those in FTC v. AbbVie Inc. (above). In May 2020, Perrigo Company and related entities filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, making sham litigation allegations similar to those in FTC v. AbbVie Inc. (above). In October 2020, the Perrigo lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for New Jersey. In September 2021, the New Jersey court granted AbbVie’s motion for judgment on the pleadings in the Perrigo lawsuit, dismissing it with prejudice.Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect Humira purchasers, alleging that AbbVie’s settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVie’s Humira patent portfolio violated state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation. In June 2020, the court dismissed the consolidated litigation with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.
2021 Form 10-Q | 21


Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Namenda, are consolidated as In re: Namenda Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.Lawsuits are pending against Allergan Inc. generally alleging that Allergan’s petitioning to the U.S. Patent Office and Food and Drug Administration and other conduct by Allergan involving Restasis violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, certified as a class action filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of Restasis, are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the MDL Rules as In re: Restasis (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion) Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2819. In May 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter that is subject to court approval.Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, are consolidated as In re: Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Government Proceedings
Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and other defendants generally alleging that they improperly marketed and/or distributed prescription opioid products. Approximately 3,200 matters are pending against Allergan. The federal court cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804. Approximately 300 of the claims are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these cases, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals, and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al., in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act. In October 2020, the state added a claim under the New Mexico False Advertising Act.
Shareholder and Securities Litigation
In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. The court granted motions dismissing the claims of three investment-fund plaintiffs, which they appealed. In March 2021, in the first of those appeals, the dismissal was affirmed. One of these plaintiffs refiled its lawsuit in New York state court in June 2020 while the appeal of its dismissal in Illinois is pending. In November 2020, the New York Supreme Court for the County of New York dismissed that lawsuit, which is being appealed. In September 2021, the Illinois court granted AbbVie’s motion for summary judgment against all remaining plaintiffs on all the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissals.In October 2018, a federal securities purported class action lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class.Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants. The lawsuits, which were filed by Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities Litigation. The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to dismiss. In September 2020, the court denied plaintiffs’ class certification motion because it found the lead plaintiff to be an inadequate representative of the proposed class but allowed another putative class member to propose itself as a new lead plaintiff. In December 2020, the court appointed a new lead plaintiff. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class.
2021 Form 10-Q | 22


Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan’s former Actavis generics unit and its alleged anticompetitive conduct with other generic drug companies. The lawsuits were filed by Allergan shareholders and consist of three purported class actions and one individual action seeking monetary damages and attorney’s fees that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey as In re: Allergan Generic Drug Pricing Securities Litigation. In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits, which is pending court approval.
Product Liability and General Litigation
In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit.
Intellectual Property Litigation
AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd are seeking to enforce their patent rights relating to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Humira). In April 2021 and May 2021, cases were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Alvotech hf. AbbVie alleges defendant’s proposed biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In August 2021, the court denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds in the first case; a motion in the second case remains pending. The court has set a trial on a subset of patents for August 2022. The court order provides that Alvotech will stay off the market until that decision. Litigation on the remaining patents is stayed. In May 2021, Alvotech hf. and its U.S. subsidiary Alvotech USA, Inc. filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States Eastern District of Virginia seeking a declaration that the same patents at issue in AbbVie’s April 2021 Illinois case are invalid or not infringed. AbbVie has filed a motion to dismiss or transfer that case to the Northern District of Illinois. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). Cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 against Alvogen Pine Brook LLC and Natco Pharma Ltd. In August 2021, the court issued a decision holding all asserted patents infringed and valid. The judgment precludes Defendants from obtaining regulatory approval and launching until the last patent expires in 2036. On August 30, 2021, Defendants appealed. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in these suits.
Allergan USA, Inc., Allergan Sales, LLC, and Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries of AbbVie, are seeking to enforce patent rights relating to cariprazine (a drug sold under the trademark Vraylar). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2019 against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun Pharma Global FZE; Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc.; and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Limited. Allergan alleges defendants' proposed generic cariprazine products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Gedeon Richter Plc, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Allergan concerning the development and marketing of Vraylar, is the co-plaintiff in this suit.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan created a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline was enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain aesthetic products and devices are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 50,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment.
2021 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition to create a more diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across Allergan's therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $41.3 billion, operating earnings of $12.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $4.19 and cash flows from operations of $17.7 billion. Worldwide net revenues grew by 29% on a reported basis and 28% on a constant currency basis, which included $13.0 billion of contributed revenues from the Allergan acquisition, growth in the immunology portfolio from Skyrizi, Rinvoq and the continued strength of Humira in the U.S. as well as revenue growth from Venclexta and Imbruvica.Diluted earnings per share was $4.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and included the following after-tax costs:      (i) $4.9 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.4 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $543 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (iv) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC; (v) $427 million of Allergan acquisition and integration expenses; (vi) $307 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses; and (vii) $86 million for charges related to litigation matters. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.
2021 Form 10-Q | 26


Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize more than $2 billion of annual cost synergies over a three-year period, with approximately 50% realized in R&D, 40% in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and 10% in cost of products sold. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.
Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
In response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace. AbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the availability and successful administration of effective vaccines.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes more than 80 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Interest income decreased for nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to prior year primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates.Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $98 million for the three months and $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and $197 million for the three months and $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the change in fair value represented the passage of time partially offset by higher discount rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the change in fair value represented higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable Skyrizi clinical results and the passage of time. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the change in fair value represented lower discount rates and the passage of time.

Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate was 14% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and collaborations. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 over the prior year was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings resulting from collaboration activities and accretion on contingent consideration in 2021.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Nine months endedSeptember 30,(in millions)20212020Cash flows provided by (used in):Operating activities$17,702 $12,734 Investing activities(1,199)(36,930)Financing activities(12,701)(7,806)
Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased compared to the prior year. Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and lower acquisition-related cash expenses, partially offset by the timing of working capital cash flows and higher income tax payments.Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $837 million, capital expenditures of $600 million and net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $15 million. Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.4 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $519 million.Financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company’s 2.3% senior notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company’s 5.0% senior notes and €750 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 0.5% senior euro notes. Financing cash flows also included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity in May 2021. Financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes at maturity and the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity.Cash dividend payments totaled $6.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and $5.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020 as well as an increase in the quarterly

dividend rate. On September 10, 2021, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2021, payable on November 15, 2021. On October 29, 2021, the company announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company’s quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of January 14, 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie repurchased 5 million shares for $550 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 6 million shares for $500 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At September 30, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
Credit Ratings
There were no changes in the company’s credit ratings during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2021.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

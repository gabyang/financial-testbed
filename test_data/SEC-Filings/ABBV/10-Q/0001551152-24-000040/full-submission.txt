Note 3 Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:

Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements


Proposed Acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.
Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 28, 2024, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aliada Therapeutics, Inc. (Aliada) including its lead program ALIA-1758. ALIA-1758 is an anti-pyroglutamate amyloid beta (3pE-Aβ) antibody in development for the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will make an upfront cash payment of approximately $1.4 billion to acquire all outstanding equity of Aliada. Closing of the proposed transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.
On August 1, 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics. Cerevel Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of differentiated therapies for neuroscience diseases. Cerevel Therapeutics neuroscience pipeline includes multiple clinical-stage and preclinical candidates with the potential to treat several diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and mood disorders. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie acquired all outstanding shares of Cerevel Therapeutics for $45.00 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred to owners of Cerevel Therapeutics common stock was $8.7 billion ($8.3 billion, net of cash acquired).The acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of September 30, 2024. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:
(in millions)Assets acquired and liabilities assumedCash and equivalents$361 Short-term investments382 Prepaid expenses and other current assets9 Property and equipment, net25 Investments121 Intangible assets, net8,100 Other noncurrent assets31 Current portion of long-term debt(400)Accounts payable and accrued liabilities(100)Long-term debt(246)Deferred income taxes(1,292)Other long-term liabilities(31)Total identifiable net assets6,960 Goodwill1,702 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed$8,662
Intangible assets relate to $8.1 billion of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the "income approach" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.
2024 Form 10-Q | 9


The current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie consists of $345 million aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $400 million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Long-term debt assumed by AbbVie relates to funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $246 million as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the financing liability was determined using a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for sales milestones and royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Assumptions inherent in the development of fair value include discount rates, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving milestones and estimated amounts of future sales. See Note 8 for additional information.Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics represents expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie’s neuroscience pipeline, (ii) leverage AbbVie’s commercial, regulatory and clinical expertise to maximize Cerevel Therapeutic’s assets and (iii) enhance AbbVie’s existing neuroscience discovery capabilities. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.AbbVie also assumed a licensing agreement entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) prior to the acquisition. Under the agreement, Cerevel Therapeutics was granted an exclusive global license under certain Pfizer patent rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds included in Cerevel Therapeutic’s pipeline. AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $1.6 billion upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones for all programs. Additionally, AbbVie will pay tiered royalties on net revenues.Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Cerevel Therapeutics have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through September 30, 2024, operating losses attributable to Cerevel Therapeutics were $299 million, inclusive of $161 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for Cerevel Therapeutics employee incentive awards. AbbVie also issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of Cerevel Therapeutics equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
Acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc.
On February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of ImmunoGen. ImmunoGen is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for cancer patients. ImmunoGen's oncology portfolio includes its flagship cancer therapy Elahere, a first-in-class ADC approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and a pipeline of promising next-generation ADC's targeting hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The combination accelerates AbbVie’s entry into the solid tumor space and strengthens its oncology pipeline. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie acquired all outstanding shares of ImmunoGen for $31.26 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred to owners of ImmunoGen common stock was $9.8 billion ($9.2 billion, net of cash acquired).The acquisition of ImmunoGen has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of September 30, 2024. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date.

The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $179 million is being amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be within approximately one year from the acquisition date.Intangible assets relate to $7.3 billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $1.3 billion of acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 12 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the "income approach" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.Other noncurrent assets primarily consist of $250 million of deferred tax assets. The current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie was repaid concurrent with the acquisition at the fair value of $99 million. See Note 8 for additional information.Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of ImmunoGen represents expected synergies including, the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie’s product portfolio as well as the potential to increase revenue from future growth platforms, (ii) accelerate AbbVie’s clinical and commercial presence in the solid tumor space within oncology, (iii) leverage the respective strengths of each company, and (iv) enhance AbbVie’s existing ADC development efforts. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.Following the acquisition date, the operating results of ImmunoGen have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through September 30, 2024, net revenues attributable to ImmunoGen were $396 million and operating losses attributable to ImmunoGen were $582 million, inclusive of $349 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards, $158 million of inventory fair value step-up amortization and $113 million of intangible asset amortization. AbbVie also issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant.

Collaborations

The company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.
In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
The increase in definite-lived intangible assets during 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of ImmunoGen. The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the acquisitions.Amortization expense was $1.9 billion for the three months and $5.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $2.0 billion for the three months and $6.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization expense was included in cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.In August 2023, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the company’s oncology product Imbruvica sold in the United States (U.S.) was included on the list of products selected for negotiation by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The selection resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of $1.9 billion, which was lower than the carrying value of $4.0 billion and resulted in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount as of August 29, 2023. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.1 billion to cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statement
2024 Form 10-Q | 14


of earnings for the third quarter of 2023. The fair value measurement was based on Level 3 inputs including estimated net revenues, cost of products sold, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and discount rate.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. The increase in indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2024 was primarily due to the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the acquisitions.
During the first quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to revise the research and development plan for AGN-151607, a novel investigational neurotoxin for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiac surgery patients. This decision contributed to a delay in the estimated timing of regulatory approval as well as a significant decrease in estimated future cash flows of the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value which was below the carrying value of the intangible asset. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $630 million to research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the first quarter of 2023.

Note 7 Restructuring Plans

AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges were $30 million for the three months and $94 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $10 million for the three months and $55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These charges are recorded in cost of products sold, R&D expense and SG&A expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees or the related operations.
The following table summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Allergan Integration Plan
Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and incurred total cumulative charges of $2.5 billion through December 31, 2023. These costs consisted of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. The Allergan integration plan was substantially complete as of December 31, 2023 and the remaining accrual as of September 30, 2024 is not significant.

Note 8 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy
See Note 11 to the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a summary of AbbVie’s risk management policy and use of derivative instruments.
Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $2.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2024 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in AOCI. This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. In June 2023, the company entered into a cross-currency swap contract that matured in November 2023 with a notional amount totaling €433 million to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in future cash flows of foreign currency denominated debt related to changes in foreign exchange rates. The cross-currency swap contract was designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively converted the interest and principal payments of the related foreign currency denominated debt to U.S. dollars. The unrealized gains and losses on the contract were included in AOCI and reclassified to net foreign exchange loss over the term of the related debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $7.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2023.The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €3.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and €5.4 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling €6.2 billion, SEK1.9 billion, CAD750 million and CHF70 million at September 30, 2024 and €4.9 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD750 million and CHF50 million at December 31, 2023. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Fair Value Measures
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:•Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;•Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and•Level 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024:

Money market funds and time deposits are valued using relevant observable market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets and interest rate curves. Equity securities primarily consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market prices per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The financing liability is related to funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition and assumed by AbbVie. The funding agreements represent financial instruments that are accounted for as financing arrangements and the company elected to account for the financing liability in accordance with the fair value option, as permitted under ASC 825 Financial Instruments. The fair value measurement of the financing liability was determined based on significant unobservable inputs. Potential payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for sales milestones and royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the financing liability can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving milestones and estimated amounts of future sales. The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense (income), net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and the change in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive loss. Changes in fair value recognized in other expense (income), net and other comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were not significant.    The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
2024 Form 10-Q | 19


The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:

(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.
(b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment was 89% at December 31, 2023.
There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of total contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs:

The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense (income), net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Contingent consideration payments of amounts up to the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from financing activities and payments of amounts in excess of the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

Note 11 Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 25% for the three months and 28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9% for the three months and 20% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and business development activities, including ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisition-related costs. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year was primarily due to changes in fair value of contingent consideration, impact of foreign operations and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year was primarily due to the impact of foreign operations and business development activities.
It is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $58 million in connection with statute of limitation expirations. The company has various federal, state and foreign examinations ongoing. Finalizing examinations with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and as a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of resolution for certain unrecognized tax benefits.Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the company was notified that the administrative proceeding related to its U.S. federal income tax examination for certain tax years was substantially completed. Final resolution of examination of such years may occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company anticipates that final resolution will result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and recognition of an income tax benefit in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings, which could be material. The Company does not anticipate that such resolution will have a significant impact on its cash flows.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.
Antitrust Litigation
Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of six individual plaintiff lawsuits and a certified class action by Niaspan direct purchasers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the federal multi-district litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. In September 2024, AbbVie and plaintiffs reached an agreement to resolve this lawsuit. In November 2022, the State of Oregon filed a lawsuit in the Multnomah County, Oregon Circuit Court making similar allegations regarding the 2011 patent litigation with one of the generic companies.
Government Proceedings
Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid products. Approximately 440 lawsuits are pending against Allergan in federal and state courts. Most of the federal court lawsuits are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804. Approximately 35 of the lawsuits are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Of these approximately 440 lawsuits, approximately 30 of them are brought by states, counties, cities, and other municipal entities, approximately 10 of which are in the process of being dismissed pursuant to the previously announced settlement. Another approximately 45 of the approximately 440 lawsuits are covered by a proposed class settlement between Allergan and a class of acute care hospitals, which is subject to court approval and other contingencies.In March 2023, AbbVie Inc. filed a petition in the United States Tax Court, AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The petition disputes the Internal Revenue Service determination concerning a $572 million income tax benefit recorded in 2014 related to a payment made to a third party for the termination of a proposed business combination.

AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2018 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.In May and July 2022, two shareholder derivative lawsuits, Treppel Family Trust v. Gonzalez et al., and Katcher v.

In October 2024, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss without prejudice.
Product Liability and General Litigation
In April 2023, a putative class action lawsuit, Camargo v. AbbVie Inc., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of Humira patients who paid for Humira based on its list price or who, after losing insurance coverage, discontinued Humira because they could not pay based on its list price, alleging that Humira’s list price is excessive in violation of multiple states’ unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes. The plaintiff generally seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees.In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator sought damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In March 2023, the court granted Allergan’s motion to dismiss, dismissing plaintiff-relator’s federal law claims with prejudice and state law claims without prejudice. The plaintiff-relator is appealing the court’s motion to dismiss ruling.Lawsuits are pending against various Allergan entities in the United States and other countries including Brazil, Canada, South Korea, and the Netherlands, in which plaintiffs generally allege that they developed, or may develop, breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or other injuries from Allergan’s Biocell® textured breast implants, which were voluntarily withdrawn from worldwide markets in 2019. Approximately 130 ALCL lawsuits and 1,000 other lawsuits are coordinated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the MDL rules as In re: Allergan Biocell Textured Breast Implant Product Liability Litigation, MDL No. 2921.

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.On August 1, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics). The acquisition complements AbbVie’s neuroscience portfolio, adding a wide range of potentially best-in-class assets that may transform standards of care across psychiatric and neurological disorders where significant unmet needs remain for patients. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Cerevel Therapeutics.On July 1, 2024, AbbVie announced Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's former president and chief operating officer, succeeded Richard A. Gonzalez as the company's chief executive officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since the company's formation in 2013, retired from the role of CEO and became executive chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of directors effective July 1, 2024.On February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). The acquisition of ImmunoGen further builds on AbbVie's existing solid tumor pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AbbVie and ImmunoGen's combined capabilities represent an opportunity to deliver potentially transformative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies to patients. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of ImmunoGen.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees.
2024 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $41.2 billion, operating earnings of $10.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.41 and cash flows from operations of $11.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis.Diluted earnings per share was $2.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and included the following after-tax costs:                     (i) $4.9 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $3.4 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $894 million of acquisition and integration expenses; and (iv) $585 million for charges related to litigation matters. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental interest associated with financing the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt issued to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions.Interest income decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance. Interest income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and the impact of higher interest rates.Other expense (income), net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $1.4 billion for the three months and $3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $8 million for the three months and $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the change in fair value also reflected the impact of lower discount rates. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the change in fair value reflected the passage of time offset by higher discount rates. For the nine months

ended September 30, 2023, the change in fair value reflected higher Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates.

Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate was 25% for the three months and 28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9% for the three months and 20% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and business development activities, including ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisition-related costs. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year was primarily due to changes in fair value of contingent consideration, impact of foreign operations and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year was primarily due to the impact of foreign operations and business development activities.Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the company was notified that the administrative proceeding related to its U.S. federal income tax examination for certain tax years was substantially completed. Final resolution of examination of such years may occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company anticipates that final resolution will result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and recognition of an income tax benefit in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings, which could be material. The Company does not anticipate that such resolution will have a significant impact on its cash flows.

Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of working capital, higher contingent consideration payments classified as operating cash flows and decreased results from operations driven by ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisition-related cash expenses.Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included $18.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics offset by cash acquired of $952 million, net sales and maturities of investment securities of $470 million, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.2 billion and capital expenditures of $683 million. Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $670 million and capital expenditures of $572 million.Financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the issuance of unsecured senior notes totaling $15.0 billion aggregate principal which were used to finance the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. Additionally, financing cash flows included the issuance and repayment of $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement and repayments of €1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.38% senior euro notes, €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% senior euro notes, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes, $99 million of secured term notes assumed from ImmunoGen in conjunction with the acquisition and the settlement of $400 million aggregate amount of 2.5% convertible senior notes assumed from Cerevel Therapeutics.

Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the company refinanced its $2.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $2.0 billion term loan due May 2025 and borrowed $2.0 billion under a new term loan due April 2027. Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $8.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $7.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by the increase in the quarterly dividend rate.
2024 Form 10-Q | 40


On September 6, 2024, the company announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.55 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2024, payable on November 15, 2024. On October 30, 2024, the board of directors declared an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend from $1.55 per share to $1.64 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 14, 2025 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2025. This reflects an increase of approximately 5.8% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization. AbbVie repurchased 5 million shares for $959 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 10 million shares for $1.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.Financing cash flows also included contingent consideration payments of $735 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no contingent consideration payments classified as financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company issued and redeemed $1.7 billion of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.
Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.
Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
In December 2023, in connection with the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, AbbVie entered into a $9.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and $5.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement. In February, 2024, AbbVie borrowed and repaid $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement. Subsequent to the $15.0 billion issuance of senior notes, AbbVie terminated both the bridge and term loan credit agreements in the first quarter of 2024. In March 2023, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit facility. The amendment increased the unsecured revolving credit facility commitments from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion and extended the maturity date of the facility from August 2023 to March 2028. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At September 30, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
2024 Form 10-Q | 41


Credit Ratings
In August 2024, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) affirmed its A3 senior unsecured long-term rating. At the same time, Moody’s revised its outlook to positive from stable. There were no other changes in the company’s credit ratings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Some statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are, or may be considered, forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” and similar expressions and uses of future or conditional verbs, generally identify forward-looking statements. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to challenges to intellectual property, competition from other products, difficulties inherent in the research and development process, adverse litigation or government action and changes to laws and regulations applicable to our industry. Additional information about the economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect AbbVie’s operations is set forth in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in AbbVie’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AbbVie notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines, to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Michael, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or
2024 Form 10-Q | 42


that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

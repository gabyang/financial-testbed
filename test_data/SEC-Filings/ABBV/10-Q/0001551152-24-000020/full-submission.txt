Note 3 Earnings Per Share

AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:
Three months endedMarch 31,(in millions, except per share data)20242023Basic EPSNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1,369 $239 Earnings allocated to participating securities10 11 Earnings available to common shareholders$1,359 $228 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding1,769 1,770 Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.$0.77 $0.13 Diluted EPSNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.$1,369 $239 Earnings allocated to participating securities10 11 Earnings available to common shareholders$1,359 $228 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding1,769 1,770 Effect of dilutive securities4 6 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding1,773 1,776 Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.$0.77 $0.13
Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented.

Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements


Acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc.
On February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of ImmunoGen. ImmunoGen is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for cancer patients. ImmunoGen's oncology portfolio includes its flagship cancer therapy Elahere, a first-in-class ADC approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and a pipeline of promising next-generation ADC's targeting hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The combination accelerates AbbVie’s entry into the solid tumor space and strengthens its oncology pipeline. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie acquired all outstanding shares of ImmunoGen for $31.26 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred to owners of ImmunoGen common stock was $9.8 billion ($9.2 billion, net of cash acquired).The acquisition of ImmunoGen has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of March 31, 2024. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:
(in millions)Assets acquired and liabilities assumedCash and equivalents$591 Accounts receivable171 Inventories211 Prepaid expenses and other current assets40 Property and equipment, net7 Intangible assets, netDeveloped product rights7,200 License agreements125 Acquired in-process research and development1,280 Other noncurrent assets273 Current portion of long-term debt(99)Accounts payable and accrued liabilities(312)Deferred income taxes(899)Other long-term liabilities(47)Total identifiable net assets8,541 Goodwill1,249 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed$9,790
The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $179 million is being amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be within approximately one year from the acquisition date.Intangible assets relate to $7.3 billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $1.3 billion of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 12 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the "income approach" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.
2024 Form 10-Q | 9


Other noncurrent assets primarily consist of $250 million of deferred tax assets. The current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie was repaid concurrent with the acquisition at the fair value of $99 million. See Note 8 for additional information.Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of ImmunoGen represents expected synergies including, the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie’s product portfolio as well as the potential to increase revenue from future growth platforms, (ii) accelerate AbbVie’s clinical and commercial presence in the solid tumor space within oncology, (iii) leverage the respective strengths of each company, and (iv) enhance AbbVie’s existing ADC development efforts. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.Following the acquisition date, the operating results of ImmunoGen have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through March 31, 2024, net revenues attributable to ImmunoGen were $91 million and operating losses attributable to ImmunoGen were $404 million, inclusive of $349 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards, $47 million of inventory fair value step-up amortization and $21 million of intangible asset amortization. AbbVie also issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to the issued RSUs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was not significant. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and were included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
Pro Forma Financial Information
The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and ImmunoGen for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 as if the acquisition of ImmunoGen had occurred on January 1, 2023:

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and ImmunoGen. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2023 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.
Proposed Acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
The increase in definite-lived intangible assets during 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of ImmunoGen. The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding the acquisition.Amortization expense was $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Amortization expense was included in cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. The increase in indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of ImmunoGen. Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding the acquisition.
During the first quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to revise the research and development plan for AGN-151607, a novel investigational neurotoxin for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiac surgery patients. This decision contributed to a delay in the estimated timing of regulatory approval as well as a significant decrease in estimated future cash flows of the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value which was below the carrying value of the intangible asset. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $630 million to research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the first quarter of 2023.

Note 7 Restructuring Plans

AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges were $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These charges are recorded in cost of products sold, R&D expense and SG&A expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees or the related operations.

Note 8 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Risk Management Policy
See Note 11 to the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a summary of AbbVie’s risk management policy and use of derivative instruments.
Financial Instruments
Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.1 billion at March 31, 2024 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2024 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.In 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in AOCI. This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt.
2024 Form 10-Q | 14


The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $6.2 billion at March 31, 2024 and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2023.The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €5.4 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling €4.9 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD750 million and CHF50 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $5.0 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

Fair Value Measures
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:•Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;•Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and•Level 3 – Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Money market funds and time deposits are valued using relevant observable market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets and interest rate curves. Equity securities primarily consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market prices per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is
2024 Form 10-Q | 17


employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.
The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:
March 31, 2024December 31, 2023RangeWeighted average(a)RangeWeighted average(a)Discount rate4.6% - 5.8%4.8%4.3%- 5.9%4.5%Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)89% - 100%99%89% - 100%99%Projected year of payments2024 - 203420302024 - 2034 2027
(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.
(b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment was 89% at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of total contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs:

The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Contingent consideration payments of amounts up to the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from financing activities and payments of amounts in excess of the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

AbbVie also holds investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $161 million as of March 31, 2024 and $159 million as of December 31, 2023. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of March 31, 2024.
Concentrations of Risk
Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 79% as of March 31, 2024 and 81% as of December 31, 2023, and substantially all of AbbVie’s pharmaceutical product net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers.
Debt and Credit Facilities
Financing Related to ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics Acquisitions
In connection with the acquisition of ImmunoGen and proposed acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, in February, 2024, the company issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. The notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of AbbVie and will rank equally in right of payment with all of AbbVie’s existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fixed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $99 million and debt discounts totaled $37 million, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.AbbVie used the net proceeds received from the issuance of the notes to finance the acquisition of ImmunoGen, repay its term-loan, repay commercial paper borrowings, pay fees and expenses in respect of the foregoing, finance general corporate purposes and expects, together with cash on hand, to fund AbbVie’s proposed acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics. See Note 4 for additional information.

The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and business development activities, including ImmunoGen acquisition-related costs. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 over the prior year was primarily due to changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairment of certain intangible assets in the prior year.
It is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $162 million. The company has various federal, state and foreign examinations ongoing. Finalizing examinations with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and as a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of resolution for certain unrecognized tax benefits.

Note 12 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies

AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.

Shareholder and Securities Litigation
In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2018 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions.

The plaintiff-relator sought damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In March 2023, the court granted Allergan’s motion to dismiss, dismissing plaintiff-relator’s federal law claims with prejudice and state law claims without prejudice. The plaintiff-relator is appealing the court’s motion to dismiss ruling.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Company Overview
AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.On February 20, 2024, AbbVie announced Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's current president and chief operating officer, will succeed Richard A. Gonzalez as the company's chief executive officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since the company's formation in 2013, will retire from the role of CEO and become executive chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of directors effective July 1, 2024.On February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). The acquisition of ImmunoGen further builds on AbbVie's existing solid tumor pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AbbVie and ImmunoGen's combined capabilities represent an opportunity to deliver potentially transformative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies to patients. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of ImmunoGen.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees.
2024 Strategic Objectives
AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

Financial Results
The company's financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $12.3 billion, operating earnings of $2.8 billion, diluted earnings per share of $0.77 and cash flows from operations of $4.0 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis.Diluted earnings per share was $0.77 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and included the following after-tax costs:              (i) $1.6 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $643 million for the change in fair value of contingent
2024 Form 10-Q | 28


consideration liabilities; and (iii) $486 million of acquisition and integration expenses. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.

Research and Development
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company’s operations and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. Gross margin percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was unfavorably impacted by changes in product mix, offset by lower amortization of intangibles.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. SG&A expense percentage was unfavorably impacted by acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with the ImmunoGen acquisition including cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards. See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Interest expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental interest and debt issuance costs associated with financing the ImmunoGen and proposed Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions as well as the impact of higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to debt issued to finance the ImmunoGen acquisition.Interest income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and the impact of higher interest rates.Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $660 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time, lower discount rates and favorable clinical trial results.

Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate was 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 49% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and business development activities, including ImmunoGen acquisition-related costs. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 over the prior year was primarily due to changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairment of certain intangible assets in the prior year.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Three months endedMarch 31,(in millions)20242023Cash flows provided by (used in):Operating activities$4,040 $4,193 Investing activities(9,588)(499)Financing activities10,819 (6,192)
Operating cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to ImmunoGen acquisition-related cash expenses, decreased results from operations driven by changes in product mix and increased R&D funding to support all stages of the company’s pipeline assets, partially offset by the timing of working capital.Investing cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily included $9.8 billion cash consideration paid to acquire ImmunoGen offset by cash acquired of $591 million, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $190 million and capital expenditures of $193 million. Investing cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $353 million and capital expenditures of $175 million.Financing cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included the issuance of unsecured senior notes totaling $15.0 billion aggregate principal which were used to finance the acquisition of ImmunoGen and proposed acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics. Additionally, financing cash flows included the issuance and repayment of $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement and the repayment of $99 million of secured term notes assumed from ImmunoGen in conjunction with the acquisition. Financing cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included repayments of $1.0 billion floating rate term loan and $350 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 2.80% senior notes. Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $2.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by the increase in the quarterly dividend rate.On February 15, 2024, the company announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.55 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2024, payable on May 15, 2024. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie’s debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization. AbbVie repurchased 5 million shares for $959 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 10 million shares for $1.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023.During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the company issued and redeemed $1.7 billion of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.
Credit Risk
AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.

Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Credit Facility
In December 2023, in connection with the acquisition of ImmunoGen and proposed acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, AbbVie entered into a $9.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and $5.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement. In February, 2024, AbbVie borrowed and repaid $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement. Subsequent to the $15.0 billion issuance of senior notes, AbbVie terminated both the bridge and term loan credit agreements in the first quarter of 2024. In March 2023, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit facility. The amendment increased the unsecured revolving credit facility commitments from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion and extended the maturity date of the facility from August 2023 to March 2028. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At March 31, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Access to Capital
The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.
Credit Ratings
There were no changes in the company’s credit ratings during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in the company’s application of its critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2024.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are, or may be considered, forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” and similar expressions and use of future or conditional verbs, generally identify forward-looking statements. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to challenges to intellectual property, competition from other products, difficulties inherent in the research and development process, adverse litigation or government action and changes to laws and regulations applicable to our industry. Additional information about the economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect AbbVie’s operations is set forth in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in AbbVie’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AbbVie notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. AbbVie’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

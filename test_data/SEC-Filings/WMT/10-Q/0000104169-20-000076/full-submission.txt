Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Walmart" or the "Company") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included.  Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020").  Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during the month of October related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns.  Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.  Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.
Receivables
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for credit losses, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions.

Note 2.  Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:

Table of Contents
Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income for derivative instruments are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant.

Note 4.  Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt
The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program.  In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion.  In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, all undrawn.
The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2020:

Note 5.  Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:•Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.The Company measures the fair value of equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The fair value of the Company's equity investments recorded in other long-term assets are as follows:
(Amounts in millions)Fair Value as of October 31, 2020Fair Value as of January 31, 2020Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs$5,987 $2,715 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs6,782 2,723 Total$12,769 $5,438
Derivatives
The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value.  Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves.  As of October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.  The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2020.  Refer to Note 6 for additional information regarding the sale of Walmart Argentina.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, are as follows:
October 31, 2020January 31, 2020(Amounts in millions)Carrying ValueFair ValueCarrying ValueFair ValueLong-term debt, including amounts due within one year$45,207 $55,257 $49,076 $57,769

In October 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and announced the proposed divestiture of Asda Group Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Asda”), for an enterprise value of £6.8 billion, or approximately $9.1 billion based on current exchange rates.  Due to uncertainty of the macro-economic environment and a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which is uncertain, the held for sale criteria for the disposal group was not met as of October 31, 2020, and accordingly no impacts have been reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Walmart Argentina
In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and classified the disposal group as held for sale as of October 31, 2020 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.0 billion during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group.
Seiyu
In November 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell a majority stake in Seiyu, the Company's retail business in Japan, for an enterprise value of ¥172.5 billion, or approximately $1.7 billion based on current exchange rates.  As the disposal group met the held for sale criteria subsequent to October 31, 2020, the Company will recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $2.0 billion, after tax, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.  This estimate may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates and customary purchase price adjustments up to the closing date of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and is subject to regulatory approvals.

Note 7.  Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings.  The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made.  However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed.  The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores Ltd., an Asda subsidiary, is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value ("Equal Value") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future.  The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in July 2020. The Company is awaiting a decision.Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.
Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters
In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.

Note 8.  Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale, eCommerce websites and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.

The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.  Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacy transactions and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability.
Net sales by segment are as follows:

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview
This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2020, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020.We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.  Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs  by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period.  Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales.  We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally and those initiated through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs.  Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent.  Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation.  We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently.  Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Consistent with our strategy to further position our Walmart International portfolio enabling long-term, sustainable and profitable growth, we have taken the following actions:•In October 2020, we agreed to sell Asda Group Limited ("Asda”) for an enterprise value of £6.8 billion, or approximately $9.1 billion based on current exchange rates. When the disposal group meets the held for sale criteria, we expect to recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $5.5 billion, after tax, which includes the estimated loss on sale as well as the loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan.  This loss may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates and customary purchase price adjustments.  The loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan will be recognized at the earlier of either the disposal group meeting the held for sale criteria or the pension buy-out. We expect the impact of removing Asda from our Walmart International segment to dilute earnings per share by $0.25 in the first full year following completion of the transaction reflecting the absence of net income from Asda.  Refer to Note 6.•In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and classified the disposal group as held for sale as of October 31, 2020 in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  As a result, we recorded a non-cash loss of $1.0 billion, after-tax, during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses.  Refer to Note 6.•In November 2020, we agreed to sell a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail business in Japan, for an enterprise value of ¥172.5 billion, or approximately $1.7 billion based on current exchange rates.  As the disposal group met the held for sale criteria subsequent to October 31, 2020, we will recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $2.0 billion, after tax, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.  This estimate may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates and customary purchase price adjustments up to the closing date of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and is subject to regulatory approvals.  Refer to Note 6. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses.  Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence.  We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates").  We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events and global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.  Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "Item 5. Other Information."

COVID-19 Updates
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture, become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. These areas of focus are fundamental in running our business every day, and even more so now as Walmart plays an important role during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Throughout fiscal 2021, we have operated with a clear set of priorities to guide our decision making through the COVID-19 pandemic.  These priorities are:•Supporting our associates on the front lines in terms of their physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being. We are providing extra pay and benefits, including $1.3 billion to date in special cash bonuses to field associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy.  •Serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating.  We reduced our store operating hours at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and have since expanded store hours slightly during the third quarter. •Helping others which includes waiving or discounting rent for in-store tenants in April and May 2020 as well as hiring more than 500,000 new associates. •Managing the business well both operationally and financially and driving our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price discipline while investing in our omni-channel offering which continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.While we incurred incremental costs associated with operating during a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in overall net sales growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 with strong comparable sales in the U.S. and the majority of our international markets.  Sales trends were positively impacted by eCommerce growth acceleration as well as customers consolidating shopping trips and purchasing larger baskets.  For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations" below.We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; the length and impact of any stay–at–home orders or government mandates; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which will impact our results in the short term.


Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:•strong, efficient growth;•consistent operating discipline; and•strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.  The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand and overall net sales growth through the first three quarters of fiscal 2021.  As our Company continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized our focus on associate care, including extra pay and benefits as well as masks and gloves; increased cleaning and sanitation measures; customer safety; and new associate hiring.  Additionally, we've shifted the timing of certain capital spending and consulting projects, and reduced marketing and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs.  At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.  Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.  As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases.  Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:
Three Months Ended October 31,Nine Months Ended October 31, 20202019202020192020201920202019 With FuelFuel ImpactWith FuelFuel ImpactWalmart U.S.6.6 %3.3 %(0.1)%0.0 %8.9 %3.1 %(0.2)%0.0 %Sam's Club8.3 %0.6 %(3.3)%0.1 %8.9 %1.3 %(3.8)%0.6 %Total U.S.6.8 %2.9 %(0.6)%0.0 %8.9 %2.8 %(0.7)%0.0 %
Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 6.8% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 6.6% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips.  Beginning in mid-September, we began seeing improvement in transactions as store hours were slightly expanded. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.6% and 5.2% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 8.3% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively.  The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales.  The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% and 2.0% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively.

Consistent Operating Discipline
We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.  We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs.  We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.

For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 18 and 12 basis points, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 were strong sales and lapping a non-cash impairment charge in the prior year, partially offset by $0.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also impacted by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Strategic Capital Allocation
Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. In recent years, we have allocated more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. We will continue to remain disciplined with our capital spending in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Total capital expenditures for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S.; the following table provides additional detail:
(Amounts in millions)Nine Months Ended October 31,Allocation of Capital Expenditures20212020eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other$3,316 $3,859 Store remodels1,531 1,855 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations64 67 Total U.S.4,911 5,781 Walmart International1,527 1,984 Total Capital Expenditures$6,438 $7,765


Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time.  We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics.  In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets.  While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  ROA was 8.2% and 6.3% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily driven by the change in fair value of our equity investments, partially offset by the loss on sale of Walmart Argentina.  ROI was flat at 13.7% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2019, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8.  A two-point average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.  Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of $22.9 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, which increased when compared to $14.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments.  We generated free cash flow of $16.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, which increased when compared to $6.8 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.3 billion in decreased capital expenditures due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $6.7 billion or 5.2% and $24.8 billion or 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  These increases in revenue were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from strong demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets.  Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.1 billion and $4.8 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively.  At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mix of sales shifted initially toward food and consumables as consumers initiated stock-up trips.  As the pandemic continued into the second and third quarter, sales in food and consumables have remained strong while we saw increased demand in several general merchandise categories, due in part to stimulus dollars in the U.S. during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.  U.S. eCommerce sales remained strong throughout the year as more customers gravitated toward convenience and continued using pickup and delivery and our eCommerce websites.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate") increased 50 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, which was partially offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 increased 16 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase in the gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher-margin categories, and fewer markdowns.  This was partially offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 18 and 12 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year primarily due to strong sales and lapping a non-cash impairment charge in the prior year, partially offset by $0.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also impacted by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Other gains and losses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 consisted of a gain of $1.9 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, which primarily reflects the respective $2.7 billion and $6.0 billion fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $1.0 billion loss on sale of Walmart Argentina, which was classified as held for sale as of October 31, 2020. For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019, other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $0.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, primarily representing the fair value change of our JD.com investment.Our effective income tax rate was 26.9% and 25.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, which increased 284 and 125 basis points, respectively, as compared to 24.1% and 24.5% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to the loss on sale of Walmart Argentina recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $1.9 billion and $4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.80 and $5.48 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, which represents an increase of $0.65 and $1.74 when compared to the same periods, respectively, in the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $5.2 billion or 6.2% and $21.6 billion or 8.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were due to comparable sales of 6.6% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Customers continued to consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets which contributed to the growth in average ticket while transactions decreased.  With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.6% and 5.2% to comparable sales during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Gross profit rate increased 33 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, partially offset by the carryover of prior year price investment.  Gross profit rate decreased 12 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to carryover of prior year price investment as well the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns.Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 9 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to $0.4 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included additional costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, expanded cleaning practices, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 13 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $2.3 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses in the first and second quarter, the incremental COVID-19 costs described above, as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy.As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion and $1.0 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $0.4 billion or 1.3% for the three months ended October 31, 2020  when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.1 billion.Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $0.6 billion or 0.7% for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.8 billion, which was partially offset by positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced significant economic pressures, and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets.  While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter. Gross profit rate increased 90 and 56 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 73 and 8 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The decreases were primarily due to lapping a $0.3 billion non-cash impairment charge in the previous fiscal year as well as the current period impact of a twelve-month property tax abatement in the U.K. and were partially offset by $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively.As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

(1)   We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.2 billion or 8.3% and $3.9 billion or 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.3% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively.  Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% and 2.0% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. Gross profit rate increased 79 and 69 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to higher fuel margins, reduced tobacco sales, and improvements in inventory losses.  The increase in gross profit rate for the three months ended October 31, 2020 was partially offset by higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.  The increase in gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.    Membership and other income increased 7.9% and 5.8% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 were due to increases in overall renewal rates, new member sign-ups and Plus penetration rate primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increase in net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 30 and 31 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were primarily the result of $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, which included additional costs such as special bonuses for club associates in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021, expanded security and cleaning practices, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves.  Additionally, the increases in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales were affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Nine Months Ended October 31,(Amounts in millions)20202019Net cash provided by operating activities$22,880 $14,539
Net cash provided by operating activities was $22.9 billion and $14.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit
Cash and cash equivalents were $14.3 billion and $8.6 billion at October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  We maintained more cash at October 31, 2020 compared to October 31, 2019 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our working capital deficit was $14.5 billion at October 31, 2020, which decreased when compared to $15.9 billion at October 31, 2019.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.  Of the $3.4 billion at October 31, 2020, approximately $1.4 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Nine Months Ended October 31,(Amounts in millions)20212020Net cash used in investing activities $(6,507)$(6,285)
Net cash used in investing activities was $6.5 billion and $6.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Nine Months Ended October 31,(Amounts in millions)20202019Net cash used in financing activities$(11,340)$(7,213)
Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.  Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities was $11.3 billion and $7.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a reduction in share repurchases as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment.   In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion.  In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2020, all undrawn.
Long-term Debt
The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2020:

Dividends
On February 18, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share.  For fiscal 2021, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:
Record Date  Payable DateMarch 20, 2020  April 6, 2020May 8, 2020  June 1, 2020August 14, 2020  September 8, 2020December 11, 2020  January 4, 2021
The dividend installments payable on April 6, 2020, June 1, 2020, and September 8, 2020 were paid as scheduled.
Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2020 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  As of October 31, 2020, authorization for $4.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We continue to review our share repurchase activity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.  We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019:

Capital Resources
We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets.  We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn.  At October 31, 2020, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Rating agency  Commercial paper  Long-term debtStandard & Poor's  A-1+  AAMoody's Investors Service  P-1  Aa2Fitch Ratings  F1+  AA
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Other Matters
In Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," we discuss, under the sub-caption "ASDA Equal Value Claims," certain existing employment claims against Asda including certain risks arising therefrom.  In that Note 7, we also discuss, under the sub-caption "Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters," the Prescription Opiate Litigation and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom.  We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the ASDA Equal Value Claims, and the Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal Proceedings," under the sub-caption "I. Supplemental Information."  The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments.  Our market risks at October 31, 2020 are similar to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.  The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020, under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," in Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings."  We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought.  We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); and ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal).Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of November 19, 2020; some cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending.  A trial previously scheduled to begin on November 9, 2020 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid distribution claims has been postponed and no new trial date has been set.  A trial is currently scheduled to begin in the MDL in May 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims.  There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma.  In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of November 19, 2020, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state court cases and other information are included on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q.  On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act.  Walmart Inc. v. DOJ, et al. is pending before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. The Company has also been responding to civil investigative demands from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program. Due to the investigative stage of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to recent SEC amendments to this item, the Company will be using a threshold of $1 million for such proceedings. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.  The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions have had wide-ranging effects on our business and the global economy and have exacerbated the potential for certain risks identified in that disclosure, including, without limitation, risks related to the successful execution of our omni-channel strategy, operational risks associated with geo-political and catastrophic events, risks associated with our suppliers, reputational risks and risk associated with changes in and failure to comply with laws and regulations, to materially and adversely affect our financial performance.  The financial impact to the Company of the COVID-19 pandemic during the nine month period ended October 31, 2020, as well as certain of the actions we have taken to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers, members and the communities we serve, are discussed in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  Given the uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect in the U.S and the other markets we serve, there can be no assurance that the pandemic will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in the future.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2020, were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  As of October 31, 2020, authorization for $4.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock.  Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2020, was as follows:

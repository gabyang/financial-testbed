Walmart Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Walmart" or the "Company") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included.  Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019").  Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during the month of April related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns.  Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $37 million and $34 million as of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively, and was primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $300 million as of April 30, 2018 and January 31, 2018, respectively, and was primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories
At April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet.  The Company adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases.  For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of operating lease obligations at adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $15.1 billion increase to total liabilities as of April 30, 2019. The Company recognized $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores.  Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial amounts.  Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion, net of tax, which primarily consisted of the recognition of impairment.  The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were immaterially impacted.  Updated accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below.  Note 10 provides additional lease disclosures.For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease.  The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.  The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components.  For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.

Revenue Recognition
Contract Balances
Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers:
(Amounts in millions) April 30, 2019 January 31, 2019Assets:     Receivables from transactions with customers, net $2,566 $2,538     Liabilities:     Deferred gift card revenue $1,899 $1,932
Derivatives
In fiscal 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.  The adoption of the standard had no current or historical impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company continues to use qualitative methods to assess the effectiveness of its designated hedging relationships.  Upon adopting ASU 2017-12, the Company modified its existing hedge documentation to use a quantitative method for assessing effectiveness when the hedge is subsequently determined to be ineffective under the qualitative method.  There were no other significant changes to the Company's accounting policies for derivatives.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments.  The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020.  Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.


Note 2.  Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.  The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:

Note 5.  Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:•Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.The Company has equity investments, primarily its investment in JD.com, Inc. ("JD"), measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:•The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, and•The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operations in China, measured using Level 2 inputs.  Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Information for the fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows:
(Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of April 30, 2019 Fair Value as of January 31, 2019Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs $2,181 $1,791Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs 2,185 1,792Total $4,366 $3,583
The changes in fair value for the Company's investment in JD is included in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also holds derivative instruments.  Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest yield and foreign currency forward curves.  As of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis are required as a result of impairment charges or business acquisitions.  The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of April 30, 2019 or January 31, 2019, respectively.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, are as follows:

Note 6.  Derivative Financial Instruments
In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $209 million and $220 million at April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively.  Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties.  The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at April 30, 2019 or January 31, 2019, respectively. At April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, the Company had ¥180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion at April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom.  These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039.
The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Note 7.  Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings.  The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made.  However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed.  The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 30,000 equal value ("Equal Value") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future.  The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.  As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.In March 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form.  In July 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests.  Following additional proceedings, in June 2017 the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of Asda on the "strike out" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. In October 2018, claimants appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals and in January 2019, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the Tribunal’s procedural rule.As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, in October 2016 following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.  In August 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also granted permission for Asda to appeal substantially all of its findings.  Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals and a hearing before the Court of Appeals on the comparability findings was held in October 2018. The Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunal’s findings.  Asda sought permission to appeal the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court on February 27, 2019 and is awaiting a decision on its application. Claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims.  That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings.  The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.
National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.

FCPA Investigation and Related Matters
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company.  The Audit Committee and the Company engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who assisted in the investigation of these matters.The Company also conducted a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and, as part of that review, strengthened and enhanced its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company identified or were made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.  When such allegations were reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third-party advisors, conducted inquiries and investigations.  Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were conducted in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates or has operated, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India.As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA.  The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters.  These discussions progressed to a point that, in fiscal 2018, the Company reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the "Accrual").  While the Company believes the final resolution of these matters is nearing a conclusion, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters.A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters.  Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of the Company's shareholders against Walmart, certain current and former directors and former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers.  These matters have been resolved.Existing lawsuits relating to the allegations have been resolved, but the Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above.  There could be one or more enforcement actions or lawsuits in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties.  The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in conducting the investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred.  For the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters:
Three Months Ended April 30,(Amounts in millions) 2019 2018Ongoing inquiries and investigations $2 $4Global compliance program and organizational enhancements 2 3Total $4 $7
The Company does not presently believe that these matters, including the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future.

Note 8.  Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items
The following disposals, acquisitions and related items pertain to the Company's Walmart International segment.  Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or have been announced.
Walmart Brazil
In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent"). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters.  Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $250 million in contingent consideration.  As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income.  In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company indemnified Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting.  This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying value.
Flipkart
In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion.  The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy.  The purchase price allocation, which is still preliminary primarily due to certain tax items, is as follows:•Assets of $24.1 billion, which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible assets and $13.5 billion in goodwill.  Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs.  The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years.  The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;•Liabilities of $3.7 billion, which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.8 billion of deferred income taxes; and•Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion, for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs.
Asda
In April 2019, the Company announced the termination of a previously announced merger agreement that would have provided for the combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited, the Company's U.K. subsidiary.  As the proposed transaction had not yet met the held for sale criteria, the announcement of its termination had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 9.  Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil until the sale of the majority stake discussed in Note 8.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.Net sales by segment are as follows:

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview
This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 ("fiscal ") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, and the accompanying notes included in
2020
Part I, Item 1
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2019 incorporated by reference.
We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs  by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year.  Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales.  We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs.  Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent.  Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of comparable sales).  Traffic will now be referred to "transactions" and  measures a percentage change in all sales transactions in our comparable stores, as well as for comparable eCommerce activity. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation.  We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.Each of our segments contribute to the Company's operating results differently.  Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We recently took some strategic actions to further position our portfolio for long-term growth, including: •Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") in August 2018.  •Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019, substantially all of which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.•Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively. In April 2019, we announced the termination of the previously announced merger agreement that would have provided for the combination of J Sainsbury plc and ASDA Group Limited, our U.K. subsidiary.

The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses.  Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence.  We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates").  We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.

Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:•strong, efficient growth;•consistent operating discipline; and•strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.

Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs.  At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.  As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases.  Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:
Three Months Ended April 30,  2019 2018 2019 2018  With Fuel Fuel ImpactWalmart U.S. 3.3% 2.4% 0.0% 0.1%Sam's Club 1.4% 5.3% 0.9% 1.4%Total U.S. 3.0% 2.8% 0.1% 0.3%
The Walmart U.S. segment had growth of 3.3% and 2.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, driven by growth in ticket and transactions.  For the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.0% to comparable sales, respectively.  Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 1.4% and 5.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from increased transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket.  The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% and 0.8% to comparable sales, respectively, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018.  The increase in comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations.

Consistent Operating Discipline
We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.  We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs.  We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.
Three Months Ended April 30,(Amounts in millions) 2019 2018Net sales $122,949 $121,630Percentage change from comparable period 1.1% 4.4%Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $25,946 $25,829Percentage change from comparable period 0.5% 4.9%Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.1% 21.2%

For the three months ended April 30, 2019 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 14 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three months ended April 30, 2019 were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements in our Walmart U.S. segment.  Our International and Sam's Club segments also leveraged expenses when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

Strategic Capital Allocation
We are allocating more capital to store remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years.  This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping and is consistent with the capital expenditure detail provided in the following table:

Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time.  We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics.  In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets.  While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 4.0% and 4.8% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The decline in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months, primarily resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and net unrealized losses on our JD.com investment.  ROI was 14.5% and 13.9% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The increase in ROI was due to the increase in operating income over the trailing twelve months primarily as a result of lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the Flipkart Acquisition was primarily offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02") as operating lease right-of-use assets are now included in total assets.We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.  Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized.  For fiscal 2020, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8.  A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard.  Further, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right-of-use asset balance.Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.  Because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for the comparable fiscal 2019 period was not revised.Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of $3.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019, which declined when compared to $5.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase in inventory related to accelerated buying in certain categories, the timing of sell through for summer seasonal merchandise and increased eCommerce fulfillment center mirroring, as well as the timing of payments.  We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019, which declined when compared to $3.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $1.2 billion or 1.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase in revenues was due to an increase in net sales, which was primarily due to overall positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, the addition of Flipkart's net sales, and positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil.  Our gross profit rate decreased 27 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The decrease was primarily due to the addition of Flipkart and price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements in our Walmart U.S. segment.  Our International and Sam's Club segments also leveraged expenses when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.Other (gains) and losses increased $2.7 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 due to fair value changes of our investment in JD.com.Our effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2019, compared to 19.3% for the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was primarily due to a favorable, provisional amount recognized related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 during the three months ended April 30, 2018.  Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be higher than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $1.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.33 for the three months ended April 30, 2019, which represents an increase of $0.61 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $2.6 billion or 3.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase in net sales was due to comparable sales of 3.3% driven by growth in ticket and transactions.  Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% to comparable sales during the three months ended April 30, 2019 and were driven by online grocery and ship-to-home. Gross profit rate increased 6 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The improvement was due to favorable merchandise mix and less pressure from transportation costs, partially offset by price investments.  The merchandise mix improvement was the result of strong private brands penetration and eCommerce performance in the home and apparel categories.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by continued investments in eCommerce. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $215 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $1.5 billion or 4.9% for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  This decrease was due to $1.8 billion of negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset by the addition of Flipkart's net sales and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets.  Gross profit rate decreased 172 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The decrease was primarily due to the addition of Flipkart, as well as a change in merchandise mix in certain other markets.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to the prior year charge related to the divestiture of our Canada banking operations of approximately $81 million and the prior year wind down of the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $527 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

(1)  We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices.  Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.2 billion or 1.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase was due to comparable sales of 1.4%.  Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% to comparable sales.  In addition, higher fuel sales of $135 million also contributed to the comparable sales growth.  These increases were partially offset by a reduction in tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. Gross profit rate increased 47 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The gross profit rate benefited from decreased tobacco sales, which have lower margins, and lapping inventory exit costs associated with closed clubs.  These benefits were partially offset by increased eCommerce fulfillment and shipping costs.Membership and other income increased 4.7% for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to gains recognized on asset sales and increased Plus Members penetration.Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 32 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  This decrease was primarily the result of a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period, partially offset by a reduction in tobacco sales.As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $126 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Three months ended April 30,(Amounts in millions) 2019 2018Net cash provided by operating activities $3,563 $5,161
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion and $5.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory related to accelerated buying in certain categories, the timing of sell through for summer seasonal merchandise and increased eCommerce fulfillment center mirroring, as well as the timing of payments.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were $9.3 billion and $7.9 billion at April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Our working capital deficit was $18.1 billion and $21.5 billion at April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.  The decreased working capital deficit at April 30, 2019 compared to April 30, 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.  Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  We are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department.  We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.As of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.  Of the $2.7 billion at April 30, 2019, approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.5 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019, primarily as a result of proceeds received from the sale of our Canada bank.  These proceeds were partially offset by an increase in investments in eCommerce, technology and supply chain as well as payments to remodel existing stores and clubs.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Three months ended April 30,(Amounts in millions) 2019 2018Net cash used in financing activities $(846) $(2,486)
Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.  Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to $4.0 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund general business operations, along with a reduction in the repayment of long-term debt.  This decrease in net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by cash outflows related to changes in short term borrowings and an increase in share repurchases, due to the prior year suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement.  Additionally, the Company has committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion as of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively, all undrawn.

Our total outstanding long-term debt balance increased $3.5 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019, primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund general business operations.
Dividends
On February 19, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share.  For fiscal 2020, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:

The dividend installments payable on April 1, 2019 and June 3, 2019 were paid as scheduled.
Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2019, were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  As of April 30, 2019, authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.  We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.

We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets.  At April 30, 2019, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Rating agency  Commercial paper  Long-term debtStandard & Poor's  A-1+  AAMoody's Investors Service  P-1  Aa2Fitch Ratings  F1+  AA
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments.  Our market risks at April 30, 2019 are similar to those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.  The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2019, under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and implemented new systems and internal controls in conjunction with the new lease standard.  These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective.An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters.  The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.  For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA.In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas.  The Company is challenging the fine and denies any wrongdoing.In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board ("ARB") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs.  The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement.  The Company has denied any wrongdoing.In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank.  The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred.  Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2019, were made under the current $20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of April 30, 2019, authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock.  Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended , was as follows:

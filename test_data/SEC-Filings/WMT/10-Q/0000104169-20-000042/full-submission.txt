The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020").  Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during the month of July related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns.  Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.  Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.
Receivables
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for credit losses, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions.

Note 2.  Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:

Note 4.  Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt
The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program.  In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion.  In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, all undrawn.

Note 5.  Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:•Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD.com) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The fair value of the Company's equity investments are as follows:
(Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of July 31, 2020 Fair Value as of January 31, 2020Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $4,689 $2,715Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,204 2,723Total $9,893 $5,438
Derivatives
The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value.  Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves.  As of July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:
July 31, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions)Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges$4,000 $205(1) $4,000 $97(1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges3,500 471(1) 3,750 455(1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges4,271 (748)(2) 4,067 (696)(2) Total$11,771 $(72) $11,817 $(144)
(1) Classified in Other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(2) Classified in Deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.  The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of July 31, 2020.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, are as follows:

Note 6.  Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings.  The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made.  However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed.  The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value ("Equal Value") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future.  The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in July 2020. The Company is awaiting a decision.Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.
Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters
In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.

Note 7.  Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.  Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacy transactions and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability.
Net sales by segment are as follows:

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview
This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 ("fiscal ") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, and the accompanying notes included in
2021
Part I, Item 1
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2020, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020
.
We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.  Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs  by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period.  Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales.  We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally and those initiated through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs.  Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent.  Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation.  We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently.  Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses.  Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence.  We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates").  We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events and global health epidemics including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.  Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "

COVID-19 Updates
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture, become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. These areas of focus are fundamental in running our business every day, and even more so now as Walmart plays an important role during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting our associates. We remain focused on our strategy while also prioritizing the physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being of our associates.  In the U.S., we provided extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses to store associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy.  We have also done similar things in some of our international markets to support and reward associates.Serving our customers. From an operational standpoint, stores continued to operate at reduced hours to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing, posted social-distancing decals, implemented protocols for temperature checks, began metering the number of customers in a store or club at any one time, and installed sneeze guards at pharmacies and checkouts. Stores, clubs, and facilities received masks and gloves, and associates and customers are required to wear face coverings to protect both associates and our customers. Globally, we hired more than 500,000 associates through August 2020, many of whom are temporary. Helping others. We increased our giving to community organizations and continued food donations from our stores and distribution centers.  We supported tenants in various markets by waiving or discounting rent for in-store tenants during April 2020, which continued through May 2020. Managing the business and driving our long-term strategy. As we take care of associates, customers and communities, we continue to manage the business and drive our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price discipline and our omni-channel offering continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in broad challenges globally in the first half fiscal 2021, including new and varying government regulations, stretching our supply chain, and introducing significant sales volatility as well as channel and mix shifts due to changing consumer habits.  Increased demand led to strong growth in net sales, including eCommerce growth acceleration, and higher operating expenses during the six months ended July 31, 2020. Although gross margin rates were flat for the six months ended July 31, 2020, gross margin rates significantly improved in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations" below.We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; the length and impact of any stay–at–home orders or government mandates; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which will impact our results in the short term.In the current environment, we believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.


Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:•strong, efficient growth;•consistent operating discipline; and•strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.  The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand and overall net sales growth through the first two quarters of fiscal 2021.  As our Company continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized our focus on associate care, including extra pay and benefits as well as masks and gloves; increased cleaning and sanitation measures; customer safety; and new associate hiring.  Additionally, we've reduced capital spending, delayed certain consulting projects, and reduced marketing and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs.  At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.  Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.  As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases.  Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:
Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31,  2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019  With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel ImpactWalmart U.S. 9.7% 2.9% (0.2)% 0.0% 10.1% 3.1% (0.3)% 0.0%Sam's Club 8.8% 1.7% (4.7)% 0.6% 9.2% 1.6% (4.0)% 0.8%Total U.S. 9.6% 2.7% (0.8)% 0.0% 10.0% 2.8% (0.7)% 0.0%
Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 9.6% and 10.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 9.7% and 10.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips.  With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 6.0% and 5.0% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 8.8% and 9.2% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively.  The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower fuel sales and our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations.  The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.0% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively.

Consistent Operating Discipline
We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.  We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs.  We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.
Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31,(Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019Net sales $136,824 $129,388 $270,496 $252,337Percentage change from comparable period 5.7% 1.8% 7.2% 1.5%Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $28,994 $26,871 $56,366 $52,817Percentage change from comparable period 7.9% 0.6% 6.7% 0.5%Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.2% 20.8% 20.8% 20.9%
Despite the increase in net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic for the three months ended July 31, 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 42 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily the result of $1.5 billion of incremental expenses related to associate care and customer safety during the COVID-19 pandemic which included special bonuses, additional cleaning and supplies, emergency leave pay and other similar charges, as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in Walmart U.S.For the six months ended July 31, 2020 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 9 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary driver of the expense leverage was due to our growth in comparable store sales driven by strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by $2.4 billion of incremental expenses described above during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in Walmart U.S.

Strategic Capital Allocation
Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. In recent years, we have allocated more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. We will continue to remain disciplined with our capital spending in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Total capital expenditures for the six months ended July 31, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S.; the following table provides additional detail:
(Amounts in millions) Six Months Ended July 31,Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2020 2019eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $1,814 $2,327Store remodels 822 1,310New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 43 41Total U.S. 2,679 3,678Walmart International 890 1,193Total Capital Expenditures $3,569 $4,871


Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time.  We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics.  In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets.  While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  ROA was 7.7% and 6.0% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily driven by the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com, partially offset by the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart.  ROI was 13.5% and 14.3% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart.  We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2019, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8.  A two-point average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.  Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of $19.0 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020, which increased when compared to $11.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments.  We generated free cash flow of $15.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020, which increased when compared to $6.3 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.3 billion in decreased capital expenditures due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $7.4 billion or 5.6% and $18.1 billion or 7.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  These increases in revenue were due to increases in net sales, which were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from strong demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with positive comparable sales in majority of our international markets, despite operating limitations in several markets due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 billion and $3.7 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively.  As the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the U.S in late February, we saw the mix of sales shift heavily toward food and consumables as consumers initiated stock-up trips.  Toward the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and throughout the second quarter of fiscal 2021, sales increased in several general merchandise categories which were heavily influenced by stimulus dollars in the U.S.  eCommerce sales remained strong throughout the first half of fiscal 2021 as more customers gravitated toward and continued using store pickup and delivery.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate") increased 63 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily the result of strong sales in higher-margin general merchandise categories, which in the U.S. was aided by government stimulus, lower markdowns, and better fuel margins.The gross profit rate was flat for the six months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  The increase in the gross profit rate for the three months ended July 31, 2020, as described above, was offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investments as well the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 42 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to $1.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 9 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, partially offset by $2.4 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment.Other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $3.2 billion and a loss of $0.1 billion for the three months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a gain of $3.9 billion and $0.8 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily representing the fair value change of our JD.com investment.Our effective income tax rate was 25.5% and 25.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 25.1% and 24.7% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $2.27 and $3.67 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, which represents an increase of $1.01 and $1.08 when compared to the same periods, respectively, in the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $8.1 billion or 9.5% and $16.5 billion or 10.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were due to comparable sales of 9.7% and 10.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to economic conditions and government stimulus initiatives related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Customers continued consolidating shopping trips and purchasing larger baskets which contributed to the growth in average ticket while transactions decreased.  Stimulus funds resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic tapered off contributing to slower growth in comparable sales towards the end of the second quarter.  With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 6.0% and 5.0% to comparable sales during the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Gross profit rate increased 42 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to increased sales of higher-margin general merchandise categories, fewer markdowns, and improvements in walmart.com's contribution to gross margin rates.  Gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to carryover of prior year price investments as well the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the gross profit rate increase during the three months ended July 31, 2020.Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 41 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to $1.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including special bonuses for store associates, additional costs associated with outfitting our associates with masks and gloves, expanded cleaning practices, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay, as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 22 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $1.9 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the $0.4 billion business restructuring charge described above.As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $2.0 billion or 6.8% and $1.0 billion or 1.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The decreases were primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $2.4 billion and $3.7 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, which were partially offset by positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March, we experienced significant economic pressure, channel shift and mix shifts in our major markets as customers focused on pantry stock-ups and reduced purchases of non-essential products. Through April and into May, we experienced extensive store and operational closures in several markets such as India, South Africa and Central America as government mandates limited or restricted the sale of certain products.  By the end of the second quarter, most of our closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations.Gross profit rate increased 74 and 39 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases in gross profit rate for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 were due to reduced fuel sales in the U.K. and limited operations in our Flipkart business during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 65 and 24 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were primarily due to $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, including additional costs related to customer and associate health as well as increased cleaning practices, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and bonuses for store associates.  The incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were partially offset by the current period impact of a twelve-month property tax abatement in the U.K.As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

(1)  We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.3 billion or 8.8% and $2.7 billion or 9.2% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.8% and 9.2% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively.  Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and partially offset by lower fuel sales and our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.0% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively. Gross profit rate increased 105 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to higher fuel margins, lower markdowns, and improvements in inventory losses.  The increase in the gross profit rate for the three months ended July 31, 2020, was partially offset by investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.  Gross profit rate increased 64 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to higher fuel margins, improvements in inventory losses, and reduction in the sale of tobacco, which has lower margins. The increase in the gross profit rates for the six months ended July 31, 2020, was partially offset by investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.  Membership and other income increased 4.0% and 4.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 were due to increases in total members, overall renewal rates, and Plus penetration rate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increase in net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 52 and 32 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  The increases were primarily the result of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, including additional costs such as special bonuses for club associates, expanded security and cleaning practices, outfitting our associates with masks and gloves, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay. Additionally, the increases in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales were affected by reduced fuel and tobacco sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $112 million and $155 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Six Months Ended July 31,(Amounts in millions) 2020 2019Net cash provided by operating activities $18,956 $11,185
Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion and $11.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 31, 2020, was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit
Cash and cash equivalents were $16.9 billion and $9.3 billion at July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  We maintained more cash at July 31, 2020 compared to July 31, 2019 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our working capital deficit was $17.0 billion at July 31, 2020, which decreased when compared to $18.9 billion at July 31, 2019.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.  Of the $1.9 billion at July 31, 2020, approximately $0.4 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Six Months Ended July 31,(Amounts in millions) 2020 2019Net cash used in investing activities  $(3,634) $(3,824)
Net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020, primarily as a result of decreased capital expenditures, partially offset by lapping net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada in fiscal 2020.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Six Months Ended July 31,(Amounts in millions) 2020 2019Net cash used in financing activities $(7,814) $(5,531)
Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.  Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities was $7.8 billion and $5.5 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a reduction in share repurchases and short-term borrowings as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment.   In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion.  In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2020, all undrawn.

For fiscal 2021, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:
Record Date  Payable DateMarch 20, 2020  April 6, 2020May 8, 2020  June 1, 2020August 14, 2020  September 8, 2020December 11, 2020  January 4, 2021
The dividend installments payable on April 6, 2020 and June 1, 2020 were paid as scheduled.
Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2020 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  As of July 31, 2020, authorization for $5.0 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

Table of Contents

We continue to review our share repurchase activity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.  We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the six months ended

July 31, 2020
and
2019
:
Six Months Ended July 31,(Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019Total number of shares repurchased 6.3 36.6Average price paid per share $114.73 $101.26Total amount paid for share repurchases $723 $3,707
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets.  We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn.  At July 31, 2020, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Rating agency  Commercial paper  Long-term debtStandard & Poor's  A-1+  AAMoody's Investors Service  P-1  Aa2Fitch Ratings  F1+  AA
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. The Company is cooperating with the Municipality.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.  The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions have had wide-ranging effects on our business and the global economy and have exacerbated the potential for certain risks identified in that disclosure, including, without limitation, risks related to the successful execution of our omni-channel strategy, operational risks associated with geo-political and catastrophic events, risks associated with our suppliers, reputational risks and risk associated with changes in and failure to comply with laws and regulations, to materially and adversely affect our financial performance.  The financial impact to the Company of the COVID-19 pandemic during the six month period ended July 31, 2020, as well as certain of the actions we have taken to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers, members and the communities we serve, are discussed in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  Given the uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect in the U.S and the other markets we serve, there can be no assurance that the pandemic will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in the future.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2020, were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  As of July 31, 2020, authorization for $5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock.  Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended, was as follows:

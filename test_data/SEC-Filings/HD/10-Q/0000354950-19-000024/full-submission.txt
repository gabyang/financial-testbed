NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company," "Home Depot," "we," "our" or "us") have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. As a result, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2018 Form 10-K.There were no significant changes to our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2018 Form 10-K, except as set forth below.
Leases
On February 4, 2019, we adopted the new leases standard using the modified retrospective transition method, which requires that we recognize leases differently pre- and post-adoption. See "—Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements—ASU No. 2016-02" below for more information.We categorize leases at their inception as either operating or finance leases. Lease agreements cover certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment, and vehicles. Most of these leases are operating leases; however, certain retail locations and equipment are leased under finance leases. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current operating lease liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in net property and equipment, current installments of long-term debt, and long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.Leased assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use a secured incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in the contract is not readily determinable. We determine a secured rate on a quarterly basis and update the weighted average discount rate accordingly. For operating leases with variable payments dependent upon an index or rate that commenced subsequent to adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, we apply the active index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the operating lease liability as they cannot be reasonably estimated and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Leases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement date are considered short-term in nature. Accordingly, short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences on the date we have the right to control the property.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2018-02. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," which allows for an optional reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects as a result of the Tax Act. On February 4, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2018-02 resulting in an increase of $31 million to retained earnings and a decrease of $31 million to accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU No. 2017-12. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities," which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements. ASU No. 2017-12 eliminates the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges and allows an entity to apply the shortcut method to partial-term fair value hedges of interest rate risk. On February 4, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2017-12 with no impact to our consolidated financial statements. We expect the impact of the adoption to be immaterial to our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows on an ongoing basis. ASU No. 2016-02. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," which establishes a right-of-use model and requires an entity that is a lessee to recognize the right-of-use assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheets. ASU No. 2016-02 also requires disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting both the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statements of earnings. This guidance was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842; and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. ASU No. 2016-02 and subsequent updates require a modified retrospective transition, with the cumulative effect of transition, including initial recognition of lease assets and liabilities for existing operating leases, as of (i) the effective date or (ii) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. These updates also provide a number of practical expedients for implementation which we are applying, as discussed below.On February 4, 2019 (the “effective date”), we adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and subsequent updates, collectively referred to as Topic 842, using the modified retrospective transition method. In addition, we adopted the package of practical expedients in transition, which permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions pertaining to lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs on leases that commenced prior to our adoption of the new standard. We also elected the ongoing practical expedient to not recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities related to short-term leases. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or land easements practical expedients. For leases beginning subsequent to the effective date, we elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment. To determine the measurement of the lease liability for operating leases with variable payments based on an index or rate that commenced prior to the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to apply the active index or rate at the effective date.As a result of adopting Topic 842, we recognized net operating lease right-of-use assets of $5.7 billion and operating lease liabilities of $6.0 billion on the effective date. Existing prepaid rent, accrued rent, and closed store reserves were recorded as an offset to our gross operating lease right-of-use assets. The cumulative effect of the adoption resulted in an immaterial adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of February 4, 2019. The standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

Note: Net sales for certain merchandising departments were reclassified in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result, prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current-period presentation.

3.PROPERTY AND LEASES
Net Property and Equipment
Net property and equipment includes accumulated depreciation and amortization of $20.9 billion as of May 5, 2019 and $20.6 billion as of February 3, 2019.
Leases
We lease certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment, and vehicles. While most of these leases are operating leases, certain retail locations and equipment are leased under finance leases. We consider various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist to determine whether we will renew or replace the lease. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years, typically with the option to extend the leases for up to five years. Some of our leases may include the option to terminate in less than five years. In the event we are reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend a lease, we will include the extended terms in the operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are our obligations under the lease agreements.Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Further, certain lease agreements include rental payments based on an index or rate and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. The gross amounts of assets and liabilities related to both operating and finance leases follow.

5.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of DirectorsThe Home Depot, Inc.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the Consolidated Balance Sheet of The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of May 5, 2019, the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for the three-month periods ended May 5, 2019 and April 29, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the “Consolidated Interim Financial Information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Consolidated Interim Financial Information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of February 3, 2019, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 28, 2019, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 3, 2019, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This Consolidated Interim Financial Information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Executive Summary
Highlights of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 follow.

We reported net sales of $26.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net earnings were $2.5 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share. We opened three new stores in the U.S. and closed one store in Mexico during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, for a total store count of 2,289 at the end of the quarter. As of May 5, 2019, a total of 305 of our stores, or 13.3%, were located in Canada and Mexico. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales per square foot were $435.18 and our inventory turnover ratio was 4.7 times.We generated $4.6 billion of cash flow from operations during the first three months of fiscal 2019. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to pay $1.5 billion of dividends, repay $967 million of short-term debt, fund cash payments of $1.4 billion for share repurchases, and fund $681 million in capital expenditures.During the first three months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased a total of 6.5 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions. In February 2019, we announced a 32.0% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.36 per share.Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 45.4% at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).

Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and in the 2018 Form 10-K and with our MD&A included in the 2018 Form 10-K. We believe the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts, are relevant to an evaluation of our business.

Sales. We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.Net Sales. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5.7% to $26.4 billion from $24.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions. Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 8.9% of net sales and grew 23.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by $76 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excluding closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365th day of operation. Acquisitions, digital or otherwise, are included in comparable sales after we own the acquired assets for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales includes new product and service offering sales that have been offered for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales excludes prior-year sales of product and service offerings that we have exited in the current period. Fiscal 2019 includes 52 weeks and fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks. For our calculation of comparable sales in fiscal 2019, we will compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2019 against weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2018. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.Total comparable sales increased 2.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, consisting of a 2.0% increase in comparable average ticket and a 0.5% increase in comparable customer transactions. The increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds. Comparable sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 reflected a negative impact due to a shift in the comparable base as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2018. Total comparable sales in the first quarter of 2019 also reflected the impact of lumber price deflation, wet weather in February, and higher prior-year hurricane-related sales.All of our departments except for four posted positive comparable sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Comparable sales for our Appliances, Indoor Garden, Décor/Storage, Tools, Outdoor Garden, Building Materials, Plumbing, and Hardware merchandising departments were above the Company average in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Comparable sales for Flooring and Millwork were slightly negative due to the impact of higher prior-year hurricane-related sales. Electrical/Lighting was negatively impacted by light bulbs while Lumber was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $400 million to $9.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from $8.6 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 34.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by a change in product mix, higher shrink, and higher supply chain and fulfillment expense. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A increased $161 million to $4.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from $4.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 18.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 19.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and continued expense control.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $23 million to $480 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from $457 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.8% in the first quarter of both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, reflecting the offsetting effects of strategic investments in the business, leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment, and timing of asset additions. Interest and Other, net. Interest and other, net, was $273 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $239 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 and primarily reflected higher interest expense resulting from higher debt balances.Provision for Income Taxes. Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 23.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in the provision for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the prior-year impact of certain state tax settlements.Diluted Earnings per Share. Diluted earnings per share were $2.27 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $2.08 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure), follows.

Additional Information
For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Cash Equivalents
At May 5, 2019, we had $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, cash flow generated from operations, and funds available under our commercial paper programs should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. As we continue our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019.
Debt and Derivatives
We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings of up to $3.0 billion. All of our short-term borrowings in the first three months of fiscal 2019 were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.1 billion. In connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion, which consist of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2022 and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2019. At May 5, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At May 5, 2019, there were $372 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. We also issue senior notes from time to time.We use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on certain long-term debt.
Share Repurchases
In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. In the first three months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 6.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.3 billion through open market purchases.

Cash Flows Summary
Operating Activities. Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations, and occupancy costs. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $594 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2018 and was primarily driven by net cash inflows associated with changes in working capital and an increase in net earnings. The increase in net earnings during the first three months of fiscal 2019 was due to the positive comparable sales environment and expense leverage.Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflected capital expenditures from the continuation of our strategic investments in our business of $681 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019 compared to $556 million of capital expenditures in the first three months of fiscal 2018.Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities primarily reflected:• $1.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $1.4 billion of share repurchases, and $967 million of net repayments of short-term debt in the first three months of fiscal 2019, and•$1.2 billion of net repayments of short-term debt, $1.2 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.1 billion of share repurchases in the first three months of fiscal 2018.

Critical Accounting Policies
There were no changes during fiscal 2019 to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in the 2018 Form 10-K. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Our exposure to market risks results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. We are also exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those disclosed in the 2018 Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Under the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 5, 2019. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended May 5, 2019, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
Except as set forth below, there were no material changes during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to our disclosure in Item 3 of our 2018 Form 10-K.SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.As previously reported, in January 2017, we became aware of an investigation by the EPA’s criminal investigation division into our compliance with lead-safe work practices for certain jobs performed through our installation services business. We have also previously responded to civil document requests from several EPA regions. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we received a subpoena for documents from the EPA civil enforcement division. We are currently in discussions with the civil division of the EPA. We are continuing to cooperate with the EPA.

(1)  These amounts include repurchases pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and our 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Plans"). Under the Plans, participants may surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock and deferred share awards. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.
(2)  In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. The program does not have a prescribed expiration date.
Sales of Unregistered Securities
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we issued 644 deferred stock units under the Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SEC’s Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we credited 1,386 deferred stock units to participant accounts under the Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 2, 2014, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Business
The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. The stores stock approximately 30,000 to 40,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers and professional customers. The Company also offers over 700,000 products through its websites, including Home Depot, Home Decorators Collection and Blinds.com.
Valuation Reserves
As of May 4, 2014 and February 2, 2014, the valuation allowances for Merchandise Inventories and uncollectible Receivables were not material.

2.INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS, INC.
At the end of fiscal 2013, the Company owned 16.3 million shares of HD Supply Holdings, Inc. ("HD Supply") common stock, which represented approximately 8% of the shares of HD Supply common stock outstanding. This investment is accounted for using the cost method, as there are significant restrictions in place on the Company's ability to sell or transfer its HD Supply shares. The restrictions are controlled by the three largest shareholders of HD Supply (the "Principal Shareholders"). The carrying value of the HD Supply shares was impaired by the Company to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2009. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Principal Shareholders elected to sell shares in a secondary public offering of HD Supply common stock. Under the terms of a registration rights agreement among the Company, HD Supply and the Principal Shareholders, the Company had the right to include a portion of its shares in the offering, and the Company elected to do so. As a result, the restrictions on 3.9 million shares were lifted so that they could be sold in the offering. The Company received $97 million of proceeds from the sale of these shares and recognized a corresponding gain within Interest and Investment Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three months ended May 4, 2014. The remaining 12.4 million shares owned by the Company, which represents approximately 6% of the shares of HD Supply common stock outstanding, continue to be accounted for using the cost method as the restrictions on these shares remain in place.

3.ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of the Company’s common stock. Under this agreement, the Company paid $950 million to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 9.5 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The transaction was completed later in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the Company received approximately 2.6 million additional shares. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $950 million ASR agreement was determined with reference to the average price of the Company's common stock over the term of the agreement. The $950 million of shares repurchased is included in Treasury Stock in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 4, 2014.

4.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities

Table of ContentsTHE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)

recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:
•Level 1 –Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets•Level 2 –Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable•Level 3 –Unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 4, 2014 and February 2, 2014 were as follows (amounts in millions):
Fair Value at May 4, 2014 Using Fair Value at February 2, 2014 Using Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Level 1     Level 2     Level 3    Derivative agreements - assets$— $20 $— $— $30 $—Derivative agreements - liabilities— (11) — — (10) —Total$— $9 $— $— $20 $—
The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on long-term debt and its exposure on foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments was measured using level 2 inputs.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Long-lived assets were analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and 2013 were not material.The aggregate fair value of the Company’s senior notes, based on quoted market prices, was $15.9 billion and $15.6 billion at May 4, 2014 and February 2, 2014, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $14.2 billion and $14.2 billion at May 4, 2014 and February 2, 2014, respectively.

5.BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES
The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares for the three months ended May 4, 2014 and May 5, 2013 was as follows (amounts in millions):
Three Months Ended May 4, 2014 May 5, 2013Weighted average common shares1,367 1,468Effect of potentially dilutive securities:   Stock plans9 10Diluted weighted average common shares1,376 1,478
Stock plans consist of shares granted under the Company’s employee stock plans. Options to purchase 2 million and 1 million shares of common stock for the three months ended May 4, 2014 and May 5, 2013, respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA
For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we reported Net Earnings of $1.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.00 compared to Net Earnings of $1.2 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.83 for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 included a benefit to earnings of $61 million, net of tax, related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply Holdings, Inc. ("HD Supply"), which contributed $0.04 to Diluted Earnings per Share.Net Sales increased 2.9% to $19.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $19.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Our comparable store sales increased 2.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a 2.1% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 3.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we continued to focus on the following key initiatives:Customer Service – Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, our Pro Xtra loyalty program continued to gain traction, and over 1.5 million professional customers have now enrolled. The Pro Xtra loyalty program provides our professional customers with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and streamlined payment and receipt tracking tools.Product Authority – Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering product innovation, assortment and value. As part of this effort, we continued to introduce innovative new products and great values for our professional, do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments. This includes plans to expand our offerings in LED light bulbs from Cree, introduce a gas powered lawn mower that can be folded and stored upright from Toro, and add KitchenAid to our appliance assortment.Disciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency – Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we introduced our new Customer Order Management system to our first U.S. store. This system is designed for greater visibility and improved execution of special orders by our associates and a more seamless experience for our customers. We intend to roll this system out to all U.S. stores by the end of the fiscal 2014.In addition, we repurchased a total of 15.8 million shares of our common stock for $1.25 billion through an Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") agreement and the open market during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.Interconnected Retail – Our focus on interconnected retail, which connects our other three key initiatives, is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience, resulting in improved customer satisfaction scores and online sales conversion rates. Sales from our online channels increased approximately 39% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year and now represent approximately 4.2% percent of our total Net Sales. Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we launched an online e-commerce website in Mexico by piloting it in limited markets with plans to provide coverage across the country.We did not open or close any stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and we had a total store count of 2,263 at the end of the quarter. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, a total of 286 of our stores, or 12.6%, were located in Canada and Mexico.We generated $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This cash flow was used to fund $1.25 billion of share repurchases, pay $646 million of dividends and fund $287 million in capital expenditures.Our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 21.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 17.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 increased 2.9% to $19.7 billion from $19.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The increase in Net Sales for the first quarter fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by customer transactions and average ticket growth. Total comparable store sales increased 2.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to an increase of 4.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives and continued strength in our core categories, offset in part by the effects of extreme winter weather. All of our departments except two posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales for our Tools, Electrical, Plumbing, Kitchen, Bath, Hardware, Décor, Building Materials, Millwork and Lighting product categories were above the Company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales for our Flooring, Indoor Garden and Paint product categories were positive for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales for our Outdoor Garden and Lumber product categories were negative for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting the impact of extreme winter weather and commodity price deflation.Gross Profit increased 3.1% to $6.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 35.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 34.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 5 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was driven primarily by a lower penetration of lower margin product categories like Lumber and Outdoor Garden. Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A") were $4.2 billion for the first quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 21.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 21.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls and lower management bonuses than last year.Depreciation and Amortization increased 3.0% to $414 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $402 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. Operating Income increased 8.7% to $2.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $2.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 11.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 10.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized $91 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $161 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 0.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 included a $97 million pretax gain related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply. Our combined effective income tax rate was 36.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 36.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Diluted Earnings per Share were $1.00 for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to $0.83 for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Diluted Earnings per Share for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflect $0.04 of benefit related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in HD Supply.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $2.6 billion compared to $2.7 billion for the same period in fiscal 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from net working capital items as a result of a weather-related shift in sales to the second quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by an increase in Net Earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $280 million compared to $276 million for the same period in fiscal 2013. The amount of cash flow used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily Capital Expenditures, was consistent with the same period last year.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1.7 billion compared to $589 million for the same period of fiscal 2013. This change was primarily the result of $2.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 offset by $946 million less in repurchases of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013.In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of our common stock. Under this agreement, we paid $950 million to the financial institution and received a total of 12.1 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $950 million ASR agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. Also in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million additional shares of our common stock for $300 million in the open market. We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. At May 4, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. As of May 4, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.As of May 4, 2014, we had $2.5 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.

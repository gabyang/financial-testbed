1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of The Home Depot, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. As a result, these statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 29, 2017, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2017 (the "2016 Form 10-K").
Valuation Reserves
As of April 30, 2017 and January 29, 2017, the valuation allowances for Merchandise Inventories and uncollectible Receivables were not material.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
There have been no material changes to the Company’s position regarding recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption as disclosed in the 2016 Form 10-K, except as set forth below.In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU No. 2014-09 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition principles, and it permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods.The Company continues to evaluate the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures and controls. Based on its preliminary assessment, the Company has determined that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 could impact the timing of revenue recognition through its services, gift card and various incentive programs. ASU No. 2014-09 will impact the Company’s method of recognizing gift card breakage income, which is currently recognized based upon historical redemption patterns. ASU No. 2014-09 requires gift card breakage income to be recognized in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer when the Company expects to be entitled to breakage. The Company is also evaluating the principal versus agent considerations as it relates to certain arrangements with third parties that could impact the presentation of gross or net revenue reporting. Other areas which could be impacted may be identified as the Company continues its evaluation of ASU No. 2014-09. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption not discussed above or in the 2016 Form 10-K are either not applicable or will not have or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company.


2.RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
On January 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting". Upon adoption of this update, all excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to share-based payment awards are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they occur. Previously these amounts were reflected in paid-in capital. In addition, upon adoption these amounts are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period in which they occur. Previously, these amounts were reflected as a financing activity. Cash paid by the Company to tax authorities when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes will continue to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense will continue to reflect estimated forfeitures of share-based awards. The Company has adopted the applicable provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 prospectively.

Table of ContentsTHE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)

As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, the Company recognized $65 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in its provision for income taxes during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The recognition of these benefits contributed $0.05 to Diluted Earnings per Share.

3.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The carrying amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables and Accounts Payable reported in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents the assets and liabilities, if any, of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (amounts in millions):

The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate exposure on certain Long-Term Debt and its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Long-lived assets were analyzed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3). Impairment charges related to long-lived assets in the first three months of fiscal 2017 and 2016 were not material.
The aggregate fair and carrying values of the Company's senior notes were as follows (amounts in billions): April 30, 2017 January 29, 2017 Fair Value(Level 1) CarryingValue Fair Value(Level 1) CarryingValueSenior notes$24.0 $22.0 $23.6 $22.0

5.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Data Breach
As previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in the Company’s U.S. and Canadian stores (the "Data Breach"). Since the end of fiscal 2016, there have been no material changes with respect to the Data Breach, except as discussed below.As reported in the 2016 Form 10-K, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company agreed to settlement terms that, upon approval of the court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the financial institutions class actions. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the parties to the two purported shareholder derivative actions agreed to settlement terms that, upon approval of the court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in those actions.As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company has resolved the most significant claims relating to the Data Breach, and there were no material changes during the first quarter to the Company’s loss contingency assessment relating to any remaining matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate amounts paid with respect to any remaining matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and StockholdersThe Home Depot, Inc.:We have reviewed the Consolidated Balance Sheet of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 30, 2017, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for the three-month periods ended April 30, 2017 and May 1, 2016. These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2017, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 23, 2017, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those Consolidated Financial Statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 29, 2017, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived.

You should not rely on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond our control or are currently unknown to us – as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report. You should read such information in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA
Net Sales increased 4.9% to $23.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $22.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our total comparable store sales increased 5.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, driven by a 3.9% increase in our comparable store average ticket and a 1.5% increase in our comparable store customer transactions. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 6.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reported Net Earnings of $2.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.67 compared to Net Earnings of $1.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 included a $65 million benefit to our Provision for Income Taxes for share-based payment awards resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This benefit contributed $0.05 to Diluted Earnings per Share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we continued to focus on the following:Customer Experience – Customer experience is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, and our commitment to customer service remains strong. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we continued to connect our associates to the needs of our customers by empowering our associates to deliver excellent customer service, enabled by differentiated staffing models, tools and organizational support. We also continued to connect our stores to our online properties, and our online properties to our stores, to provide a frictionless customer experience across all channels. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we continued the roll out of Interline's product catalog to our stores, which is now operational in over 1,500 U.S. stores, and the capability to accept payment that is linked to existing Interline customer accounts. We also leveraged our digital assets to better understand our customers and meet their needs through targeted online offerings and localized online experiences. We simplified and expedited our online checkout process, effectively reducing our customers' checkout time, and we are seeing increased sales, conversion rates and customer satisfaction scores. Sales from our online channels increased 22.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year, and represented 6.6% of our total Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Product Authority – Product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. We strive to be the leader in product authority, connecting products and services to the needs of our customers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our merchants continued to collaborate with our suppliers to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. Productivity and Efficiency Driven by Capital Allocation – We drive productivity and efficiency through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain. Further, our disciplined capital allocation builds shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we continued to optimize the flow of products from suppliers to shelves and to our customers’ locations through Project Sync. This multi-year supply chain program is designed to create an end-to-end solution that will benefit all participants in our supply chain. We plan to continue to innovate our business model and value chain to support our productivity cycle and enhance overall value for customers throughout the year.In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. Under the program, we repurchased a total of 8.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion through the open market during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Also in February 2017, our Board of Directors increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to 55% of Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2016.We opened two new stores in the U.S. and one new store in Mexico during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, for a total store count of 2,281 at the end of the quarter. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a total of 302 of our stores, or 13.2%, were located in Canada and Mexico.We generated $4.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This cash flow was used to fund cash payments of $1.3 billion for share repurchases, pay $1.1 billion of dividends, repay $710 million of short-term debt and fund $458 million in capital expenditures.Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.8 times at the end of the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. Our return on invested capital (defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period) was 32.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 29.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. For a reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to Net Earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and our calculation of return on invested capital, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.We believe the percentage relationship between Net Sales and the major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of these items as well as the selected sales data presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.

Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 4.9% to $23.9 billion from $22.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by average ticket growth and increased customer transactions. The increase in Net Sales was partially offset by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $71 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Total comparable store sales increased 5.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Comparable store sales for our Appliances, Lumber, Flooring, Tools, Electrical, Plumbing, Décor, Kitchen and Bath, and Indoor Garden product categories were above or at the Company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Further, our comparable store average ticket increased 3.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, flooring and roofing, offset in part by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations. Our comparable store customer transactions increased 1.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Gross Profit increased 4.7% to $8.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $7.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 34.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects the impact of product mix changes.Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased 1.9% to $4.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 18.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 18.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and continued expense control.Depreciation and Amortization increased 2.5% to $444 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $433 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.9% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.Operating Income increased 8.8% to $3.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $3.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 14.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 13.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized $241 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $237 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.0% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016.Our combined effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 36.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 included a $65 million benefit to our Provision for Income Taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. Diluted Earnings per Share were $1.67 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $1.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Diluted Earnings per Share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 included $0.05 of benefit as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.
Return on Invested Capital
We believe return on invested capital ("ROIC") is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as net operating profit after tax ("NOPAT"), a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. The following table provides our ROIC calculation and reconciles NOPAT to Net Earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2017 and May 1, 2016 (amounts in millions):

(1)Income Tax Adjustment is defined as Operating Income multiplied by the Company's effective tax rate.
(2)Average Debt and Equity is defined as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $4.6 billion compared to $3.6 billion for the same period in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily due to $268 million more in cash provided by the effective management of Merchandise Inventories, a $234 million increase in cash flows from Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses related to the timing of purchases and payments, and a $211 million increase in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $445 million compared to $321 million for the same period in fiscal 2016. This change was primarily due to a $133 million increase in Capital Expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $3.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. This change was primarily the result of $360 million more in Repayments of Short-Term Debt, $207 million more in Cash Dividends Paid to Stockholders and $132 million more in Repurchases of Common Stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. The credit facility expires in December 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. At April 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.0 billion. As of April 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.As of April 30, 2017, we had $3.6 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.

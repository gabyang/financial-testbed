FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained herein, as well as in other filings we make with the SEC and other written and oral information we release, regarding our performance or other events or developments in the future constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may relate to, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related recovery on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition (which, among other things, may affect many of the items listed below); the demand for our products and services; net sales growth; comparable sales; the effects of competition; our brand and reputation; implementation of store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives; inventory and in-stock positions; the state of the economy; the state of the housing and home improvement markets; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans, and consumer credit; impact of tariffs; issues related to the payment methods we accept; demand for credit offerings; management of relationships with our associates, potential associates, suppliers and service providers; cost and availability of labor; costs of fuel and other energy sources; international trade disputes, natural disasters, climate change, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines, related shut-downs and other governmental orders, and similar restrictions, as well as subsequent re-openings), cybersecurity events, military conflicts or acts of war, and other business interruptions that could disrupt operation of our stores, distribution centers and other facilities, our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems, or supply or delivery of, or demand for, the Company’s products or services; our ability to meet environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) goals; continuation or suspension of share repurchases; net earnings performance; earnings per share; dividend targets; capital allocation and expenditures; liquidity; return on invested capital; expense leverage; commodity or other price inflation and deflation; our ability to issue debt on terms and at rates acceptable to us; the impact and expected outcome of investigations, inquiries, claims, and litigation, including compliance with related settlements; the effect of accounting charges; the effect of adopting certain accounting standards; the impact of regulatory changes, including changes to tax laws and regulations; store openings and closures; financial outlook; and the impact of acquired companies on our organization and the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions.
Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond our control, dependent on the actions of third parties, or currently unknown to us – as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in
Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors
and elsewhere in this report and also as may be described from time to time in future reports we file with the SEC. You should read such information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
in this report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described herein, generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our filings with the SEC and in our other public statements.

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Home Depot,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, décor items, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products, and provides a number of services, in stores and online. We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico, each representing one of our three operating segments, which we aggregate into one reportable segment due to their similar operating and financial characteristics.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. As a result, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2021 Form 10-K.
There were no significant changes to our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2021 Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the first six months of fiscal 2022 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption not discussed in the 2021 Form 10-K are either not applicable or will not have or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Deferred Revenue
For products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of both July 31, 2022 and January 30, 2022, deferred revenue for products and services was $2.6 billion. We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance. As of July 31, 2022 and January 30, 2022, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $938 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, was immaterial during the three and six months ended July 31, 2022 and August 1, 2021.

3.PROPERTY AND LEASES

4.DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Short-Term Debt
In July 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. All of our short-term borrowings in the first six months of fiscal 2022 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.7 billion. In connection with our program, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks. In July 2022, we also expanded the borrowing capacity under these back-up facilities from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion, by entering into a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2023. These facilities replaced our previously existing five-year $2.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2023, and our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2022. At July 31, 2022 and January 30, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $539 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.
Long-Term Debt
March 2022 Issuance. In March 2022, we issued four tranches of senior notes.•The first tranche consisted of $500 million of 2.70% senior notes due April 15, 2025 (the “2025 notes”) at a discount of $1 million. Interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022.•The second tranche consisted of $750 million of 2.875% senior notes due April 15, 2027 (the “2027 notes”) at a discount of $4 million. Interest on the 2027 notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022.•The third tranche consisted of $1.25 billion of 3.25% senior notes due April 15, 2032 (the “2032 notes”) at a discount of $6 million. Interest on the 2032 notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022.•The fourth tranche consisted of $1.5 billion of 3.625% senior notes due April 15, 2052 (the “2052 notes”) at a discount of $32 million (together with the 2025 notes, the 2027 notes, and the 2032 notes, the “March 2022 issuance”). Interest on the 2052 notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022.•Issuance costs for the March 2022 issuance totaled $22 million.The 2025 notes, 2027 notes, 2032 notes, and 2052 notes may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. Prior to the Par Call Date, as defined in the notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date. On or after the Par Call Date, the redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all such notes have the right to require us to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date.The indenture governing the notes does not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indenture governing the notes contains various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.Repayments. In March 2022, we repaid our $700 million 3.25% senior notes and $300 million floating rate senior notes at maturity. In May 2022, we repaid our $1.25 billion 2.625% senior notes, which had a maturity date of June 2022, at the Par Call Date for the notes.

Table of Contents
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at both July 31, 2022 and January 30, 2022. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At July 31, 2022, the fair values of these agreements totaled $515 million, with $528 million recognized in other long-term liabilities and $13 million recognized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. At January 30, 2022, the fair values of these agreements totaled $191 million, with $249 million recognized in other long-term liabilities and $58 million recognized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt.There were no material changes to the other hedging arrangements disclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K, and all related activity was immaterial for the periods presented within this document.Collateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $470 million as of July 31, 2022, which was recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We did not hold any cash collateral as of July 31, 2022, and cash collateral both held and posted was immaterial as of January 30, 2022.

In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $20.0 billion share repurchase authorization, of which $5.8 billion remained available as of July 31, 2022. In August 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the May 2021 authorization and does not have a prescribed expiration date.
The following table presents information about our repurchases of common stock, all of which were completed through open market purchases:

These amounts may differ from the repurchases of common stock amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to unsettled share repurchases at the end of a period.

6.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:•Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;•Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company’s own models with estimates and assumptions.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
July 31, 2022January 30, 2022in millions Level 1Level 2Level 3Level 1Level 2Level 3Derivative agreements – assets$— $13 $— $— $58 $— Derivative agreements – liabilities— (529)— — (249)— Total$— $(516)$— $— $(191)$—
The fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using an income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the respective interest rate or foreign currency forward curves and discount rates. Our derivative instruments are discussed further in Note 4.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement for the assessment of impairment. We did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the three and six months ended July 31, 2022 or August 1, 2021.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and short-term debt approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of DirectorsThe Home Depot, Inc.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of July 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, and stockholders’ equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended July 31, 2022 and August 1, 2021, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended July 31, 2022 and August 1, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated interim financial information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 23, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following table presents quarter to date and year to date highlights of our financial performance:
dollars in millions, except per share dataThree Months EndedSix Months EndedJuly 31,2022August 1,2021July 31,2022August 1,2021Net sales$43,792 $41,118 $82,700 $78,618 Net earnings5,173 4,807 9,404 8,952 Diluted earnings per share$5.05 $4.53 $9.13 $8.38 Net cash provided by operating activities$7,182 $9,947 Proceeds from long-term debt, net of discounts3,957 — Repayments of long-term debt2,366 1,434 Repurchases of common stock3,962 6,905
We reported net sales of $43.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Net earnings were $5.2 billion, or $5.05 per diluted share. For the first six months of fiscal 2022, net sales were $82.7 billion and net earnings were $9.4 billion, or $9.13 per diluted share.We did not open or close any stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, resulting in a store count of 2,316 at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As of July 31, 2022, a total of 311 stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, sales per retail square foot were $700.62, and for the first six months of fiscal 2022, sales per retail square foot were $661.27. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.5 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 5.7 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was driven by an increase in average inventory levels during the first half of fiscal 2022 resulting from strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and to pull forward merchandise for events in the second half of fiscal 2022 in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption, as well as continued investment in our new supply chain facilities and carry over of some spring seasonal inventory.We generated $7.2 billion of cash flow from operations and issued $4.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, during the first six months of fiscal 2022. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $4.0 billion for share repurchases and $3.9 billion for dividends. In addition, we repaid $2.4 billion of long-term debt and $496 million of net short-term debt and funded $1.4 billion in capital expenditures. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 45.6% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 44.7% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).

(3)Sales per retail square foot represents annualized sales divided by retail store square footage. Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company’s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations.
Sales
We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.Net Sales. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $2.7 billion, or 6.5%, to $43.8 billion from $41.1 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in comparable customer transactions. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $129 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Online sales, which consist of sales generated through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 13.9% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and grew by 12.0% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in online sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was a result of customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms and reflects our ongoing investments to enhance these platforms and related fulfillment capabilities, which support our interconnected retail strategy. Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.Total comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 5.8%, reflecting a 9.0% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 3.1% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand for new and innovative products. While comparable customer transactions were negative during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, transactions improved compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as spring broke across the country. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Our Building Materials, Plumbing, Millwork, Paint, and Hardware departments posted comparable sales above the Company average.

Gross Profit
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 6.0% to $14.5 billion from $13.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 33.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by investments in our supply chain network and higher product and transportation costs offset by the benefit from higher retail prices.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $224 million, or 3.5%, to $6.7 billion from $6.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 15.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 15.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment and strong expense management, partially offset by wage investments for hourly associates and increased operational costs, including investments designed to drive efficiencies in our stores.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $23 million, or 3.9%, to $616 million from $593 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.4% for the second quarter of both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business.
Interest and Other, net
Interest and other, net, was $379 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $321 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Interest and other, net, as a percentage of net sales was 0.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 0.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting higher interest expense due to higher debt balances during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, partially offset by leverage from a positive comparable sales environment.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 23.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Diluted Earnings per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $5.05 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $4.53 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in diluted earnings per share was driven by higher net earnings during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as lower diluted shares due to share repurchases.

Comparable Sales. Total comparable sales for the first six months of fiscal 2022 increased 4.1%, reflecting a 10.0% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 5.7% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the first six months of fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand for new and innovative products. The decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of cycling favorable weather and government stimulus during the first six months of fiscal 2021.During the first six months of fiscal 2022, 12 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales, led by Plumbing, Building Materials, Millwork, and Paint when compared to the first six months of fiscal 2021.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.
Return on Invested Capital
We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):

(1)Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At July 31, 2022, we had $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $862 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations.In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. For fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.65 to $1.90 per share. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends of $3.9 billion to shareholders. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $20.0 billion share repurchase authorization, of which $5.8 billion remained available as of July 31, 2022. In August 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the May 2021 authorization and does not have a prescribed expiration date. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, we had cash payments of $4.0 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases.

DEBT
In July 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. All of our short-term borrowings in the first six months of fiscal 2022 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.7 billion. In connection with our program, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks. In July 2022, we also expanded the borrowing capacity under these back-up facilities from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion, by entering into a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2023. These facilities replaced our previously existing five-year $2.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2023, and our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2022. At July 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $539 million, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In March 2022, we issued $4.0 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, we repaid an aggregate of $2.25 billion of senior notes.The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.
CASH FLOWS SUMMARY
Operating Activities
Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.8 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2022 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2021, primarily driven by changes in working capital, slightly offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was primarily impacted by higher merchandise inventories, along with the timing of vendor payments. The increase in inventory was primarily due to inflation, along with strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and to pull forward merchandise for events in the second half of fiscal 2022 in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption, as well as continued investment in our new supply chain facilities and carry over of some spring seasonal inventory.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities increased by $3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2021, primarily resulting from increased capital expenditures, partially offset by cash paid for an acquired business during the first six months of fiscal 2021.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2022 primarily reflected $4.0 billion of share repurchases, $3.9 billion of cash dividends paid, $2.4 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $496 million of net repayments of short-term debt, partially offset by $4.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt. Cash used in financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $6.9 billion of share repurchases, $3.5 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.4 billion of repayments of long-term debt.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We are also exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, we may experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks, including the instruments we use to manage our exposure to such risks, from those disclosed in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Under the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 31, 2022. We are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative, which includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems. We plan to continue to migrate additional business processes over the course of the next few years and have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as the transformation continues.Except as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES
During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we issued 2,883 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SEC’s Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we credited 1,093 deferred stock units to participant accounts under the Restoration Plan pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans.

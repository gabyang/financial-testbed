NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)



Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 29, 2017 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017.

Significant Accounting Policies

For a description of significant accounting policies, see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are both 52-week years. The second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were both 13-week quarters.

Reclassifications

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update which requires the recognition of income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. We elected to early adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 30, 2017. Upon adoption of this guidance, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the first day of fiscal year 2018 to decrease retained earnings by $28 million, with a corresponding decrease to prepaid taxes that had not been previously recognized in income tax expense.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months. The update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. Under existing guidance, operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.The FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. While we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new standard, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.



Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized as inventory, as follows:

Equity Award Activity

The following is a summary of equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:

(1)Includes PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest if the corporate financial performance maximum target level for fiscal year 2018 is achieved. Depending on the actual level of achievement of the corporate performance target at the end of fiscal year 2018, the PSUs issued could be up to 0.6 million shares.(2)Includes market-based PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum target for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to the respective TSRs of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during a 3-year measurement period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 0.1 million shares.Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $10 million and $39 million, respectively. Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $5 million and $17 million, respectively. The following summarizes the aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense and estimated weighted average amortization period as of July 30, 2017 and January 29, 2017:

Note 3 – Net Income Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

(1)Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.(2)Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.0480 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Warrants have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of $26.9876 per share. All outstanding Warrants were terminated during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.For the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, our average stock price was $144.57 and $124.89, respectively, which exceeded both the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted strike price, causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a dilutive impact for these periods.The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transactions, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as this effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Convertible Notes, the shares delivered to us under the Note Hedges will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Convertible Notes.In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we entered into an agreement to terminate 63 million Warrants and, in consideration, we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we entered into a second agreement to terminate the remaining 12 million Warrants outstanding and, in consideration, we delivered a total of 10 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank.






Please refer to Note 11 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)

Note 4 – Income Taxes

We recognized income tax expense of $101 million and $130 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively, and $56 million and $89 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017, respectively.  Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018 was 14.8% and 10.7%, respectively, and 17.6% and 15.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year primarily reflects the recognition of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and a proportional decrease in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax.Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 of 10.7% and 15.9%, respectively, were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.For the first half of fiscal year 2018, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017.While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of July 30, 2017, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.






Note 5 - Marketable Securities

All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax, and net realized gains and losses recorded in total other income (expense) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of July 30, 2017. Based on our quarterly impairment review, we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of July 30, 2017.The following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of July 30, 2017 and January 29, 2017:

The gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were due to changes in interest rates. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on investment securities as of July 30, 2017 are temporary in nature. Currently, we have the intent and ability to hold our investments with impairment indicators until maturity. Net realized gains and losses were not significant for the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.The amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities, which are primarily debt instruments, are classified as available-for-sale as of July 30, 2017 and January 29, 2017 and are shown below by contractual maturity:

Note 6 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 assets for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. We did not have any investments classified as Level 3 as of July 30, 2017.

Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments

In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building that entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates. The objective of this interest rate swap is to mitigate variability in the benchmark interest rate on the first $200 million of existing operating lease financing payments. This interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge, will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, and will terminate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gains or losses on this swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will subsequently be recorded in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occur.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts as of July 30, 2017 was not significant.We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency. These foreign currency forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of total other income (expense) and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in total other income (expense).The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts:



Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 30, 2017 July 31, 2016 July 30, 2017 July 31, 2016 (In millions)Designated as cash flow hedges$89 $61 $163 $96Not designated for hedge accounting$69 $13 $120 $13

Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts, we are allowed to net settle transactions with the same counterparty, subject to applicable requirements. However, we present our derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments.


14

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)

As of July 30, 2017, the maturities of the designated foreign currency forward contracts were three months or less. We expect to realize all gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months.We formally assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment are highly effective. For the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, all derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment were determined to be highly effective and there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.The net change in unrealized gains (losses) on derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment was not significant for the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.




Note 10 - Guarantees

U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of the changes of the entity’s product warranty liabilities.

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities as of July 30, 2017 and January 29, 2017 were as follows:

July 30, January 29, 2017 2017 (In millions)Balance at beginning of period$8 $11Additions8 2Deductions(2) (5)Balance at end of period $14 $8

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered into in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Note 11 - Debt
Convertible Debt
1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $136 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and had $86 million in principal amount outstanding as of July 30, 2017. We also issued 5 million shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value and recognized a loss of $3 million on early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $164.39 on the last trading day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes as of July 30, 2017 exceeded their principal amount by approximately $619 million. As of July 30, 2017, the conversion rate was 49.8804 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes after adjusting for dividend increases (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $20.0480 per share of common stock).Through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we settled an aggregate of $1.41 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. Subsequently, we received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $62 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. Settlements of these conversion requests are expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes, and we expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note Hedges.Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 under certain circumstances. For example, during any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day, the Convertible Notes become convertible at the holders' option. As this condition was met, the Convertible Notes first became convertible at the holders' option beginning on the first day of fiscal year 2017 and continue to be convertible at the holders’ option through October 29, 2017. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes at issuance, since our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal could be fully or partially settled in cash. The liability component was assigned by estimating the fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and the liability component was assigned as the equity component. The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was valued at $1.35 billion and the initial carrying value of the equity component recorded in additional paid-in-capital was valued at $126 million. This equity component, together with the $23 million purchaser's discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of $148 million. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interest rate of 3.15%.As of July 30, 2017, the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.The following table presents the carrying value of the Convertible Notes:





July 30, January 29, 2017 2017 (In millions)1.00% Convertible Senior Notes$86 $827Unamortized debt discount (1)(2) (31)Net carrying amount$84 $796

(1) As of July 30, 2017, the remaining period over which the unamortized debt discount will be amortized is 1.3 years.

Note Hedges and Warrants

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.0480 per share and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we had received 5 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $136 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. Subsequently, we expect to receive additional shares of our common stock related to at least an additional $62 million in principal amount that is expected to settle during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.In addition, concurrent with the offering of the Convertible Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges, we entered into a separate warrant transaction. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we entered into an agreement to terminate  63 million Warrants and, in consideration, we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we entered into a second agreement to terminate the remaining 12 million Warrants outstanding and, in consideration, we delivered a total of 10 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank.



Long-Term Debt
2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026 (collectively, the Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable in March and September of each year, beginning in March 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Lease Financing Arrangement

In fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are financing this construction under an off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease arrangement. As a part of this arrangement, we leased the real property we own where the building will be constructed under a 99 year ground lease to a syndicate of banks and concurrently leased back the building under a real property lease.Under the real property lease, we pay rent, taxes, maintenance costs, utilities, insurance and other property related costs. The lease has an initial 7.5 year term expiring in December 2022, consisting of an approximately 2.5 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term. We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods, subject to approval by the banks.We have been overseeing the construction of the headquarters building. The banks committed to fund up to $380 million of costs relating to construction. Advances have been made periodically to reimburse us for construction costs we incur. Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest is capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction, we will pay rent in the form of interest. We have guaranteed the obligations under the lease held by our subsidiary.During the term of the lease, we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks’ investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent. At the end of the lease term, we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 87.5% of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building. However, under certain default circumstances, the lease guarantee may be 100% of the banks’ investment in the building plus any and all accrued but unpaid interest and all other rent due and payable under the operative agreements.The operative agreements are subject to customary default provisions, including, for example, those relating to payment and performance defaults, and events of bankruptcy. We are also subject to the financial covenant to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio not to exceed 3.5 to 1.0. If certain events of default occur and are continuing under the operative agreements, the banks may accelerate repayment of their investment under the lease.





Litigation

Polaris Innovations Limited

On May 16, 2016, Polaris Innovations Limited, or Polaris, a non-practicing entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.), filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas alleging that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe six U.S. patents relating to the control of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the six Polaris patents.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)

On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of California. The California Court has not set a trial date.On December 7, 2016, NVIDIA filed a petition for inter partes review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 7,886,122, which is asserted by Polaris in that California district court litigation. On December 19, 2016, NVIDIA filed an inter partes review request with the USPTO challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 7,124,325, another patent asserted by Polaris. On May 5, 2017, NVIDIA filed an inter partes review request with the USPTO challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 8,161,344, another patent asserted by Polaris. On May 30, 2017, NVIDIA filed an inter partes review request with the USPTO challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 6,532,505, another patent asserted by Polaris. On June 22, 2017, the USPTO instituted inter partes review of U.S Patent No. 7,886,122. On June 23, 2017, the USPTO denied institution of inter partes review of U.S. Patent No. 7,124,325. On July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed inter partes requests with the USPTO challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 8,207,976, another patent asserted by Polaris. Also on July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed inter partes requests with the USPTO for U.S. Patent No. 8,161,344 challenging the validity of further claims and an additional inter partes request for U.S. Patent No. 7,124,325. All of the patents that Polaris has asserted in the U.S. litigation are now subject to requests for inter partes review, with institution decisions forthcoming.On May 9, 2017, NVIDIA filed a Motion to Stay the California action pending final resolution of the inter partes review of U.S. Patents Nos. 7,886,122; 7,124,325; and 8,161,344.  On June 15, 2017, the Motion to Stay was granted. The action has now been stayed until December 14, 2017 pending the institution of the inter partes review of these patents.On December 30, 2016, NVIDIA received notice that Polaris had filed a complaint for patent infringement in Germany. The German case alleges infringement of European Patent No. EP1428225 and German Patent Nos. DE 10223167 and DE 1020066043668. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents. An oral hearing has been scheduled for February 21, 2019. On March 31, 2017, the German Patent Court acknowledged receipt of nullity actions filed by NVIDIA challenging the validity of EP1428225 and DE 1020066043668. On June 12, 2017, NVIDIA was notified that the nullity actions against EP1428225 and DE 1020066043668 were served on Polaris and that Polaris has filed a formal response opposing each nullity complaint. On July 14, 2017, the German Patent Court acknowledged receipt of a nullity action filed by NVIDIA challenging the validity of DE 10223167. Polaris has not yet responded to this action.





Accounting for Loss Contingencies

While there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by the other party in the above ongoing matters are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. As of July 30, 2017, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.


Note 13 - Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock.During the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, we repurchased a total of 5 million shares for $758 million and made cash dividend payments to our shareholders of $84 million and $166 million, respectively.Through July 30, 2017, we have repurchased an aggregate of 250 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $5.35 billion since the inception of the program. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of July 30, 2017, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.97 billion through December 2020.

We are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value.


Note 14 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphics architecture. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for mobile gaming and entertainment devices, as well as autonomous robots, drones and cars. We have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors. This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other charges, contributions, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Restructuring and Other Charges

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we began the wind-down of our Icera operations. No restructuring charges were recorded during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Total Other Income (Expense)

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $15 million and $12 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $31 million and $23 million during the first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities, as well as higher purchased yields. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $15 million and $12 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $31 million and $23 million during the first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.


Other, Net

Other, net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early debt conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an expense of $4 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and $21 million during the first half of fiscal year 2018, consisting primarily of $3 million and $17 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Other, net, was not significant during the second quarter or first half of fiscal year 2017.

Income Taxes

We recognized income tax expense of $101 million and $130 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively, and $56 million and $89 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 14.8% and 10.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively, and 17.6% and 15.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year primarily reflects the recognition of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and a proportional decrease in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax.

The Convertible Notes first became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on the first day of fiscal year 2017. We have utilized U.S. cash to settle an aggregate of $1.41 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we have received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $62 million in principal amount, which are expected to be settled in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements

We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are constructing a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are financing this construction under an off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease arrangement. The banks have committed to fund up to $380 million of costs relating to construction. Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction, we will pay rent in the form of interest. The lease has an initial 7.5 year term expiring in December 2022, consisting of an approximately 2.5 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term. We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods, subject to approval by the banks. During the term of the lease, we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks’ investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent. At the end of the lease term, we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 87.5% of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building. Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our operating lease financing arrangement.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of July 30, 2017, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Please refer to the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017.Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.



ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020.Through July 30, 2017, we have repurchased an aggregate of 250 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $5.35 billion since the inception of the program. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of July 30, 2017, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.97 billion through December 2020. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.The following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018:

Transactions Related to our Convertible Notes and Note Hedges

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we issued an aggregate of 5 million shares of our common stock upon settlement of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect to settle at least an aggregate of $62 million in principal amount, and issue shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value, related to the Convertible Notes that were submitted for conversion. The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes, and we expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note Hedges. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges.


Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding

We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive program. During the first half of fiscal year 2018, we withheld approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $190 million through net share settlements. Please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

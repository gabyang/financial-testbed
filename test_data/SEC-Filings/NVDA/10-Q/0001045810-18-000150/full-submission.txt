NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)



Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 28, 2018 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
Significant Accounting Policies
Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)

Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were both 13-week quarters.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted
In February 2016 and July 2018, the FASB issued accounting standards updates regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months. The FASB also recently provided a practical expedient transition method to adopt the new lease accounting requirements. We are evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements. The updates will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting Standard
Method and Impact of Adoption
On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax. Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 was not significant.
Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations
Deferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing. The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during the first nine months of fiscal year 2019:
October 28, 2018 (In millions)Balance as of January 28, 2018$68Adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of new revenue standard(5)Balance as of January 29, 201863Deferred revenue added during the period271Revenue recognized during the period(214)Balance as of October 28, 2018$120

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. As of October 28, 2018, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $237 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Refer to Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures.

Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

Depending on the actual level of the corporate performance achievement at the end of fiscal year 2019, the PSUs issued could be up to 0.3 million shares.(2)Includes the number of market-based PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum goal for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to those of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during that period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 45 thousand shares.Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $73 million and $89 million, respectively. Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $105 million and $144 million, respectively.

Note 5 – Income Taxes
We recognized an income tax benefit of $149 million and $3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense of $58 million and $189 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.8% and nominal for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense as a percentage of income before tax was 6.5% and 8.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, and a $138 million reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were nominal and 8.9%, respectively, and were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% and 33.9%, for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, and for fiscal year 2019, the reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount.In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts, or TCJA, during a measurement period not to exceed one year. The TCJA was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we have recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we reduced our provisional transition tax amount based on proposed regulations issued on August 1, 2018. We expect to complete our analysis of these provisional amounts in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 based on further guidance on accounting interpretations from the FASB and application of the law from the U.S. Department of Treasury, which may further impact our provisional estimates.The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. Under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Given the complexity of the GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating its effects and have not yet determined our accounting policy. We expect to complete our analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, as we are still evaluating the effects of the GILTI provisions, we have included tax expense related to GILTI for current-year operations in our estimated annual effective tax rate and have not provided for GILTI on deferred items.For the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, other than the aforementioned reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount.While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 28, 2018, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.

Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018.We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018:
October 28, 2018 January 28, 2018 (In millions)Designated as cash flow hedges$403 $104Not designated for hedge accounting$93 $94
As of October 28, 2018, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Note 11 - Guarantees
U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee.
Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities
We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $18 million and $15 million as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018, respectively.In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Note 12 - Debt
Long-Term Debt
2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:

Convertible Debt
1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018
In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 and we had $3 million in principal amount outstanding as of October 28, 2018. Effective August 1, 2018, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes before the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2018 regardless of conversion conditions.During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and issued 485 thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. The related loss on early conversions was not significant. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $198.29 on the last trading day of the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $31 million. As of October 28, 2018, the conversion rate was 49.95 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes.
Note Hedges
Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.02 per share and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. Through October 28, 2018, we had received 56 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.50 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies
While there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by the other parties in the above ongoing matters are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. As of October 28, 2018, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Note 15 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture. While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, or AI, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, high performance computing, or HPC, and artificial intelligence, or AI.Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year and increased 2% sequentially. GPU business revenue was $2.77 billion, up 25% from a year earlier and up 4% sequentially, reflecting growth in professional visualization, datacenter, and gaming GPUs. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and other embedded edge AI platforms - was $407 million, down 3% from a year ago and down 13% sequentially.  Gaming revenue was $1.76 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs, and down 2% sequentially as gaming GPU growth was more than offset by a seasonal decline in SOC modules for Nintendo Switch. Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.Professional visualization revenue was $305 million, up 28% from a year earlier and up 9% sequentially driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products. Datacenter revenue was $792 million, up 58% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems, with contribution from the new Turing T4 Cloud GPU. Automotive revenue of $172 million was up 19% from a year earlier and up 7% sequentially, incorporating infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies.OEM and IP revenue was $148 million, down 23% from a year ago, due to the absence of cryptocurrency mining.Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 60.4%. Gross margins increased from a year ago - reflecting our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the current quarter impact of $57 million in charges related to prior architecture components and chips following the sharp fall-off in cryptocurrency mining demand.Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $863 million, up 28% from a year earlier and up 6% sequentially, reflecting increased headcount and related costs for our growth initiatives - including gaming, professional visualization, AI, and autonomous driving.Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $1.06 billion, up 18% from a year earlier and down 9% sequentially. Net income and net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.23 billion and $1.97, respectively, up 47% and 48%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross margin. We previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2019. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through a combination of $855 million in share repurchases and $273 million in cash dividends. In November 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program for a total of $7.94 billion available through the end of December 2022. We announced a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share from $0.15 per share, to be paid with our next quarterly cash dividend on December 21, 2018, to all shareholders of record on November 30, 2018. We intend to return an additional $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, which may begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.59 billion as of October 28, 2018, compared with $7.94 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily related to third quarter stock repurchases, dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units, partially offset by operating income and changes in working capital.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of October 28, 2018, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

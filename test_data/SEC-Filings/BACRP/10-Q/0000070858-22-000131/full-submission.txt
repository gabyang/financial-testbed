Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its management may make certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.” Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation’s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation’s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation’s potential judgments, orders, settlements, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, including as a result of our participation in and execution of government programs related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states; the possibility that the Corporation's future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, and regulatory and government actions; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties involved in mortgage securitizations; the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs, and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate, inflationary and macroeconomic environment on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages on economic conditions and our business; potential losses related to the Corporation’s concentration of credit risk; the Corporation’s ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding revenue, net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of changes in or interpretations of income tax laws and regulations;  the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and any similar or related rules and regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach of the Corporation’s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns; the risks related to the transition and physical impacts of climate change; our ability to achieve environmental, social and governance goals and commitments or the impact of any changes in the Corporation’s sustainability strategy or commitments generally; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government’s debt limit or changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy; the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, including the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on U.S. and/or global financial market conditions and our business, results of operations,   financial   condition  and  prospects;  the  impact  of
Bank of America  2natural disasters, extreme weather events, military conflict (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the possible expansion of such conflict and potential geopolitical consequences), terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary.Executive SummaryBusiness OverviewThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, “the Corporation,” “we,” “us” and “our” may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our various bank and nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At September 30, 2022, the Corporation had $3.1 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 213,000 employees.As of September 30, 2022, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in the U.S., and we serve approximately 68 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 3,900 retail financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 43 million active users, including approximately 35 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business households. Our GWIM businesses, with client balances of $3.2 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.The Corporation’s website is www.bankofamerica.com, and the Investor Relations portion of our website is https://investor.bankofamerica.com. We use our website to distribute company information, including as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. We routinely post and make accessible financial and other information, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, regarding the Corporation on our website. Investors should monitor our website, including the Investor Relations portion, in addition to our press releases, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, public conference calls and webcasts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information contained on our website as referenced in this paragraph is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Recent DevelopmentsMonoline Insurance Litigation SettlementAs previously disclosed, on October 6, 2022, the Corporation and certain wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with Ambac Assurance Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Ambac”) to resolve all pending Ambac lawsuits against the Corporation and its subsidiaries previously disclosed in the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in prior SEC reports. Under the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the Corporation’s payment of $1.84 billion, Ambac, among other things, caused all pending litigation between the parties to be dismissed with prejudice, and released the Corporation and its subsidiaries from all outstanding claims related to Ambac’s issuance of bond insurance policies for certain of the Corporation’s and legacy entities’ securitized pools of residential mortgage loans. The Corporation recorded litigation expense of $354 million in the third quarter of 2022 for the portion of the settlement in excess of previously accrued amounts. For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Changes in U.S. Tax LawOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions. The tax changes included the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs, the establishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases. For more information, see Financial Highlights – Income Tax Expense on page 7.Capital ManagementIn June 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) announced the results of the 2022 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress tests, which included preliminary stress capital buffers (SCBs) that were finalized in August 2022. Based on the results, our SCB increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, resulting in a minimum Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.On October 19, 2022, the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.22 per share, payable on December 30, 2022 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2022.For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 23.Russia/Ukraine ConflictAs previously disclosed, due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there has been significant volatility in financial and commodities markets, and multiple jurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions. At September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our direct net country exposure to Russia was $461 million, $550 million and $733 million, primarily consisting of outstanding loans and leases totaling $390 million, $468 million and $686 million, respectively, and our net country exposure to Ukraine was not significant. While the Corporation’s direct exposure to Russia is limited, the potential duration, course and impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict remain uncertain and could adversely affect macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which could negatively impact the Corporation's businesses, results of operations and financial position. For more information on the Russia/Ukraine conflict, including related risks, see Recent Developments – Russia/Ukraine in the MD&A of the Corporation’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, and the Market and Geopolitical sections within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.LIBOR and Other Benchmark RatesImmediately after December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration ceased publishing British Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings. However, certain GBP and JPY LIBOR settings that became no longer representative of the underlying market that such rates sought to measure are being published using a modified calculation (i.e., on a “synthetic” basis). The remaining USD LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023.The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide transition program with respect to LIBOR and other impacted benchmark rates. The Corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to limited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory guidance issued by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Corporation also continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to transition away from impacted benchmarks, and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products.As previously disclosed, the Corporation has remediated a significant majority of its notional contractual exposure to LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings that will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023 (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to alternative reference rates (ARRs), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for USD LIBOR, that are based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance, and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms). The remaining non-remediated USD LIBOR exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans, represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation and requires active dialogue with clients to modify such contracts. For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation is assessing and planning to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022 at the federal level in the U.S. and subject to the issuance of final implementing rules by the Federal Reserve,  and other relevant legislation, to transition such exposure to ARRs.For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A and Item 1A.

For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48. Net income was $7.1 billion and $20.4 billion, or $0.81 and $2.34 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022  compared  to  $7.7 billion and $25.0 billion, or $0.85 and $2.75 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income. In addition, the nine-month period in the prior year included a positive income tax adjustment related to the revaluation of U.K. net deferred tax assets.Total assets decreased $96.5 billion from December 31, 2021 to $3.1 trillion primarily driven by lower cash and cash equivalents due to deposit outflows related to the rising interest rate environment and lower debt securities, partially offset by loan growth across commercial and consumer products, as well as higher trading account assets and derivative assets to support Global Markets activity.   Total liabilities decreased $96.0 billion from December 31, 2021 to $2.8 trillion primarily driven by deposit outflows related to the rising interest rate environment and customer tax payments.Shareholders’ equity decreased $542 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, as well as returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases, partially offset by net income and the issuance of preferred stock.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased $2.7 billion to $13.8 billion, and $6.3 billion to $37.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 38 basis points (bps) to 2.06 percent, and 21 bps to 1.87 percent for the same periods. The increase in net interest income for the three-month period was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and loan growth, partially offset by lower deposits and securities. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily driven by lower premium amortization expense, loan growth and higher interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest  Rate  Risk  Management  for the Banking Book on page 45.

Noninterest income decreased $935 million to $10.7 billion and decreased $2.9 billion to $32.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The following highlights the significant changes.●    Service charges decreased $462 million and $578 million primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges.●    Investment and brokerage services decreased $441 million and $244 million primarily driven by lower market valuations.●    Investment banking fees decreased $1.0 billion and $2.8 billion primarily driven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and debt issuance fees and lower advisory fees.●    Market making and similar activities increased $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion primarily driven by improved performance across macro products in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and derivative products in Equities.●    Other income decreased $84 million and $876 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses increased $1.5 billion to $898 million and $5.6 billion to $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties. For the same periods in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.Bank of America  6

Noninterest expense increased $863 million to $15.3 billion and $895 million to $45.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in the three-month period was primarily due to higher investments in people and technology and the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation, partially offset by lower net COVID-19 related costs. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month period, as well as expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters during the second quarter of 2022.
Income Tax Expense
Table 4Income Tax ExpenseThree Months Ended September 30Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions)2022202120222021Income before income taxes$8,301 $8,950 $23,072 $26,158 Income tax expense1,219 1,259 2,676 1,193 Effective tax rate14.7 %14.1 %11.6 %4.6 %
Changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods a year ago were primarily driven by changes in our recurring preference benefits. Also included in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change further discussed in this section. The majority of our recurring tax preference benefits consists of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing, where the recurring tax credits are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and wind and solar energy investments, where the tax credits are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced if electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), as further discussed below. Absent ESG tax credits and unusual items, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent.On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions, including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs. In particular, partnerships are no longer limited to an ITC, but can now elect a PTC for solar energy production facilities placed in service after December 31, 2021. As a result, the Corporation changed its estimated impact of solar-related tax credits and reversed the impact of certain solar investment tax credits recognized in the first half of 2022, which increased income tax expense by $152 million in the third quarter of 2022. If there is a change in the expected tax credit election, an income tax adjustment will be recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs. Other notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax (AMT) on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases, both of which are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The tax law changes for the new AMT permit business credits, including those from ESG investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, to offset potential AMT liability. The Corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two U.S. tax law changes and does not expect the changes will have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate. On June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which increased the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $2.0 billion with a corresponding write-up of U.K. net deferred tax assets, which reflected a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate.Supplemental Financial DataNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:●    Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●    Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●    Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 9.For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 101. Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 5 and Table 5 on page 9.For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 22. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments’ operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Banking ResultsThree-Month ComparisonNet income for Consumer Banking increased $27 million to $3.1 billion due to higher revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $1.3 billion to $7.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and the benefits of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness. Noninterest income decreased $225 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes.The provision for credit losses increased $491 million to $738 million primarily driven by loan growth in the current-year period compared to the prior-year period that benefited from an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $539 million to $5.1 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including marketing, technology and compensation and benefits expenses, as well as increased client activity.The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, down from 31 percent, primarily driven by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income for Consumer Banking increased $172 million to $8.9 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $3.2 billion to $21.6 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income decreased $405 million to $6.3 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes and lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher other service charges and card income due to increased client activity.The provision for credit losses increased $2.1 billion to $1.0 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook in the current-year period compared to a benefit in the prior-year period due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $429 million to $15.0 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization and the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation in the prior-year period.The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, unchanged from the prior-year period.DepositsThree-Month ComparisonNet income for Deposits increased $364 million to $1.8 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.3 billion to $5.0 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $257 million to $728 million primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes.Noninterest expense increased $417 million to $3.1 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity.Average deposits increased $69.5 billion to $1.1 trillion primarily due to net inflows of $38.8 billion in checking and $33.3 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income for Deposits increased $1.5 billion to $4.8 billion primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $3.0 billion to $13.5 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income decreased $392 million to $2.4 billion primarily due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion.Noninterest expense increased $415 million to $9.2 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization in the prior-year period.Average deposits increased $100.6 billion to $1.1 trillion primarily due to net inflows of $58.4 billion in checking and $42.2 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth.The table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

For more information about Global Banking, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Three-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Banking decreased $513 million to $2.0 billion driven by higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue.Net interest income increased $1.1 billion to $3.3 billion primarily due to the benefits of higher interest rates and loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit balances.Noninterest income decreased $795 million to $2.3 billion driven by lower investment banking fees, income from ESG investment activities and treasury service charges.The provision for credit losses increased $951 million to $170 million primarily driven by a dampening macroeconomic outlook compared to a benefit in the provision for credit losses of $781 million in the prior-year period due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.Noninterest expense increased $117 million to $2.7 billion primarily due to continued investments in the business, including strategic hiring.The return on average allocated capital was 18 percent, down from 24 percent, due to lower net income and higher allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.Nine-Month Comparison Net income for Global Banking decreased $1.9 billion to $5.3 billion driven by higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue.Net interest income increased $2.2 billion to $8.3 billion primarily due to the benefits of higher interest rates and loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $1.3 billion to $7.5 billion driven by lower investment banking fees and valuation adjustments on leveraged loans.The provision for credit losses increased $3.2 billion to $492 million primarily driven by a dampening macroeconomic outlook and loan growth as well as a reserve build in the current-year period for our Russian exposure, compared to a benefit in the provision for credit losses of $2.7 billion in the prior-year period due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.Bank of America  18Noninterest expense increased $218 million to $8.1 billion, primarily due to continued investments in the business, partially offset by an acceleration of expenses due to incentive compensation award changes in the prior-year period.The return on average allocated capital was 16 percent, down from 22 percent, due to lower net income and higher allocated capital.

(1)Prior periods have been revised to conform to current-period presentation. Business Lending revenue increased $217 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to the benefits of loan growth and higher interest rates, partially offset by lower income from ESG investment activities. Business Lending revenue increased $841 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to the benefits of loan growth and higher interest rates.Global Transaction Services revenue increased $858 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit balances and treasury service charges. Global Transaction Services revenue increased $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 driven by higher interest rates.Average loans and leases increased 20 percent and 16 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022  due to higher client demand. Average deposits decreased seven percent during the three months ended September 30, 2022 due to declines in domestic and international balances, and increased one percent during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to portfolio growth.Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and  commercial  clients  that  are  executed  and distributed by Global  Markets.   To   provide  a  complete  discussion   of  our consolidated investment banking fees, the table below presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking.

Bank of America  20Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Except as otherwise noted below, the following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets, including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8.Three-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Markets increased $139 million to $1.1 billion. Net DVA losses were $14 million compared to losses of $20 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $135 million to $1.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven  by lower noninterest expense.Revenue decreased $36 million to $4.5 billion primarily driven by lower investment banking fees, largely offset by higher sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $478 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $472 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in FICC.Noninterest expense decreased $229 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021.Average total assets increased $43.0 billion to $847.9 billion driven by loan growth, higher derivative balances due to a strong U.S. dollar and higher interest rates, as well as growth in commodities activity. The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, unchanged from the prior-year period, reflecting higher net income offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Markets decreased $210 million to $3.7 billion. Net DVA gains were $213 million compared to losses of $56 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $415 million to $3.5 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.Revenue decreased $1.2 billion to $14.3 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Sales and trading revenue increased $711 million and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $442 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in both FICC and Equities.Noninterest expense decreased $901 million to $9.2 billion primarily due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion and an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes in the prior-year period.Average total assets increased $82.2 billion to $857.7 billion driven by loan growth and commodities activity in FICC as well as higher balances in Equities. Period-end total assets increased $101.0 billion from December 31, 2021 to $848.8 billion driven by higher derivative balances due to a strong U.S. dollar and higher interest rates, higher levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate client activity, and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Equities.The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent, down from 14 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. Sales and Trading RevenueFor a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

FICC net DVA gains (losses) were $(15) million and $205 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to losses of $16 million and $53 million for the same periods in 2021. Equities net DVA gains were $1 million and $8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to losses of $4 million and $3 million for the same periods in 2021.Three-Month ComparisonFICC revenue increased $542 million driven by improved performance across macro products, partially offset by a weaker trading performance in credit and mortgage products. Equities revenue decreased $70 million driven by lower client activity in Asia and a weaker trading performance in cash, partially offset by increased client activity in derivatives.Nine-Month ComparisonFICC revenue increased $314 million driven by improved trading performance across interest rate and currency products, partially offset by gains in commodities in the prior-year period for a weather-related event and a weaker trading environment for credit products in the current-year period. Equities revenue increased $128 million driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives, partially offset by a weaker trading performance in cash.

(1)In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders’ equity. Average allocated assets were $1.1 trillion for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $1.1 trillion for both periods in 2021, and period-end allocated assets were $1.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.All Other primarily consists of asset and liability management (ALM) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Three-Month ComparisonThe net loss of All Other increased $226 million to a loss of $281 million primarily due to higher noninterest expense and a lower income tax benefit, partially offset by higher revenue.Revenue increased $246 million primarily driven by lower valuation adjustments.Noninterest expense increased $364 million primarily driven by higher litigation expense due to the legacy monoline insurance litigation settlement and the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by decreases in other expenses. The income tax benefit decreased $118 million primarily due to the impact of lower levels of income tax credits associated with ESG investment activities, which were impacted by enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the third quarter of 2022. For more information, see Financial Highlights –  Income   Tax   Expense  on  page  7.   Both  periods  included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income decreased $3.0 billion to a loss of $963 million primarily due to a lower income tax benefit and higher noninterest expense.Noninterest expense increased $868 million primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion and expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters during the second quarter of 2022. The income tax benefit decreased $2.1 billion primarily due to the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change.  For more information, see Financial Highlights – Income Tax Expense on page 7. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Managing RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Bank of America  22Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our risk appetite provides a common set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and ensure that the Corporation’s risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually. For more information about the Corporation’s risks, including those related to the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, our SCB increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. In October 2021, the Board renewed the Corporation’s $25 billion common stock repurchase program previously announced in April 2021. The Board’s authorization replaced the previous program. As with the April 2021 authorization, the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation’s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board’s authorizations, during the third quarter of 2022, we repurchased $450 million of common stock, predominantly offsetting shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2022, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach.Minimum Capital RequirementsIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, the Corporation’s SCB increased to 3.4 percent, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2022, the Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio of 11.0 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its new CET1 capital ratio requirement that was effective October 1, 2022. Our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches remains unchanged at 9.5 percent.The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024 unless its surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.

(1)Capital ratios as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard.(2)The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB or the capital conservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.(3)Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(4)Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.At September 30, 2022, CET1 capital was $175.6 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion from December 31, 2021, due to earnings, partially offset by dividends, an increase in net unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), and common stock repurchases. Tier 1 capital increased $8.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital as well as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $7.7 billion primarily  due  to  the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2022, decreased $18.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $1,599 billion primarily due to lower client activity in Global Markets and a decrease in debt securities, partially offset by loan growth. Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2022 decreased $48.2 billion primarily due to lower debt securities, driven by lower deposits, partially offset by loan growth.

(BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2022, BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.1 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $16.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.1 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At September 30, 2022, MLPCC’s regulatory net capital of $7.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At September 30, 2022, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $5.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $158 million.Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2022, MLI’s capital resources were $33.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $12.1 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2022, BofASE's capital resources were $7.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.2 billion. In addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at September 30, 2022 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. Liquidity RiskFunding and Liquidity Risk ManagementOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding

and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
NB Holdings Corporation
The parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).  We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent company assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets
Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.Our bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $349 billion and $322 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash  deposited  at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at

bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $618 billion and $617 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 123 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.
Liquidity Stress Analysis
We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Stable Funding Ratio
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At September 30, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement.

Bank of America  28Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which totaled $1.9 trillion and $2.1 trillion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions.Long-term DebtDuring  the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we issued $56.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $41.5 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $5.9 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $8.6 billion of other debt, which is primarily structured liabilities.During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $24.3 billion consisting of $13.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $7.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.1 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2022.

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we issued $8.6 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, asset quality continued to improve. Excluding losses associated with non-core mortgage sales, our net charge-off ratio remained near historic lows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased, which was partially  offset  by  an increase in reservable criticized exposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around the pandemic has largely dissipated, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and  the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience, and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the U.S. unemployment rate continued to decline and home prices increased compared to the same period a year ago; however, inflationary pressures continued to persist. Net charge-offs increased $130 million to $459 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and decreased $211 million to $1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in the three-month period was primarily due to overdrafts charged off in other consumer, and the decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to lower credit card losses, as loss rates remain near historic lows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, nonperforming loans declined primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the first quarter of 2022.Bank of America  30The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $153 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $6.9 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 17 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.

(1)Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential mortgage includes $321 million and $444 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $106 million and $190 million of loans on which interest was still accruing.(2)Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $50.7 billion and $48.5 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $52.6 billion and $51.1 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.(3)For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4)Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $8 million and $21 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.Table 18 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2022. Approximately 52 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was  in  Consumer  Banking  and  45 percent  was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $7.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as originations were partially offset by paydowns and loan sales. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.9 billion and $12.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which both had FHA insurance of $2.2 billion, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. Table 19 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 65 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $146 million.Net recoveries of $3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same period in 2021. Net charge-offs of $73 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $90 million compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to loan sales that occurred in the second quarter of 2022. Of the $217.1 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2022, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at September 30, 2022. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2022, $37 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $720 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2022, $213 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $84 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 95 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(1)Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Home Equity At September 30, 2022, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.At September 30, 2022, 82 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, nine percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased Bank of America  32$1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $11.4 billion and $12.2 billion, or 43 percent and 44 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2022, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien  position  and  where  we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.6 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $41.4 billion and $40.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The HELOC utilization rate was 38 percent and 39 percent at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Table 21 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics.

(1)Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2)Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $98 million to $532 million at September 30, 2022, primarily driven by loan sales. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2022, $277 million, or 52 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $189 million, or 36 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $74 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.Net recoveries decreased $16 million to $18 million and $21 million to $72 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Of the $26.8 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2022, as shown in Table 21, 14 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $5.5 billion at September 30, 2022. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early   stage   delinquencies   and   nonperforming  status  whencompared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2022, $47 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2022, $380 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, 21 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent and 10 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $5.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $87.3 billion primarily driven by increased purchase volumes, partially offset by the transfer of a $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale that was sold in October 2022. Net charge-offs increased $7 million to $328 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and decreased $495 million to $948 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, as loss rates remained near historic lows. In addition, the nine-month period in the prior year included charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $205 million, and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $60 million. Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $367.4 billion at September 30, 2022 from $361.2 billion at December 31, 2021.Table 23 presents certain state concentrations for the credit card portfolio.

Direct/Indirect ConsumerAt September 30, 2022, 47 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational  vehicle  lending) and 53 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in  the  direct/indirect  portfolio  increased $3.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $107.2 billion driven by growth in our auto portfolio and client demand for liquidity in securities-based lending.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $229 million to $2.8 billion primarily due to decreases from loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified as TDRs during the first quarter of 2022. At September 30, 2022, $639 million, or 23 percent, of nonperforming  loans  were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2022, $1.7 billion, or 63 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties increased $24 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $125 million. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.Bank of America  34

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer’s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $608 million and $672 million, of which $533 million and $599 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 31, 34 and 37 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 39.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Commercial Credit PortfolioDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict, all direct exposure to Russian counterparties was downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected credit losses have been incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $38.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Banking. This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. small business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to stabilize as pandemic-impacted sectors are recovering. However, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing  disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. Demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at September 30, 2022, as asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties were offset by a dampening macroeconomic outlook, loan growth and a reserve build related to Russian exposure. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $65.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $718.6 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases and derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 57 percent and 56 percent at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Table 27 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

U.S. commercial loans increased $29.4 billion, or nine percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by Global Banking. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $1.5 billion, or 13 percent, driven by decreases across a broad range of industries.Non-U.S. CommercialAt September 30, 2022, 66 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 33 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM. Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $9.8 billion, or nine percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as loan growth in Global Banking and Global Markets was partially offset by foreign currency valuation adjustments on foreign currency-denominated loans. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $101 million, or four percent, due to downgrades for direct exposure to Russian counterparties. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41. For more information on the Russia/Ukraine conflict, see Recent Developments on page 3.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $4.9 billion, or eight percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $68.0 billion due to new originations outpacing paydowns and increased utilizations under existing credit facilities. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $3.0 billion, or 40 percent, primarily driven by Hotels due to improving vacancy rates and reduced travel restrictions. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent and 21 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in certain geographic regions and property types of the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset  officers  and  the  pursuit  of  loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Table 31 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and included $1.5 billion and $4.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The decline of $3.2 billion in PPP loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to repayment of the loans by the SBA under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 54 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and represented all of the net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 100 percent and 96 percent for the same periods in 2021. The increase of $165 million in accruing past due 90 days or more for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was driven by PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA.Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 32 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $355 million to $1.2 billion. At September 30, 2022, 98 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 56 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.Bank of America  38

U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not  classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Commercial TDRs increased $799 million, or 42 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to commercial real estate loans that were modified as TDRs during the first half of the year.

For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Risk Mitigation. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $71.2 billion, or six percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Global commercial banks and Financial markets infrastructure (clearinghouses).For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration   with   committed   exposure   of   $172.5 billion, increased $35.6 billion, or 26 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which was primarily driven by investment-grade exposures.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $98.6 billion, increased $2.4 billion, or two percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 37.Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $89.4 billion, increased $5.2 billion, or six percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. While the U.S. and global economies have shown signs of relief from the pandemic, uncertainty remains as a result of geopolitical and inflationary pressures, and a number of industries will likely continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions.

(1)Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.(2)Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.(3)Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.
Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.1 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net losses of $56 million and gains of $66 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net losses of $18 million and $86 million for the same periods in 2021. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 40. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 44.Tables 35 and 36 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Bank of America  40For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 37 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2022. These exposures accounted for 89 percent  of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by increases in Japan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and India, partially offset by reductions in France, Canada and Australia.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at September 30, 2022 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $58.0 billion, which represents a $3.0 billion increase from December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by net counterparty exposure with financial institutions, partially offset by a  reduction  in deposits  with  the  central  bank. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $33.5 billion at September 30, 2022, a $280 million decrease from December 31, 2021. The reduction was driven by a decrease in exposure with financial institutions and corporates, offset by an increase in deposits with the central bank.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses decreased $26 million from December 31, 2021 to $13.8 billion at September 30, 2022, which included a $171 million reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio and a $145 million reserve increase related to the commercial portfolio. The decrease in the allowance was primarily driven by asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties, partially offset by reserve builds related to loan growth, a dampening macroeconomic outlook and Russian exposure.Table 38 presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(1)Ratios are calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2)Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $864 million and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $520 million and $1.5 billion compared to $463 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2021.  During the three months ended September 30, 2022, net charge-offs increased $57 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to overdrafts charged off in other consumer. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net charge-offs decreased $398 million, or 21 percent, primarily driven by lower credit card losses, as loss rates remained near historic lows. The provision for credit losses increased $1.5 billion to an expense of $898 million, and $5.6 billion to an expense of $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties. For the same periods in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $641 million to an expense of $722 million and $2.5 billion to an expense of $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $881 million to an expense of $176 million and $3.0 billion to an expense of $304 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021.Table 39 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Table 40 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which  is  the  combination of  the  total  covered  positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 40 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.Table 40 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 using a 99 percent confidence level as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The amounts disclosed in Table 40 and Table 41 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior quarter remained relatively unchanged.

Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 41 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.

BacktestingThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management – Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2022 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 85 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.


Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book
The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 42 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Table 43 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, particularly in low rate environments.During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end and short-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 23.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in

our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book  section  and  are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 43. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in  accounting  hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation’s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair value of MSR, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and
Bank of America  46losses on the hedge portfolio, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Climate Risk ManagementClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. These changes and events can have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as transition risk and physical risk. These risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. The impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers’ operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational and/or litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment. Physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. In addition, it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people.In 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal) and set 2030 emissions targets for our operations and supply chain. In connection with our Net Zero Goal, we committed to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing, energy, and power generation  (2030 Targets). In our September 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report, we disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our 2030 Targets.In line with our participation in the Net Zero Banking Alliance, we plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we expect to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024. These reduction targets are intended to align with the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions 2050 global pathway to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Achieving our climate--related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, will require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies,  including  those  that  improve  the  cost  of capital for   net   zero   transition  and  better  emissions  data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the relevant periods presented herein, and are not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the near-term.For more information on our governance framework and climate risk management process, see the Managing Risk and Climate Risk Management sections in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Other of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about climate-related matters and the Corporation’s climate-related goals and commitments, including our plans to achieve our Net Zero Goal and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporation’s website and the 2021 Annual Report to shareholders available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. The contents of the Corporation’s website and the 2021 Annual Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.The foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2021 Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.

Bank of America  52Bank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include the Corporation’s interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The nature of the Corporation’s business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results, have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet AdoptedHedge Accounting The FASB issued a new accounting standard effective on January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted, that makes targeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge accounting guidance for closed portfolios of financial assets. Upon adoption, the application of these hedge strategies would be applied prospectively.Financial Instruments – Credit LossesThe FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for expected credit losses by removing the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and enhancing certain disclosures. The amendments are effective on January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The effects of these changes on the Corporation’s financial statements are not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Offsetting of DerivativesThe Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. For more information, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Securities Financing Agreements, Collateral and Restricted Cash.

Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).Fair Value HedgesThe table below summarizes information related to fair value hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $22.0 billion and $21.1 billion, of which $9.2 billion and $6.9 billion was designated in the last-of-layer hedging relationship. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the cumulative adjustment associated with these hedging relationships was a decrease of $488 million and $172 million.(4)Carrying value represents amortized cost.

Cash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe table below summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Of the $12.8 billion after-tax net loss ($17.0 billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at September 30, 2022, losses of $3.7 billion after-tax ($4.9 billion pretax) related to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant.

Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through DerivativesThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of the transferred securities was $4.6 billion and $5.0 billion.Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).

Credit DerivativesThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. For more information on credit derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are summarized in the table below.

The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.Credit-related notes in the preceding table include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralCertain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $120.0 billion and $91.4 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $85.8 billion and $79.3 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. For more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.At September 30, 2022, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $4.0 billion, including $2.5 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate   certain   contracts,   or   the  Corporation  or  certain

subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.
The table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at September 30, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.

The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $9.7 billion and $10.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.Nonperforming Loans and LeasesCommercial nonperforming loans decreased to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022 from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Consumer nonperforming loans decreased to $2.8 billion at September 30, 2022 from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2021 primarily  due  to  decreases  from  consumer  real  estate  loansales, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified in TDRs during the first quarter of 2022. The following table presents the Corporation’s nonperforming loans and leases, including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Nonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For more information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Credit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which measures the carrying value of the Corporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of financing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at September 30, 2022, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an additional credit decision after origination or through a TDR.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, commercial credit quality showed signs of stabilization. Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased to $17.7 billion at September 30, 2022 from $22.4 billion (to 2.88 percent from 3.91 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2021, which was broad-based across industries.Troubled Debt RestructuringsConsumer Real EstateModifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.Consumer real estate loans of $224 million that have been discharged   in   Chapter   7   bankruptcy   with   no   change   in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at September 30, 2022, of which $56 million were classified as nonperforming and $38 million were loans fully insured. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $125 million and $101 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $946 million and $1.1 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation reclassified $151 million and $33 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The table below presents the September 30, 2022 and 2021 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had previously been classified as TDRs and were modified again during the period.

Credit Card and Other ConsumerThe Corporation seeks to assist customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer’s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. The table below provides information on the Corporation’s Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the September 30, 2022 and 2021 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 12 percent of new credit card TDRs and 20 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the Corporation’s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $745 million and $1.7 billion compared to $213 million and $1.1 billion for the same periods in 2021. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had commitments to lend $347 million and $283 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $117 million and $262 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Loans Held-for-saleThe Corporation had LHFS of $7.6 billion and $15.6 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $27.8 billion and $27.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $18.7 billion and $27.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by the transfer of a $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale that was sold in October 2022, and $804 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Accrued Interest ReceivableAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $3.0 billion and $2.2 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation reversed $81 million and $241 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan compared to $87 million and $369 million for the same periods in 2021.For the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, interest and fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The September 30, 2022 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic outlooks that included a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, a moderate recession scenario, a downside scenario to account for persistent inflation and interest rates at levels above what is factored into the baseline, and a tail risk scenario.  In addition, an upside scenario considers the potential for improvement in the consensus outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be above five percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 and fall just below five percent by the end of 2024. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to grow at 0.2 percent and 1.5 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. While asset quality continues to improve and the pandemic appears to have largely dissipated, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. As such, the Corporation has factored the aforementioned uncertainties into its allowance for credit losses.The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2022 was $13.8 billion, a decrease of $26 million compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties, partially offset by reserve builds related to loan growth, a dampening macroeconomic outlook and Russian exposure. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $85 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $59 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to $191 million in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase of $20 million in the credit card and other consumer portfolio, and an increase of $145 million in the commercial portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased $1.5 billion to an expense of $898 million, and $5.6 billion to an expense of $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties. For the same periods in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.Bank of America  74

Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $56.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 driven by commercial loans,   which  increased  $40.9 billion,  driven  by  broad-based growth, and  consumer loans, which increased $15.4 billion, primarily driven by residential mortgage and credit card. The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the table below.

NOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its customers’ financing and investing needs. The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. For more information on the Corporation’s use of VIEs and related maximum loss exposure, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 – Securities or Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities.The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 or the year ended December 31, 2021 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $908 million and $968 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties. Except as described in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

(1)The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the government-sponsored enterprises or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.(2)A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $5 million and $35 million net of hedges, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and compared to $24 million and $97 million for the same periods in 2021, are not included in the table above.(3)The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $102.6 billion and $129.6 billion at September 30, 2022 and 2021. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $71 million and $215 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $101 million and $318 million for the same periods in 2021. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for  others and loans held for investment, were $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion  at  September 30, 2022  and December 31, 2021. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $22 million and $585 million, with no significant deconsolidations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.The following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(1)For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies.(2)At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion of seller’s interest.
(3)The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).

77 Bank of America


Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller’s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts. Senior debt securities totaling $1.0 billion were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $6.5 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. There were $161 million of subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $5.3 billion and $19.5 billion of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $5.9 billion and $20.6 billion for the same periods in 2021. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $670 million and $2.4 billion compared to $1.0 billion and $1.6 billion, of which substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets for both periods and categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $3.1 billion and $4.1 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at September 30, 2022 was 7.9 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Bank of America  78


Customer VIEsCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $999 million and $2.9 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEsThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $111 million and $235 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Investment VIEsThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $665 million and $1.0 billion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $7.9 billion and $7.1 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VIEsThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate   affordable   housing,   wind   and   solar   projects.  An

unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $26.5 billion and $25.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.The Corporation’s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $13.4 billion and $12.6 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $6.3 billion and $5.8 billion, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $409 million and $1.2 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $311 million and $938 million. For the same periods in 2021, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $350 million and $1.1 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $282 million and $837 million. These tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation’s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.

NOTE 8 Leases
The Corporation enters into both lessor and lessee arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 – Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on lease financing receivables, see Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Lessor Arrangements
The Corporation’s lessor arrangements primarily consist of operating, sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term.
The table below presents the net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

NOTE 9 Securities Financing Agreements, Collateral and Restricted Cash
The Corporation enters into securities financing agreements which include securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These financing agreements (also referred to as “matched-book transactions”) are to accommodate customers, obtain securities to cover short positions and finance inventory positions. The Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements under the fair value option. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.
Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements
The Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. For more information on the offsetting of derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives. For more information on the securities financing agreements and the offsetting of securities financing transactions, see Note 10 – Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Repurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned Transactions Accounted for as Secured BorrowingsThe following tables present securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned by remaining contractual term to maturity and class of collateral pledged. Included in “Other” are transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that  can  be  pledged  as collateral or sold. Certain agreements contain a right to substitute collateral and/or terminate the agreement prior to maturity at the option of the Corporation or the counterparty. Such agreements are included in the table below based on the remaining contractual term to maturity.

CollateralThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of this collateral was $774.4 billion and $854.8 billion, of which $712.4 billion and $782.7 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. For more information on collateral, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Restricted CashAt September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.6 billion and $5.9 billion, predominantly related to cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve requirements.NOTE 10 Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The carrying value of the Corporation’s credit extension commitments at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, were $1.5 billion, which predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $3.5 billion and $4.8 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $200 million and $97 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation’s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Bank of America  82

(2)  The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument were $26.4 billion and $10.1 billion at September 30, 2022, and $26.3 billion and $8.7 billion at December 31, 2021. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $534 million and $512 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.(3)     Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value guarantees.
(4)     Includes business card unused lines of credit. Other CommitmentsAt September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $655 million and $181 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $395 million and $518 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $253 million and $949 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation  had  commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $89.5 billion and $92.0 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $70.1 billion and $32.6 billion. These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months.At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $720 million and $395 million. Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $4.4 billion and $6.3 billion. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $650 million and $928 million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant ServicesThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was approximately $509 billion, is an estimate of the Corporation’s maximum potential exposure as of September 30, 2022. The Corporation’s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant. Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesFor more information on representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
83 Bank of America


Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo ProgramThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $38.6 billion and $42.0 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Other GuaranteesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Guarantees of Certain Long-term DebtThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosures supplement the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.  As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters below and the matters disclosed in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $507 million and $1.1 billion was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $66 million and $155 million for the same periods in  2021.For any matter disclosed in this Note and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation’s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.7 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of September 30, 2022. The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.Information is provided below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be material to the Corporation’s business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm.

Ambac Bond Insurance LitigationAmbac v. Countrywide IAmbac v. Countrywide II Ambac v. First FranklinOn October 6, 2022, the Corporation and certain wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with Ambac Assurance Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Ambac”) to resolve the above referenced matters. Under the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the Corporation’s payment of $1.84 billion, Ambac, among other things, caused these matters to be dismissed with prejudice, and released the Corporation and its subsidiaries from all outstanding claims related to Ambac’s issuance of bond insurance policies for certain of the Corporation’s and legacy entities’ securitized pools of residential mortgage loans. Prepaid Debit Card InvestigationsOn July 14, 2022, BANA agreed to settle two separate proceedings with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) related to BANA’s administration of prepaid debit cards to distribute unemployment benefits. The orders found that BANA’s fraud prevention measures and resolution of potentially unauthorized transactions improperly delayed or denied access by certain cardholders to account funds. Without admitting or denying the findings, BANA consented to orders requiring it to improve its processes, review accounts and compensate cardholders, and pay penalties of $125 million and $100 million to the OCC and CFPB, respectively. The Corporation continues to defend civil litigation, including putative class actions, concerning BANA’s administration of these prepaid debit card programs.Record-keeping InvestigationsCertain of the Corporation’s U.S. subsidiaries have been cooperating with investigations by the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding compliance by financial institutions with record-keeping obligations for broker-dealers, investment advisors, swap dealers and futures commission merchants pertaining to business-related electronic communications sent over unapproved electronic messaging channels. On September 27, 2022, these subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the SEC and CFTC to resolve their respective civil investigations. The SEC and CFTC found that BofA Securities, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith

Incorporated did not maintain copies of certain communications required to be maintained under their respective record-keeping rules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use. The CFTC resolution also includes BANA. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, a $125 million civil monetary penalty was paid to the SEC, and a $100 million civil monetary penalty was paid to the CFTC.

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact Bank of America  86


on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation measures fair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note  20  –  Fair   Value   Measurements   to   the   Consolidated Financial  Statements  of the Corporation’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The  Corporation  accounts  for  certain  financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Recurring Fair Value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, including financial instruments that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.

The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI. Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to decreased price observability, and transfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

Glossary
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Macro Products – Include currencies, interest rates and commodities products.Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.Bank of America  100

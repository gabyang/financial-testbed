Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its management may make certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.” Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation’s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under
Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and in any of the Corporation’s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation’s potential claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions; the possibility that the Corporation’s future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, regulatory, and representations and warranties exposures; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased servicing, fraud, indemnity, contribution or other claims from one or more counterparties, including trustees, purchasers of loans, underwriters, issuers, monolines, private-label and other investors, or other parties involved in securitizations; the Corporation’s ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims, including claims brought by investors or trustees seeking to avoid the statute of limitations for repurchase claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of the London InterBank Offered Rate and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs,

and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate environment on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties; the Corporation’s ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding net interest income, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards, including the new credit loss accounting standard; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of regulations, other guidance or additional information on the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards and derivatives regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach of the Corporation’s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks; the impact on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations from the planned exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government’s debt limit; and other matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary.



Bank of America    2Executive SummaryBusiness OverviewThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, “the Corporation” may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At September 30, 2019, the Corporation had $2.4 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 209,000 employees.As of September 30, 2019, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 90 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 66 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,300 retail financial centers, approximately 16,600 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with nearly 38 million active users, including approximately 29 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business owners. Our wealth management businesses, with client balances of $2.9 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.Recent DevelopmentsCapital ManagementDuring the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors’ (the Board) 2019 repurchase authorization of approximately $30.9 billion announced on June 27, 2019. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 20. On July 25, 2019, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on September 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of September 6, 2019. Additionally, on October 22, 2019, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on December 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of December 6, 2019. Merchant Services Joint VentureAs previously disclosed in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, a significant portion of our merchant processing activity is performed by a joint venture, formed in 2009, in which we own a 49 percent ownership  interest. The joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment. On July 29, 2019, we gave notice to the joint venture partner of the termination of the joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term, after which we expect to pursue our own merchant services strategy. In addition, the Corporation and the joint venture partner have an agreement to provide uninterrupted delivery of products and services to the joint venture merchants through at least June 2023. As a result of the above actions, we incurred a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $2.1 billion included in other general operating expense in the three months ended September 30, 2019. We anticipate accounting for the joint venture as an equity method investment until June 2020. For additional information, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.U.K. Exit from the EUOn October 28, 2019, the EU agreed to extend the deadline for the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU to January 31, 2020. The final outcome of negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms and conditions of the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU remains uncertain.  We conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France. For information on the changes we have implemented to enable us to continue to operate in the region, including establishing a bank and broker-dealer in the EU, see the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. While we have taken measures to minimize operational disruption and prepare for various potential outcomes of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, the preparedness of our counterparties and the relevant financial markets infrastructure remain outside our control. The global economic impact of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU remains uncertain and could result in regional and global financial market disruptions. In preparation for the withdrawal, we will continue to assess potential risks, including operational, regulatory and legal risks.LIBOR and Other Benchmark RatesAs previously disclosed, to facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative led by senior management to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), achieve operational readiness and engage impacted clients in connection with the transition to ARRs. Additionally, the Corporation continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A of the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 2019, and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other and Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 45. Net income was $5.8 billion and $20.4 billion, or $0.56 and $2.01 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $7.2 billion and $20.9 billion, or $0.66 and $1.91 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2018. The decrease in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in noninterest expense as a result of a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture at the conclusion of its current term. Also contributing to the decrease in net income were higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Total assets increased $71.8 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.4 trillion primarily driven by higher trading account assets in Global Markets due to increased client balances in Equities and increased levels of inventory in Fixed-Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) to facilitate expected client demand, higher loans and leases primarily due to continued residential mortgage and commercial loan growth, and increases in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell driven by short-term reinvestments of excess cash.Total liabilities increased $68.8 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.2 trillion driven by higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase primarily driven by funding needs in the FICC businesses within Global Markets, an increase in long-term debt due to valuation adjustments, higher deposits as a result of continued growth in our Consumer Banking and Global Banking businesses, higher trading account liabilities in FICC to facilitate expected client  demand, and an increase in other short-term borrowings as a result of higher Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Shareholders’ equity increased $3.1 billion from December 31, 2018 primarily due to net income, market value increases on debt securities and issuances of preferred stock, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, and the redemption of preferred stock.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased $126 million to $12.2 billion, and $1.1 billion to $36.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 4 basis points (bps) to 2.41 percent, and increased 2 bps to 2.45 percent for the same periods. The increase in net interest income for both periods was primarily driven by loan and deposit growth, and for the three-month period, partially offset by lower interest rates. The increase in the nine-month period was also due to higher short-end interest rates. Both long- and short-term interest rates have declined during 2019. We expect net interest income for 2019 to grow approximately one percent as compared to 2018. This reflects the expectation for another short-end rate cut in the fourth quarter of 2019, that long-end interest rates remain flat compared to September 30, 2019 and economic conditions remain stable. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 43.  Bank of America    4



Noninterest Income

Noninterest income decreased $43 million to $10.6 billion, and decreased $541 million to $32.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The following highlights the significant changes.●Service charges were relatively unchanged for the three-month period and decreased $119 million for the nine-month period primarily driven by lower treasury fees in Global Banking as well as lower fees due to policy changes and lower ATM volume in Consumer Banking. •Investment and brokerage services income was unchanged for the three-month period and decreased $292 million for the nine-month period. The decline was primarily due to lower transactional revenue and a decrease in assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the positive impact of AUM flows.●Investment banking fees increased $329 million for the three-month period due to increases in advisory and debt underwriting fees, and increased $189 million for the nine-month period due to increases in advisory and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by decreases in debt underwriting.

●Other income decreased $424 million and $272 million for the three- and nine-month periods primarily due to an equity investment gain in the prior-year period and lower gains on sales of debt securities. Also, the prior-year nine-month period included a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by a $572 million gain from the sale of certain non-core mortgage loans.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased $63 million to $779 million, and $272 million to $2.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases  were driven by commercial, primarily as a result of energy reserve releases in the prior-year periods, partially offset by a decrease in consumer, primarily driven by the impact of recoveries recorded in connection with sales of previously charged-off non-core consumer real estate loans. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 39.

Noninterest expense increased $2.2 billion to $15.2 billion and $1.6 billion to $41.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase in both periods was primarily due to the aforementioned impairment charge of $2.1 billion, increased costs associated with investment in the businesses, including brand-related marketing costs, and higher litigation expense, partially offset by efficiency savings, lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense and lower amortization of intangibles expense.

Income Tax Expense

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflect the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits and discrete tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax matters. The nine-month effective rate also included tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflect the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits. The nine-month effective rate also included tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be approximately 19 percent, absent unusual items.Supplemental Financial DataIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items

is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows:●Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 5.For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 45.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit,  market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 20. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 18 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank. For more information about GWIM, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Three-Month Comparison Net income for GWIM increased $84 million to $1.1 billion due to higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. The operating margin was 30 percent compared to 28 percent a year ago.Net interest income increased $78 million to $1.6 billion due to growth in deposits and loans.Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $9 million to $3.3 billion. The increase was driven by the impact of positive AUM flows and higher average market valuations compared to the same period in 2018, largely offset by lower AUM pricing and transactional revenue.Noninterest expense decreased $30 million to $3.4 billion, as investments for business growth were more than offset by lower amortization of intangibles and FDIC expense. The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, up from 28 percent, due to higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.MLGWM revenue of $4.1 billion increased three percent, reflecting higher net interest income and asset management fees.  Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $851 million decreased two percent primarily due to lower net interest income.Nine-Month Comparison Net income for GWIM increased $311 million to $3.2 billion due to higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. The operating margin was 29 percent compared to 27 percent a year ago.Net interest income increased $264 million to $4.9 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $54 million to $9.7 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in AUM pricing and transactional revenue, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows. Noninterest expense decreased $151 million to $10.3 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month section.The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, up from 27 percent, due to higher net income. MLGWM revenue of $12.1 billion increased two percent primarily driven by higher net interest income and the impact of higher AUM flows, partially offset by lower transactional volumes and AUM pricing. Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $2.6 billion decreased one percent due to the same factor as described in the three-month section.

For more information about Global Banking, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Three-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Banking increased $60 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by higher revenue partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.Revenue increased $389 million to $5.2 billion driven by higher noninterest income offset in part by a modest decline in net interest income. Net interest income decreased $109 million to $2.6 billion as the impact of deposit and loan growth was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activities and loan spread compression. Noninterest income increased $498 million to $2.6 billion driven by growth in investment banking fees and leasing-related revenues. The provision for credit losses increased $190 million to $120 million due to reserve releases in the prior-year period, primarily from energy exposures. Noninterest expense increased $78 million to $2.2 billion primarily due to continued investment in the business.The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent for both periods. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Banking decreased $86 million to $6.1 billion primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense partially offset by higher revenue. Revenue increased $510 million to $15.3 billion driven by higher noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $28 million to $8.1 billion primarily due to the allocation of ALM activities and loan spread compression more than offsetting the benefit from higher loan and deposit balances.Noninterest income increased $538 million to $7.2 billion primarily due to higher leasing-related revenue and investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses increased $433 million to $356 million primarily driven by energy reserve releases in the prior-year period. Noninterest expense increased $79 million  primarily due to continued investment in the business partially offset by lower FDIC expense.The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent for both periods.

Business Lending revenue increased $24 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 driven by higher leasing-related revenue partly offset by lower ALM results.  For the nine-month period, revenue decreased $85 million as lower ALM results were partly offset by higher leasing-related revenue. Global Transaction Services revenue increased $65 million and $398 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by higher deposit balances and rates.Average loans and leases increased seven percent and six percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Average deposits increased seven percent and nine percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 due to growth in domestic and international interest-bearing balances. Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions.

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in  both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Three-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Markets decreased $72 million to $847 million. Net DVA losses were $15 million compared to losses of $99 million, and excluding net DVA, net income decreased $136 million to $858 million. These decreases were primarily driven by a decline in revenue and an increase in noninterest expense.Revenue declined $9 million to $3.9 billion as higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees were more than offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment in the prior-year quarter. Sales and trading revenue increased $217 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $133 million primarily driven by an increase in Equities revenue.Noninterest expense increased $46 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses and continued investment in technology.Average total assets increased $34.9 billion to $687.4 billion driven by increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand and higher client balances in Equities.The return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 10 percent. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.Nine-Month Comparison Net income for Global Markets decreased $517 million to $2.9 billion. Net DVA losses were $136 million compared to losses of $214 million. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $577 million to $3.0 billion, primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue declined $746 million to $12.2 billion as sales and trading revenue decreased $677 million, and excluding net DVA, decreased $755 million due to declines in both FICC and Equities revenue.Noninterest expense decreased $174 million to $8.1 billion primarily driven by lower revenue-related expenses. Average total assets increased $9.4 billion to $679.0 billion primarily due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. Period-end total assets increased $47.1 billion from December 31, 2018 to $689.0 billion due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand and higher client balances in Equities.The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent, down from 13 percent, reflecting lower net income.Sales and Trading RevenueFor a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

FICC net DVA losses were $18 million and $127 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to losses of $80 million and $187 million for the same periods in 2018. Equities net DVA gains were $3 million and losses of $9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to losses of $19 million and $27 million for the same periods in 2018.The following explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue exclude net DVA, but would be the same if net DVA was included.Three-Month ComparisonFICC revenue increased $5 million primarily driven by an improvement in mortgage and municipal products, largely offset by weaker trading performance in foreign exchange and credit  products. Equities revenue increased $128 million driven by growth in client financing activities.Nine-Month ComparisonFICC revenue decreased $381 million due to a generally weaker trading environment. Equities revenue decreased $374 million driven by under performance in derivatives compared to a strong prior-year period which benefited from higher client activity and elevated market volatility.  Bank of America    18

(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders’ equity. Average allocated assets were $536.8 billion and $540.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $516.3 billion and $516.8 billion for the same periods in 2018, and period-end allocated assets were $546.5 billion and $540.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $2.4 billion to $22.5 billion primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, total non-core loans decreased $6.5 billion to $17.0 billion due primarily to sales, payoffs and paydowns as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances, offset by repurchases. For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 26.Three-Month ComparisonThe net loss for All Other was $1.6 billion compared to net income of $32 million for the prior-year period. The current-year period included a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture at the conclusion of its current term.Revenue decreased $669 million due to lower net interest income and an increase in the loss in noninterest income. Net  interest income decreased $116 million driven by lower loan balances due to non-core consumer real estate loan sales and portfolio run-off. The loss in noninterest income increased $553 million driven by the results of certain ALM and other treasury activities, an increase in the reserve for payment protection insurance and lower gains on sales of debt securities.The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $200 million to $295 million primarily due to recoveries from sales of previously charged-off non-core consumer real estate loans. Noninterest expense increased $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion due to the $2.1 billion impairment charge and higher legacy mortgage-related litigation expense.The income tax benefit was $1.3 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $488 million in the same period in 2018. The increase in the tax benefit was primarily related to the tax impact of the impairment charge and discrete tax benefits from the resolution of various tax matters. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Nine-Month ComparisonThe net loss for All Other increased $1.3 billion to a loss of $1.6 billion due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion.Revenue decreased $844 million due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $238 million to $590 million primarily driven by the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense increased $1.9 billion to $3.4 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.The income tax benefit was $3.1 billion compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion in the same period in 2018 driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 11 – Long-term Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and Warranties ObligationsFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our reserve for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates – Representations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Managing RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation’s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information  on capital management, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan.On June 27, 2019, following the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to our 2019 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $30.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, which includes approximately $900 million to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board's 2019 repurchase authorization.Our stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve’s non-objection.Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2019, the Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio.Minimum Capital RequirementsMinimum capital requirements and related buffers were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital.The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.   Bank of America    20

(1) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were both 2.5 percent at September 30, 2019 and 1.875 percent at December 31, 2018. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.(2) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(3) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.CET1 capital was $169.2 billion at September 30, 2019, an increase of $1.9 billion from December 31, 2018, driven by earnings and net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $4.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital and a net increase in  preferred stock. Risk-weighted assets under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2019, increased $46.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1,484 billion primarily due to increased client activity in Global Markets and Global Banking and an increase in other assets.Table 9 shows the capital composition at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

TLAC consists of the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements  as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of September 30, 2019.  Bank of America    22

The countercyclical buffer is zero for this period. The TLAC SLR leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC risk-weighted assets and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.(2) The long-term debt risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation’s method 2 G-SIB surcharge.(3) The approach that yields the higher risk-weighted assets is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2019.Regulatory DevelopmentsThe following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management – Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). As previously disclosed in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, BofAS was formed as a result of the reorganization of MLPF&S which was completed in May 2019. The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17.BofAS provides institutional services and is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2019, BofAS had tentative net capital of $13.3 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $11.1 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.3 billion by $8.8 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services. At September 30, 2019, MLPCC’s regulatory net capital of $4.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.2 billion by $3.7 billion.MLPF&S provides retail services. At September 30, 2019, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $3.3 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $104 million by $3.2 billionOur European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2019, MLI’s capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.8 billion by $20.2 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2019, BofASE's  capital resources were $5.0 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $1.3 billion by $3.7 billion.Liquidity RiskFunding and Liquidity Risk ManagementOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as our liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.NB Holdings CorporationWe have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered AssetsTable 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.Our bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $356 billion and $344 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $454 billion and $446 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 116 percent and 118 percent. Our LCR will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity.Liquidity Stress AnalysisWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.39 trillion and $1.38 trillion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions.Long-term DebtDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we issued $45.2 billion of long-term debt consisting of $24.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC eligible, $10.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $10.0 billion of other debt. Substantially all of the long-term, TLAC-eligible senior notes issued by Bank of America Corporation since late 2016 are callable, at our option, at least one year before each stated maturity date. The call features give us the flexibility to retire long-term notes before their final year outstanding, when they are no longer eligible to count toward TLAC requirements, and replace them with new TLAC-eligible debt, should we choose to do so.During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $42.8 billion consisting of $16.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $19.8 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.4 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2019.

Total long-term debt increased $14.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s  2018  Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 43.We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we issued $7.4 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/

or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.
Credit Ratings
Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 17 presents the Corporation’s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.The ratings from  Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.The ratings from Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (S&P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed  in  the  Corporation’s  2018  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.The long-term and short-term debt ratings of BofAS and BofASE, which were initially rated by S&P and Fitch during the first quarter of 2019, also remained unchanged for the third quarter of 2019.

For information on the new accounting standard on credit losses that is effective on January 1, 2020 and the potential impact on our allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit PortfolioImprovement in home prices continued during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 resulting in improved credit quality compared to the same period in 2018. Additionally, lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio due primarily to non-core loan sales were partially offset by seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio compared to the same period in 2018. Improved credit quality and continued loan balance runoff primarily in the non-core consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning within the U.S. credit card portfolio, drove a $226 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $4.6 billion. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 39.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2018  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.Table 18 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.

(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, residential mortgage includes $858 million and $1.4 billion of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $345 million and $498 million of loans on which interest was still accruing.(2) Outstandings include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $50.3 billion and $50.1 billion, unsecured consumer lending loans of $328 million and $383 million, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $36.5 billion and $37.0 billion, non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion and other consumer loans of $694 million and $746 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.(3) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $275 million and $336 million and home equity loans of $365 million and $346 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 16 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $7 million and $12 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.Table 19 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

(1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All  other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 20 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other. As shown in Table 20, outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $18.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 driven by an increase of $22.5 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $3.9 billion decrease in home equity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we sold $2.3 billion and $4.2 billion of consumer real estate loans,  primarily non-core.

(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $275 million and $336 million and home equity loans of $365 million and $346 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Note 16 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2019. Approximately 49 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 36 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in  our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $18.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $2.3 billion and runoff. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the residential mortgage portfolio included $18.7 billion and $20.1 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $11.7 billion and $14.0 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. Table 21 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.  Bank of America    28

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans accounted for $396 million, or 26 percent, and $536 million, or 28 percent, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $342 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by sales. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2019, $586 million, or 38 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $85 million due to continued improvement in credit quality as well as loan sales in the non-core portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased $50 million to a net recovery of $38 million and $64 million to a net recovery of $51 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality and recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off loans. Of the $208.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2019, as shown in Table 21, 27 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $7.9 billion, or 14 percent, at September 30, 2019. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2019, $156 million, or two percent, of outstanding  interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.1 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2019, $301 million, or four percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $97 million were contractually current, compared to $1.6 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 93 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later.Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states).(3) Amounts exclude the fully-insured loan portfolio.Home Equity At September 30, 2019, the home equity portfolio made up nine percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages.At September 30, 2019, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $38.7 billion, or 93 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $44.3 billion, or 92 percent, at December 31, 2018. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans.At September 30, 2019, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.3 billion, or three percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.8 billion, or four percent, at December 31, 2018. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years, and of the $1.3 billion at September 30, 2019, 71 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At September 30, 2019, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.6 billion, or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $2.2 billion, also four percent, at December 31, 2018. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. At September 30, 2019, 79 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 13 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $6.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to paydowns and loan sales of $1.9 billion outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $15.3 billion, or 37 percent, and $17.3 billion, or 36 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2019, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $7.1 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $43.3 billion at September 30, 2019 compared to $43.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of lower utilization of open lines and new production partially offset by customers choosing to close accounts. The HELOC utilization rate was 47 percent and 51 percent at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Table 23 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics.

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $32 million and $48 million and nonperforming loans include $61 million and $218 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.(3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios and accounted for 35 percent and 49 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as outflows, primarily sales, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2019, $266 million, or 45 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. We estimate that approximately $67 million of junior-lien loans had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. In addition, $172 million, or 29 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $139 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.Net charge-offs decreased $182 million to a net recovery of $202 million, and $359 million to a net recovery of $346 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily driven by recoveries from the sales of previously charged off non-core home equity loans. Of the $41.6 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2019, as shown in Table 23, 17 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $12.3 billion at September 30, 2019. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2019, $162 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2019, $518 million, or four percent, were nonperforming. For more information on HELOC amortization, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, 26 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.  Bank of America    30Table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home  equity portfolio at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

U.S. Credit CardAt September 30, 2019, 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM. Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $3.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $94.9 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes. Net charge-offs increased $19 million to $717 million and $86 million to $2.2 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to portfolio seasoning. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $52 million during the nine  months ended September 30, 2019 and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $34 million, driven by seasonal declines.Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $339.7 billion and $334.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The increase in unused lines was driven by seasonally lower purchase volumes, as well as account growth and lines of credit increases.Table 25 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Direct/Indirect ConsumerAt September 30, 2019, 56 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending – automotive, recreational vehicle, marine, aircraft and consumer personal loans) and 44 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $330 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to  $90.8 billion primarily due to declines in securities-based lending driven by repayments and lower draws. Net charge-offs increased $34 million to $76 million, and $28 million to $170 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018.Table 26 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 27 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $1.4 billion.At September 30, 2019, $678 million, or 31 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2019, $902 million, or 41  percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties decreased $56 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $188 million as liquidations outpaced additions. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 27.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer’s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio).Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 27 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $657 million and $566 million, of which $558 million and $481 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing runoff of existing portfolios.Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry  concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 36 and Table 36.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Commercial Credit PortfolioDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2019, credit quality among large corporate and middle-market borrowers in our commercial and industrial portfolio remained strong. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable with conservative LTV ratios. However, some of the real estate markets experienced slowing tenant demand and decelerating rental income.Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $16.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $637.2 billion driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 58 percent at September 30, 2019 and 59 percent at December 31, 2018.Table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $35.1 billion and $33.0 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, which consists primarily of other marketable securities.Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $17.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily in the commercial and industrial portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $58 million to $4.9 billion at September 30, 2019. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 39.

Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $774 million, or seven percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 driven by a small number of client downgrades across various industries and was not indicative of broader issues in the portfolio. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, 90 percent and 91 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

U.S. commercial loans increased $11.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, across lines of business.  Nonperforming U.S. commercial loans increased $172 million and reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $803 million, or 10 percent, driven by a small number of client downgrades across various industries.Non-U.S. CommercialAt September 30, 2019, 84 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 16 percent in Global Markets. Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $2.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily in Global Banking. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 38. Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans  secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $2.0 billion, or three percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $62.8 billion due to new originations slightly outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 24 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Table 33 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

Credit card-related products were 53 percent and 51 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 92 percent and 95 percent were credit card-related products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 95 percent and 94 percent for same periods in 2018. Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 34 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $185 million to $1.3 billion. At September 30, 2019, 93 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 56 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 90 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan  and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance.(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 35 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry Concentrations Table 36 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $38.1 billion, or four percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.0 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Real estate, Financial markets infrastructure, and Capital goods industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Global commercial banks, Insurance, and Commercial services and supplies industry sectors.For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $109.8 billion, increased $2.0 billion,  or two percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $93.6 billion, increased $7.1 billion, or eight percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This growth occurred primarily in the category of property developers and owners, partially offset by declines in REITs and multiple-use and all other property types.Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $79.3 billion, increased $4.2 billion, or six percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 with the growth largely occurring in the machinery and trading companies and distributors industry categories, partially offset by a decrease in large conglomerates.

Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which  we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion. We recorded net losses on these positions of $15 million and $93 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to net losses of $33 million and $43 million for the same periods in 2018 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results  for  these  exposures

are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 42. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 41.Tables 37 and 38 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.Table 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2019. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $10.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by increased sovereign and corporate exposure across multiple countries. For more information on the top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A number of economic conditions and geopolitical events have given rise to risk aversion in certain emerging markets. Additionally, in light of ongoing trade tensions, we continue to closely monitor our exposures to tariff-sensitive regions and industries, particularly to countries that account for a large percentage of U.S. trade, such as China.Our largest emerging market country exposure at September 30, 2019 was China, with net exposure of $14.5 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of  reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the U.K.’s ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the EU will further weigh on economic performance. For additional information, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – U.K. Exit from the EU on page 3. Our largest EU country exposure at September 30, 2019 was the U.K. with net exposure of $55.6 billion, which represents a $696 million increase from December 31, 2018. Our second largest EU exposure was Germany with net exposure of $26.1 billion, which represents a $2.6 billion decrease from December 31, 2018. The decrease in Germany was primarily driven by a reduction in  sovereign exposure.  Bank of America    38Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses increased $63 million to $779 million, and $272 million to $2.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The provision for credit losses was $32 million and $40 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, resulting in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a decrease of $216 million and $462 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $811 million and $2.7 billion compared to $932 million and $2.8 billion for the same periods in 2018. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $146 million to $564 million and $181 million to $2.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by consumer real estate loan sales.The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $209 million to $215 million and $453 million to $615 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase was due in part to energy releases in the prior-year periods. Allowance for Credit LossesAllowance for Loan and Lease LossesDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $1.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as loan sales, returns to performing status and paydowns continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 41, was $4.6 billion at September 30, 2019, a decrease of $226 million from December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven primarily by continued portfolio seasoning. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 41, was $4.9 billion at September 30, 2019, an increase of $58 million from December 31, 2018.  Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2019 from $11.1 billion (to 2.17 percent from 2.08 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2018, and nonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2019 from $1.1 billion (to 0.25 percent from 0.22 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2018 with the increases spread across multiple industries. See Tables 30, 31 and 32 for more details on key commercial credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 0.98 percent at September 30, 2019 compared to 1.02 percent at December 31, 2018. For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard regarding the measurement of the allowance for credit losses that will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020, we expect that, based on current expectations of future economic conditions, our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases may increase up to approximately 30 percent from our allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2019, as disclosed herein, with a large portion of that increase driven by the U.S. credit card portfolio. The increase from the previously disclosed expectation of up to 20 percent was driven by refinements to certain models and methodologies along with the third-quarter 2019 loan sales, which reduced the expected recoveries on previously charged-off loans as the recoveries were realized upon sale. The ultimate impact upon adoption will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation’s portfolios, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts, and the finalized validation of models and methodologies, as well as other management judgments. For additional information regarding this new accounting standard, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers’ acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $809 million at September 30, 2019 compared to $797 million at December 31, 2018.

VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Table 42 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on our trading risk management process and on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 42 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.Table 42 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 42 and Table 43 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.The average total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to an increase in equity risk, partially offset by a decrease in interest rate risk.

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 43 at the same level of detail as in Table 42. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 43 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.

Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management – Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of  financial instruments and markets. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management – Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 92 percent of the trading days, of which 70 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $35 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2019 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 91 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  Bank of America    42




Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management – Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book
The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 44 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Table 45 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment.In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 20.

Table 45Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes           Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps)       September 30 2019 December 31 2018(Dollars in millions)   Parallel Shifts       +100 bps instantaneous shift+100 +100 $4,576 $2,833-100 bps instantaneous shift-100 -100 (6,479) (4,280)Flatteners       Short-end instantaneous change+100 — 2,696 2,158Long-end instantaneous change— -100 (3,050) (1,618)Steepeners       Short-end instantaneous change-100 — (3,343) (2,648)Long-end instantaneous change— +100 1,917 675
The sensitivity analysis in Table 45 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 45 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.
Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts
Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $452 million and $1.3 billion, on a pretax basis, at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at September 30, 2019, the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: 21 percent within the next year, 33 percent in years two through five and 26 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 20 percent

thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at September 30, 2019. Table 46 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest rates swaps decreased, driven by lower swap rates.

Foreign exchange contracts of $(8.4) billion at December 31, 2018 were comprised of $25.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(32.7) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(1.8) billion in foreign currency-denominated interest rate swaps and $814 million in foreign currency futures contracts.(6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position.  Bank of America    44Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential mortgage loans held for sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded gains of $78 million and $217 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains  and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $61 million and $190 million for the same periods in 2018. For more information on MSRs, see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Bank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2018  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.The nature of the Corporation’s business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results, have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet AdoptedAccounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit LossesThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. This standard replaces the existing measurement of the allowance for credit losses that is based on management’s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the Corporation’s lending activities with management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation’s relevant financial assets. The lifetime expected credit losses will be determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the portfolios and is required to be  determined net of expected recoveries on loans that were previously charged off. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. While the standard changes the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, it does not change the Corporation’s credit risk of its lending portfolios or the ultimate losses in those portfolios.Significant progress has been made in the implementation efforts, which include model development and validation, data acquisition for model estimation and new disclosures, and the establishment of formal policies supporting all aspects of the standard. The Corporation is running parallel processes encompassing the functionality of the models, internal controls over the estimation process and all other governance activities as well as continuing to review and refine its models and methodologies.Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation expects that, based on current expectations of future economic conditions, its allowance for credit losses on loans and leases may increase up to approximately 30 percent from its allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2019, as disclosed herein, with a large portion of that increase driven by the U.S. credit card portfolio. The increase from the previously disclosed expectation of up to 20 percent was driven by refinements to certain models and methodologies along with the third-quarter 2019 loan sales, which reduced the expected recoveries on previously charged-off loans as the recoveries were realized upon sale. The ultimate impact upon adoption will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation’s portfolios, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts, and the finalized validation of models and methodologies, as well as other management judgments.New Accounting StandardsLease AccountingOn January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standards that require lessees to recognize operating leases on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based on the value of the discounted future lease payments. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements are required prospectively and are included in Note 9 – Leases. The Corporation elected to retain prior determinations of whether an existing contract contains a lease and how the lease should be classified. The Corporation elected to recognize leases existing on January 1, 2019 through a cumulative-effect adjustment which increased retained earnings by $165 million, with no adjustment to prior periods presented. Upon adoption, the Corporation also recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $9.7 billion. Adoption of the standards did not have a significant effect on the Corporation’s regulatory capital measures.Lease Accounting PrinciplesLessor ArrangementsThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis. Leases generally do not contain non-lease components.


Bank of America    50Lessee ArrangementsSubstantially all of the Corporation’s lessee arrangements are operating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are  recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives.NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest IncomeThe table below presents the Corporation’s net interest income and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

Offsetting of DerivativesThe Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. For additional information, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable,  on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 10 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash.

Financial instruments collateral includes securities collateral received or pledged and cash securities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.
Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through DerivativesThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation had transferred $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion.ALM and Risk Management DerivativesThe Corporation’s asset and liability management (ALM) and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate  risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. For additional information, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).   Bank of America    54

Cash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe following table summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Of the $365 million after-tax net loss ($479 million pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at September 30, 2019, $78 million after-tax ($103 million pretax) is expected to be reclassified into earnings  in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 3 years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 16 years.

Other Risk Management Derivatives
Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging various assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on these derivatives are recognized in other income. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense recorded on the hedged item.

The net gains on IRLCs, which are not included in the table but are considered derivative instruments, were $20 million and $56 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $8 million and $36 million for the same periods in 2018.
(2) Primarily related to hedges of debt securities carried at fair value and hedges of foreign currency-denominated debt.
Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The difference between total trading account income in the following table and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets.

Credit DerivativesThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how  risk is managed for these instruments. For more information on credit derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are summarized in the following table.  Bank of America    56

The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.

Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralA majority of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $91.0 billion and $81.6 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $73.6 billion and $56.5 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. For more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.At September 30, 2019, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $2.0 billion, including $1.0 billion for Bank of America, National Association.Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.The following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at September 30, 2019 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.

Annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value (LTV), creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 12.5 percent for prime, 11.5 percent for Alt-A and 20.2 percent for subprime at September 30, 2019. Default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates  by collateral type were 8.8 percent for prime, 11.3 percent for Alt-A and 15.4 percent for subprime at September 30, 2019.

The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the Corporation’s underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $7.0 billion and $6.1 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Corporation sold $2.3 billion and $4.2 billion of consumer real  estate compared to $3.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the same periods in 2018. Nonperforming Loans and LeasesThe Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loans have not been otherwise modified. The Corporation continues to have a lien on the underlying collateral. At September 30, 2019, nonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms were $112 million of which $56 million were current on their contractual payments, while $46 million were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current nonperforming loans, 61 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy over 12 months ago, and 50 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago.

The table below presents the Corporation’s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For more information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Residential mortgage loans in the core and non-core portfolios accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, residential mortgage includes $858 million and $1.4 billion of loans on which interest has been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and therefore are no longer accruing interest, although principal is still insured, and $345 million and $498 million of loans on which interest is still accruing.

Credit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments and their related credit quality indicators, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation’s Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Refreshed FICO score and other internal credit metrics are applicable only to the U.S. small business commercial portfolio.
(3) Other internal credit metrics may include delinquency status, application scores, geography or other factors. At both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, 99 percent of the balances where internal credit metrics are used were current or less than 30 days past due.Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt RestructuringsA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. For additional information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Consumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the definition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower. For more information on impaired consumer real estate loans, see Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2018  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.  Consumer real estate loans of $671 million that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at September 30, 2019, of which $112 million were classified as nonperforming and $290 million were loans fully insured by the FHA. For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $188 million and $244 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at September 30, 2019 was $1.7 billion. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Corporation reclassified $128 million and $427 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The following table provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and the average carrying value and interest  income recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 for impaired loans in the Corporation’s Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment. Certain impaired consumer real estate loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.

The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer’s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs).  Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. The following table provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and the average carrying value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 for TDRs within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment.

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired credit card and other consumer loans. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 14 percent of new U.S. credit card TDRs and 16 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Commercial LoansImpaired commercial loans include nonperforming loans and leases and TDRs (both performing and nonperforming). For more information on impaired commercial loans, see Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2018  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were $425 million and $297 million. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was not significant at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.The table below provides information on impaired loans in the Commercial loan portfolio segment including the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and the average carrying value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Certain impaired commercial loans do not have a related allowance because the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.  Bank of America    68

The tables in this Note present the assets, liabilities and maximum loss exposure of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. For more information on the Corporation’s use of VIEs and related maximum loss exposure, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 7 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2018  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 – Securities or Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases. The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or the year ended December 31, 2018 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $1.0 billion and $218 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties. Except as described in Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties.The following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the GSEs or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the normal course of business and primarily receives RMBS in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are sold shortly after receipt. (2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $19 million and $38 million, net of hedges, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $15 million and $60 million for the same periods in 2018, are not included in the table above.
(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans.

(1) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For additional information, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies.(2) At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $10.5 billion and $11.0 billion of seller’s interest.(3) At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, all other assets in the consolidated credit card trust included certain short-term investments and unbilled accrued interest and fees.(4) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
(5) Total assets of VIEs includes loans the Corporation transferred with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loan.
Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller’s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts.During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, there were $1.3 billion and $4.0 billion of new senior debt securities issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust.At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.4 billion and $7.7 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. There were $202 million and $650 million of these subordinate securities issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $5.2 billion and $13.7 billion of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $7.7 billion and $21.3 billion for the same periods in 2018. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in trading account income prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $750 million and $3.5 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $1.5 billion and $3.7 billion for the same periods in 2018. Substantially all of the other securities received as resecuritization proceeds were classified as trading securities and were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $3.4 billion and $2.1 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at September 30, 2019 was 10.8 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

Customer VIEsCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEsThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $275 million and $421 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Investment VIEsThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $105 million and $270 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $34.5 billion and $37.7 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $7.0 billion and $7.2 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2019  and December 31, 2018. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VIEsThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $17.2 billion and $17.0 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.The Corporation’s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $9.1 billion and $8.9 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $3.9 billion and $3.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. The Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $276 million and $847 million and reported pretax losses in other income of $250 million and $732 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the same periods in 2018, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $265 million and $750 million and pretax losses in other income of $215 million and $640 million. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation’s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year’s expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from 25 percent. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.  Bank of America    74

NOTE 9 Leases
The Corporation enters into both lessor and lessee arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and on lease financing receivables, see Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases.
Lessor Arrangements
The Corporation’s lessor arrangements primarily consist of operating, sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term.At September 30, 2019, the total net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases was $22.0 billion, comprised of $19.5 billion in lease receivables and $2.5 billion in unguaranteed residuals. In certain cases, the Corporation obtains third-party residual value insurance to reduce its residual asset risk. The carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $5.7 billion.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, total lease income was $425 million and $1.3 billion, consisting of $198 million and $601 million from sales-type and direct financing leases and $227 million and $663 million from operating leases.
Lessee Arrangements
The Corporation’s lessee arrangements predominantly consist of operating leases for premises and equipment; the Corporation’s financing leases are not significant. Right-of-use assets were $9.8 billion and lease liabilities were $10.1 billion at September 30, 2019. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the present value of future minimum lease payments was four percent.

Lease terms may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features. Generally, these options do not impact the lease term because the Corporation is not reasonably certain that it will exercise the options. The weighted-average lease term was 8.2 years at September 30, 2019.
The table below provides the components of lease cost and supplemental information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Restricted CashAt September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $20.4 billion and $22.6 billion, predominantly related to cash held on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and non-U.S. central banks to meet reserve requirements and cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations.NOTE 11 Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Credit Extension CommitmentsThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts  distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.9 billion and $10.7 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. At September 30, 2019, the carrying value of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $826 million, including deferred revenue of $17 million and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $809 million. At December 31, 2018, the comparable amounts were $813 million, $16 million and $797 million, respectively. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s ability to pay. The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of $4.8 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes cumulative net fair value of $116 million and $169 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation’s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 16 – Fair Value Option.

(1)  At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $5.3 billion and $4.3 billion of these loan commitments are held in the form of a security. (2)  The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument were $26.6 billion and $8.3 billion at September 30, 2019, and $28.3 billion and $7.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $406 million and $372 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.(3)  At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, included are letters of credit of $1.1 billion and $422 million related to certain liquidity commitments of VIEs. For additional information, see Note 7 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities.
(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.
Other CommitmentsAt September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $135 million and $329 million, which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $464 million and $463 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $976 million and $1.3 billion, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $119.7 billion and $59.7 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $64.4 billion and $21.2 billion. These commitments expire primarily within the next 15 months.At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2022 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $7.2 billion and $9.8 billion. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039.  Merchant ServicesIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. If a merchant processor fails to meet its obligation regarding disputed transactions, then the Corporation could be held liable.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the sponsored entities processed $229.4 billion and $670.6 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $6 million and $17 million. For the same periods in 2018, the sponsored entities processed $220.0 billion and $646.9 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $6 million and $23 million. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled $375.7 billion and $348.1 billion. However, the Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure and does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees.A significant portion of the Corporation's merchant processing activity is performed by a joint venture, formed in 2009, in which the Corporation holds a 49 percent ownership interest. The carrying value of the Corporation’s investment was $652 million and $2.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and reported in All Other. On July 29, 2019, the Corporation gave notice to the joint venture partner of the termination of the joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term in June 2020. As a result, the Corporation incurred a non-cash, pretax impairment charge in the three months ended September 30, 2019 of $2.1 billion, included in other general operating expense.Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesFor more information on representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, and the related reserve and estimated range of possible loss, see Note 12 – Commitments and   Bank of America    78Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate of probable incurred losses. It is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation’s combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.Other GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately $8.1 billion and $5.9 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees. For more information on maximum potential future payments under VIE-related liquidity commitments, see Note 7 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Corporation recognized a loss of $135 million in other income under its indemnity obligation in connection with the sale of its non-U.S. consumer credit card business (payment protection insurance). For additional information, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Guarantees of Certain Long-term DebtThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosure supplements the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, the timing of the ultimate resolution of these  matters, or any eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $352 million and $539 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $90 million and $292 million for the same periods in 2018.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, for which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. With respect to such matters, in cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those disclosed matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, as well as for representations and warranties exposures, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for these exposures is $0 to $1.8 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below, or in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure regarding the nature of the litigation contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation’s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.Investigations of Precious Metals TradingIn connection with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) and U.S. Department of Justice's (DoJ) investigations of precious metals market trading practices, on June 25, 2019, Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. (MLCI), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, entered into a civil settlement with the CFTC and a non-prosecution agreement with the DoJ. Those resolutions resulted in settlement payments totaling $36.5 million and require MLCI and the Corporation to undertake certain remedial measures and other obligations.

For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, 62 million average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L preferred stock were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the “if-converted” method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, average options to purchase two million and five million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For both the three and nine months ended September  30, 2018, average warrants to purchase 122 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. These warrants expired on October 29, 2018. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, average warrants to purchase 135 million and 139 million shares of common stock were included in the diluted EPS calculation under the treasury stock method. Substantially all of these warrants were exercised on or before their expiration date of January 16, 2019.  Bank of America    80

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards and conducts a review of its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the  nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation measures fair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For additional information, see Note 16 – Fair Value Option.

(5) Total recurring Level 3 assets were 0.51 percent of total consolidated assets, and total recurring Level 3 liabilities were 0.25 percent of total consolidated liabilities.The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI. Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to  decreased price observability, and transfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

(1) For loans and securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets, the weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair value of the instruments. (2) The categories are aggregated based upon product type which differs from financial statement classification. The following is a reconciliation to the line items in the table on page 83: Trading account assets – Corporate securities, trading loans and other of $1.6 billion, Trading account assets – Non-U.S. sovereign debt of $465 million, Trading account assets – Mortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS of $1.6 billion, AFS debt securities of $606 million, Other debt securities carried at fair value - Non-agency residential of $172 million, Other assets, including MSRs, of 2.9 billion, Loans and leases of $338 million and LHFS of $542 million.(3) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes.(4) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation, Black-Scholes and other methods that model the joint dynamics of interest, inflation and foreign exchange rates.(5) The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest, prepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions.CPR = Constant Prepayment RateCDR = Constant Default RateMMBtu = Million British thermal unitsIR = Interest RateFX = Foreign Exchange

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable Inputs
For information on the types of instruments, valuation approaches and the impact of changes in unobservable inputs used in Level 3 measurements, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Nonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and  2018. In the tables below, other assets includes the measurement of the Corporation's merchant services equity method investment on which the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies.

Glossary
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.  Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Net Interest Yield – Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Operating Margin – Income before income taxes divided by total revenue, net of interest expense.Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.  Bank of America    94

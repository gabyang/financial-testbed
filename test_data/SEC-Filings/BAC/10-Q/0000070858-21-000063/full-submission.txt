Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its management may make certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.” Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation’s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation’s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation’s potential judgments, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, including as a result of our participation in and execution of government programs related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; the possibility that the Corporation's future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, and regulatory and government actions; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties involved in mortgage securitizations; the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs, and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate environment on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties; the Corporation’s concentration of credit risk; the Corporation's ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding revenue, net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of changes in or interpretations of income tax laws and regulations;  the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and any similar or related rules and regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach of the Corporation’s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or campaigns; the impact on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; the impact of climate change; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government’s debt limit or changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy; the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, including the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and/or global financial market conditions and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects; the impact of natural disasters, extreme weather events, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary.
Bank of America  2Executive SummaryBusiness OverviewThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, “the Corporation,” “we,” “us” and “our” may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our various bank and nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation had $3.0 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 212,000 employees.As of March 31, 2021, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in the U.S., and we serve approximately 66 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,300 retail financial centers, approximately 17,000 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 40 million active users, including approximately 31 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business households. Our GWIM businesses, with client balances of $3.5 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.Recent DevelopmentsCapital ManagementOn March 19, 2021, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC, and together with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, the U.S. banking regulators) announced that the temporary change to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for BHCs and depository institutions issued in 2020 would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation’s lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation’s SLR was 7.0 percent. Excluding the temporary relief, the SLR would have been approximately 6.1 percent, which is 1.1 percent, or $35 billion, in excess of the 5.0 percent required by the Federal Reserve.Due to uncertainty resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic), the Federal Reserve required large banks to suspend share repurchase programs during the second half of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit common stock dividends to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that beginning in the first quarter of 2021, large banks would be permitted to pay common stock dividends at existing rates and to repurchase shares in an amount that, when combined with dividends paid, did not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. Pursuant to the authorization of the Board of Directors (the Board), during the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the period. This authorization equaled the maximum amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the period.On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases currently in place will end for most banks after June 30, 2021, following the completion of 2021 supervisory stress tests. Banks, including the Corporation, with capital levels above those required by the stress tests will no longer be subject to the additional restrictions as of July 1, 2021, and will be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve’s stress capital buffer (SCB) framework. On April 15, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time. The Board also authorized repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. For the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation’s repurchase plans will be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s guidance that common stock repurchases and common stock dividends, when combined, should be limited to the average of the last four quarters’ net income. Following the expiration of the Federal Reserve's restrictions, the Corporation expects to return additional capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends pursuant to the Board's authorizations. On April 22, 2021, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on June 25, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2021.For more information on our capital resources and regulatory developments, see Capital Management on page 18.COVID-19 PandemicThe Corporation has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the pandemic. In recent months, COVID-19 vaccination rates have been increasing and restrictive measures have eased in certain areas. However, uncertainty remains about the duration of the pandemic and the timing and strength of the global economy’s recovery. To address the economic impact of the pandemic in the U.S., multiple stimulus packages have been enacted to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which established the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enacted in March 2021. As the pandemic evolves, we continue to evaluate protocols and processes in place to execute our business continuity plans and help promote the health and safety of our employees. We also continue to support the communities we serve by engaging in various initiatives to help those affected by COVID-19.Additionally, we continue to support our clients by providing assistance through various measures to those affected by the pandemic, including by originating PPP loans. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 278,000 PPP loans outstanding with a carrying value of $21.1 billion, which were recorded in the Consumer, GWIM and Global Banking segments. Since the PPP’s inception through April 22, 2021, we have received $12.1 billion in repayment from the SBA. Additionally, we have originated $8.7 billion in PPP loans year to date through April 22, 2021.Although the macroeconomic and public health outlooks improved in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2021, the future

direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens, including as the result of the spread of the more easily communicable variants of COVID-19, this macroeconomic environment could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition.For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic in the MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.LIBOR and Other Benchmark RatesFollowing the 2017 announcement by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that it would no longer compel participating banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021, regulators, trade associations and financial industry working groups have identified recommended replacement rates for LIBOR, as well as other Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), and have published recommended conventions to allow new and existing products to incorporate fallbacks or that reference these Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs). In March 2021, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced the dates for the cessation of all LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the ICE Benchmark Administration. The FCA confirmed that publication of all Euro and Swiss Franc LIBOR settings and most British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen LIBOR settings will cease or become no longer representative of the underlying market the rates seek to measure (i.e., non-representative) immediately after December 31, 2021, and most U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023.The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide IBOR transition program. As part of this transition program, in March 2021, the Corporation ceased offering adjustable-rate mortgages linked to LIBOR and began offering Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-linked adjustable-rate consumer mortgages. On April 1, 2021, the Corporation ceased the initiation of new GBP LIBOR-linked loans, bonds, securitizations and linear derivatives that expire after the end of 2021, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, in April 2021, the Corporation issued a $1 billion six-month floating-rate bank note referencing the one-month Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index to multiple investors. The Corporation continues to update its operational models, systems, processes and internal infrastructure.  The Corporation also continues to work towards meeting the regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones on cessation of LIBOR; however, the market and client replacement of IBORs and adoption of ARRs continue to evolve and, as a result, could impact the ability of market participants and the Corporation to transition activity across or within categories of contracts, products, services and markets. Accordingly, the Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones, development and adoption of SOFR, credit-sensitive and other rates, access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products, and IBOR continuity beyond December 2021. Furthermore, U.S. and U.K. banking regulators have stated that they expect to increase

regulatory scrutiny and intensify supervisory focus of financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness.For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors – Other of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. Net income was $8.1 billion, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 billion, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the same period in 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income.Total assets increased $150.4 billion from December 31, 2020 to $3.0 trillion primarily driven by an increase in debt securities due to cash deployed from continued deposit inflows, as well as higher trading account assets driven by an increase in inventory in Global Markets, partially offset by a decrease in loans and leases due to continued paydowns. Total liabilities increased $149.3 billion from December 31, 2020 to $2.7 trillion primarily driven by an increase in deposits due to additional government stimulus measures as well as seasonally higher deposits, an increase in trading account liabilities resulting from higher levels of short positions in Global
Bank of America  4


Markets and higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase driven by client activity in Global Markets.Shareholders’ equity increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to net income and issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as well as market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income decreased $1.9 billion to $10.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 65 basis points (bps) to 1.68 percent. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by the deployment of excess cash into debt securities. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41.
Noninterest Income

Noninterest income increased $2.0 billion to $12.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The following highlights the significant changes.●    Card income increased $163 million primarily driven by increased client activity, merchant services and higher income related to the processing of unemployment insurance.●    Service charges decreased $111 million primarily due to higher deposit balances driven by additional government stimulus measures.●    Investment and brokerage services income increased $305 million primarily driven by higher market valuations and higher assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.●    Investment banking fees increased $858 million primarily driven by higher equity issuance and advisory fees.

●    Market making and similar activities increased $722 million primarily due to strong trading performance in credit, mortgage and municipal products, and gains in commodities from market volatility driven by a weather-related event, partially offset by reduced activity in other macro products. In addition, the prior-year period included market-related write-downs due to the pandemic.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses improved $6.6 billion to a benefit of $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan balances. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38.
Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased $2.0 billion to $15.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to elevated net COVID-19 costs, acceleration of expenses due to incentive compensation award changes, an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, higher revenue-related expenses and higher severance costs.
Income Tax Expense

The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 were primarily driven by recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. Excluding tax credits related to our ESG investment activity, our effective tax rate would have been 23 percent for the first quarter of 2021.

Supplemental Financial DataNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and  investment  models  use  both  return  on  average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows:●    Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●    Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●    Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5.For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 18. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments’ operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Banking ResultsNet income for Consumer Banking increased $891 million to $2.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an improvement in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $942 million to $5.9 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $118 million to $2.1 billion driven by a decline in service charges primarily due to higher deposit balances and lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results, partially offset by higher card income due to increased client activity.The provision for credit losses improved $2.9 billion to a benefit of $617 million primarily due to a reserve release, as the macroeconomic outlook improved and our credit quality remained strong. Noninterest expense increased $635 million to $5.1 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate rationalization, incremental expense to support customers and employees during the pandemic, the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform.The return on average allocated capital was 28 percent, up from 19 percent, driven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Deposits
Net income for Deposits decreased $1.0 billion to $674 million primarily driven by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income declined $670 million to $3.3 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $186 million to $898 million primarily driven by lower service charges due to higher deposit balances, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results.The provision for credit losses decreased $41 million to $74 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $484 million to $3.2 billion driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, continued investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the pandemic.Average deposits increased $186.0 billion to $917.3 billion driven by strong organic growth and additional government stimulus measures of $112.1 billion in checking and time deposits and $73.1 billion in traditional savings and money market savings.The table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

Consumer investment assets increased $112.3 billion to $324.5 billion driven by market performance and client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two million reflecting continuing changes in our customers’ banking preferences. We had a net increase of 27 financial centers as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network.
Consumer Lending
Net income for Consumer Lending was $2.0 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined $272 million to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest income increased $68 million to $1.3 billion primarily driven by higher card income due to increased client activity.The provision for credit losses improved $2.8 billion to a benefit of $691 million primarily due to a reserve release, as the macroeconomic outlook improved and our credit quality remained strong. Noninterest expense increased $151 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the pandemic.Average loans decreased $25.2 billion to $286.3 billion primarily driven by a decline in credit cards and residential mortgage. In addition, the prior-year period excluded PPP loans, which we began originating in the second quarter of 2020.The table below provides key performance indicators for Consumer Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the total risk-adjusted margin increased 135 bps compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by higher net interest margin and fee income. Total credit card purchase volumes increased $212 million to $64.6 billion as spending began to recover, with improvements in retail, warehouse and services, while travel remained suppressed. Debit card purchase volumes increased $19.3 billion to $107.9 billion due to the impacts of government stimulus measures, tax refunds and continued retail growth from the pandemic recovery.

For more information about GWIM, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Net income for GWIM of $881 million remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, as higher noninterest income and improvement in the provision for credit losses were largely offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income. The operating margin remained relatively unchanged at 23 percent compared to a year ago.Net interest income decreased $240 million to $1.3 billion due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of strong deposit and loan growth. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $275 million to $3.6 billion primarily due to higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.The provision for credit losses improved $254 million to a benefit of $65 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $263 million to $3.9 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentives and investments in primary sales professionals.The return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, down from 23 percent, due to an increase in allocated capital. Average loans increased $9.9 billion to $188.5 billion primarily driven by securities-based lending, custom lending and residential mortgage. Average deposits increased $63.0 billion to $326.4 billion primarily driven by inflows resulting from client responses to market volatility and lower spending.MLGWM revenue of $4.2 billion increased three percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates.Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $786 million decreased nine percent primarily driven by the realignment of certain business results to MLGWM and the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and AUM flows.Bank of America  12

For more information about Global Banking, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Net income for Global Banking increased $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense.Revenue increased $33 million to $4.6 billion driven by higher noninterest income, largely offset by lower net interest income.Net interest income decreased $632 million to $2.0 billion primarily driven by lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by higher deposit balances and credit spreads.Noninterest income increased $665 million to $2.7 billion driven by higher investment banking fees and higher valuation driven adjustments on the fair value loan portfolio, debt securities and leveraged loans, partially offset by weather-related impairment charges on certain renewable energy investments.The provision for credit losses improved $3.2 billion to a benefit of $1.1 billion primarily driven by a reserve release due to the improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $463 million reflecting higher revenue-related incentives, as well as an acceleration in expenses from incentive compensation award changes.The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from one percent, due to higher net income.

Business Lending revenue decreased $407 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower loan balances and interest rates, as well as weather-related impairment charges on certain renewable energy investments. Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $360 million driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher deposit balances.Average loans and leases decreased 17 percent driven by client paydowns and decreased new originations due to lower demand. Average deposits increased 27 percent primarily driven by elevated balances from prior-year inflows on client responses to market volatility and government stimulus measures.Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global   Markets.   To   provide   a  complete  discussion  of  our

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets, including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6.Net income for Global Markets increased $349 million to $2.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Net DVA losses were $2 million compared to gains of $300 million during the same period in 2020. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $579 million to $2.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue and improvement in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue increased $1.0 billion to $6.2 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue increased $443 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $745 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities.The provision for credit losses improved $112 million to a benefit of $5 million primarily due to the improved macroeconomic outlook.Noninterest expense increased $612 million to $3.4 billion driven by volume-related expenses in both card and sales and trading, as well as an acceleration in expenses from incentive compensation award changes.Average total assets increased $10.2 billion to $723.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 as reductions in FICC were more than offset by higher client balances in Global Equities. Period-end total assets increased $129.1 billion from December 31, 2020 Bank of America  16to $745.7 billion driven by higher client balances and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Global Equities and higher levels of inventory in FICC.The return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, up from 19 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.Sales and Trading RevenueFor a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Results for All Other improved $744 million to net income of $257 million from a net loss of $487 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvement in provision for credit losses and revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.The provision for credit losses improved $161 million to a benefit of $47 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.Noninterest expense increased $67 million primarily due to higher technology costs.The income tax benefit increased $609 million reflecting a higher level of income tax credits associated with increased ESG investment activities.  Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 11 – Long-term Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and Warranties ObligationsFor more information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Managing RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation’s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line-of-business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned.For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pandemic-related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2020 CCAR supervisory stress tests, we are subject to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period (the sum of our CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In April 2021, we submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has announced that it will disclose CCAR capital plan supervisory stress test results by July 1, 2021.Due to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve required large banks to suspend share repurchase programs during the second half of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit common stock dividends to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that beginning in the first quarter of 2021, large banks would be permitted to pay common stock dividends at existing  rates  and  to  repurchase  shares  in  an  amount that, Bank of America  18when combined with dividends paid, did not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. On January 19, 2021, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2021. The Board also authorized the repurchase of $2.9 billion in common stock through March 31, 2021, plus repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The Board’s authorization equaled the maximum amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the period. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the period.On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases currently in place will end for most banks after June 30, 2021, following the completion of 2021 supervisory stress tests. Banks, including the Corporation, with capital levels above those required by the stress tests will no longer be subject to the additional restrictions as of July 1, 2021, and will be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve’s SCB framework. On April 15, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time. The Board also authorized repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. For the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation’s repurchase plans will be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s guidance that common stock repurchases and common stock dividends, when combined, should be limited to the average of the last four quarters’ net income. Following the expiration of the Federal Reserve's restrictions, the Corporation expects to return additional capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends pursuant to the Board's authorizations. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases made pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of March 31, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach.Minimum Capital RequirementsIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer or SCB, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital.The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and RatiosTable 7 presents Bank of America Corporation’s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.(3)Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(4)Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.(5)Supplementary leverage exposure reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks for both periods. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021.At March 31, 2021, CET1 capital was $177.8 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by earnings, partially offset by common stock repurchases, dividends and lower net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). Total capital under the Standardized approach decreased $1.9 billion primarily driven by  a  decrease   in  the  adjusted   allowance  for  credit  losses included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by the same factors driving the increase in CET1 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at March 31, 2021, increased $28.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $1,508 billion primarily due to strong client activity in Global Markets and investments of excess liquidity.

Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements  as  prescribed  in  the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital  ratios and SLR,  the Corporation  is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

Supplementary Leverage RatioOn March 19, 2021, the U.S. banking regulators announced that the temporary change to the SLR for BHCs and depository institutions issued in 2020 would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation’s lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation’s SLR was 7.0 percent. Excluding the temporary relief, the SLR would have been approximately 6.1 percent, which is 1.1 percent, or $35 billion, in excess of the 5.0 percent required by the Federal Reserve.Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At March 31, 2021, BofAS had tentative net capital of $15.2 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $12.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.9 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At March 31, 2021, MLPCC’s regulatory net capital of $5.9 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At March 31, 2021, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $3.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $175 million.Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2021, MLI’s capital resources were $33.9 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.3 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2021, BofASE's capital resources were $5.8 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $2.2 billion.Liquidity RiskFunding and Liquidity Risk ManagementOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
NB Holdings Corporation
We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets
Table 12 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.Our bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $294 billion and $306 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and

transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.Table 13 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $577 billion and $584 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 117 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.
Liquidity Stress Analysis
We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule
On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule is effective July 1, 2021. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured
Bank of America  24depository institutions. The Corporation expects to be in compliance within the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline provided and does not expect any significant impacts to the Corporation.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.88 trillion and $1.80 trillion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded  on  a  secured  basis  through   securities   lending  and repurchase agreements, and  these  amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions.Long-term DebtDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021, we issued $13.1 billion of long-term debt consisting of $8.1 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $1.3 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $3.7 billion of other debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $13.9 billion consisting of $9.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $922 million for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.4 billion of other debt. Table 14 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2021.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk – Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2)     Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Total long-term debt decreased $11.7 billion to $251.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to debt maturities and redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we issued $1.1 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar  to  our  other  unsecured  long-term  debt.  We  could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding.

For more information regarding such guarantees by the Corporation, see Liquidity Risk – Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Risk ManagementFor information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 31, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 37, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38, and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the economy gained momentum as unemployment continued to decline from double-digit highs during 2020 and parts of the economy continued to open as vaccination rates increased, case levels showed improvements and restrictions generally began to ease. Individuals and businesses in the U.S. continue to receive various forms of support through economic stimulus packages enacted in 2020 and 2021. While there has been improvement, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the economy's recovery, which could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. For more information on how the pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Item 1A. Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential  judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioThe economic environment improved during the three months ended March 31, 2021, with the U.S. unemployment rate continuing to decline and home prices increasing. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, deferral activity led to an increase in nonperforming loans, while net charge-offs decreased $179 million to $693 million primarily due to lower credit card losses as balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020.The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $1.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $8.6 billion due to an improved economic outlook and loan balance declines. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, as well as interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Bank of America  26Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 16 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.

For more information on non-core loans, see Consumer Credit Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2)Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage includes $527 million and $537 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $201 million and $225 million of loans on which interest was still accruing.(3)Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $45.4 billion and $46.4 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $42.4 billion and $41.1 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.(4)Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $275 million and $298 million and home equity loans of $418 million and $437 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 52 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2021. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 41 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association, as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $8.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as paydowns were partially offset by originations. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the residential mortgage portfolio included $12.0 billion and $11.8 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. Table 18 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2021, $1.3 billion, or 53 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $88 million.  Net recoveries of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same period in 2020.Of the $202.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2021, as shown in Table 19, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $5.6 billion, or 10 percent, at March 31, 2021. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2021, $113 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.1 billion, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2021, $302 million, or five percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $112 million were contractually current, compared to $2.4 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 98 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later.Table 19 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 16 percent of outstandings at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1)Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Home Equity At March 31, 2021, the home equity portfolio made up eight percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.At March 31, 2021, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances  in  the  home  equity  portfolio  decreased $2.2 billion Bank of America  28during the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $13.2 billion, or 41 percent, and $13.8 billion, or 40 percent, were in first-lien positions. At March 31, 2021, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were  in  a  second-lien  or  more  junior-lien position  and wherewe also held the first-lien loan totaled $5.4 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $41.6 billion and $42.3 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The HELOC utilization rate was 42 percent and 43 percent at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.Table 20 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics.

(3)Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. (4)These vintages of loans accounted for 36 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $20 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by COVID-19 deferral activity. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2021, $261 million, or 39 percent were current on contractual payments. In addition, $252 million, or 38 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $17 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021.Net recoveries increased $24 million to $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices. Of the $32.1 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2021, as shown in Table 20, 15 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $8.6 billion at March 31, 2021. The HELOCs that have entered the  amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2021, $109 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had  entered the amortization period  were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2021, $484 million, or six percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, 18 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $5.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $72.8 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes and higher payments. Net charge-offs decreased $136 million to $634 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to net charge-offs of $770 million for the same period in 2020 as balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $372 million, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $148 million primarily due to charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020 and the impact of government stimulus measures. Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $346.7 billion at March 31, 2021 from $342.4 billion at December 31, 2020.Table 22 presents certain state concentrations for the credit card portfolio.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, nonperforming consumer loans increased $366 million to $3.1 billion primarily driven by consumer real estate deferral activity. At March 31, 2021, $841 million, or 27 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at March 31, 2021, $1.6 billion, or 51 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are  now  current  after  successful  trial  periods,  or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties decreased $22 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $101 million as the Corporation has paused formal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied properties during 2021.Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 24. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the pandemic, most of which are not TDRs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, and included $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $339 million and $361 million of loans classified as performing.(2)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of loans that were fully-insured.(3)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $417 million and $407 million, and include $236 million and $216 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $181 million and $191 million of loans classified as performing.In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer’s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $692 million and $701 million, of which $609 million and $614 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our
31 Bank of America




non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 30, 33 and 36 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 33 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 35.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio as well as interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Commercial Credit PortfolioDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021, commercial asset quality reflected signs of stabilization as the economic recovery gained momentum amid COVID-19 containment and vaccination progress. Accordingly, charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. While total commitments increased, outstanding loans decreased driven by paydowns given continued market liquidity. We had $21.1 billion of PPP loans outstanding with our small business clients at March 31, 2021, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in the tables in this section. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun to stabilize in many sectors as economies have reopened; however, certain sectors, including hospitality and retail, continue to be negatively impacted due to the pandemic. Moreover, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties.The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $1.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $7.5 billion due primarily to an improved macroeconomic outlook and loan balance declines. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38.Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $12.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $608.1 billion driven by lower loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at March 31, 2021 and 57 percent at December 31, 2020.Table 26 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and IndustrialCommercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios.U.S. CommercialAt March 31, 2021, 63 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 20 percent in Global Markets, 15 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking. U.S. commercial loans, including fair value option loans, decreased $4.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 driven by Global Banking. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $3.2 billion, which was broad-based across industries.Non-U.S. CommercialAt March 31, 2021, 77 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 23 percent in Global Markets. Non-U.S. commercial loans, including fair value option loans, was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2021. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 37.Commercial Real EstateCommercial  real  estate  primarily  includes  commercial  loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans declined by $1.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as paydowns exceeded new originations. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms.For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Table 30 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Of the U.S. small  business  commercial  net  charge-offs,  90 percent  were credit card-related products for both of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 31 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $156 million to $2.1 Bank of America  34billion. At March 31, 2021, 82 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 56 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 85 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

Industry Concentrations Table 33 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry.  For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Risk Mitigation. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $12.2 billion, or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $1.1 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Telecommunication services, Finance companies, Asset managers and funds, and Software and services industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Government and public education and Capital goods  industry sectors.For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $106.7 billion, increased $5.1 billion, or five percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $90.6 billion, decreased $1.8 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 34.Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $78.4 billion, decreased $2.6 billion, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Given the widespread impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries have been and may

continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. The impact of the pandemic has also placed significant stress on global demand for oil, resulting in a steep decline in prices for much of 2020. However, oil prices rebounded late in the fourth quarter of 2020 and early in the first quarter of 2021. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $558 million, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $32.4 billion, driven by declines in energy equipment and services as well as oil, gas and consumable fuels. For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.
Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion. We recorded net losses of $36 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to net gains of $229 million for the same period in 2020 for these same positions. The gains and losses on  these  instruments  were  offset  by gains and losses on the

related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 39. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 40.Tables 34 and 35 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 36 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2021. These exposures accounted for 91 percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $23.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with the central bank of Japan and increased corporate exposure in Canada.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at March 31, 2021 was the U.K. with net exposure of $58.8 billion, which represents a $685 million decrease from December 31, 2020. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $43.5 billion at March 31, 2021, a $1.4 billion decrease from December 31, 2020.In light of the global pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will likely continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact to  our  international  business  operations as part of our overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. While vaccines have become more widely available in certain countries, the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. The impact of the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on the pandemic, see Item 1A.

Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses decreased by $2.7 billion from December 31, 2020 to $18.0 billion at March 31, 2021, which included a $1.2 billion reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio and a $1.4 billion reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio. The decreases were primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook and loan balance declines.The table below presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type for March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial  instruments  associated  with our operations, primarily

within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results.We have been affected, and may continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Table 39 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid  trading  positions)  portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 39 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.Table 39 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 39 and Table 40 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in diversification benefit between asset classes.

(1)The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant.The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 39.


Bank of America  40Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 40 at the same level of detail as in Table 39. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a  predefined statistical distribution. Table 40 presents  average  trading  VaR  statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020. The increase in VaR for the 99 percent confidence level for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to pandemic-related market volatility, which impacted the 99 percent VaR average more severely than the 95 percent VaR average compared to the same period in 2020.

BacktestingThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management – Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents  the  total  amount  earned  from  trading   positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $24 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 74 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $6 million.


Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book
The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 41 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Table 42 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel  3,  see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 19.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 42. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant.Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation’s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $13 million and $163 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of
Bank of America  42gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Climate Risk ManagementClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories:  (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change. The financial impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk. Physical risk can also lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or collateral values. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. For more information on our governance framework and climate risk management process, see the Managing Risk and the Climate Risk Management sections in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Other of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Bank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The nature of the Corporation’s business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results, have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest IncomeThe table below presents the Corporation’s net interest income and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Offsetting of DerivativesThe Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. For more information, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash.

Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).Fair Value HedgesThe table below summarizes information related to fair value hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

The table below summarizes the carrying value of hedged assets and liabilities that are designated and qualifying in fair value hedging relationships along with the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying value that have been recorded in the current hedging relationships. These fair value hedging adjustments are open basis adjustments that are not subject to amortization as long as the hedging relationship remains designated.

(1)Increase (decrease) to carrying value.(2)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the cumulative fair value adjustments remaining on long-term debt and available-for-sale debt securities from discontinued hedging relationships resulted in an increase in the related liability of $2.1 billion and $3.7 billion and a decrease in the related asset of $71 million and $69 million, which are being amortized over the remaining contractual life of the de-designated hedged items.(3)These amounts include the amortized cost of the prepayable financial assets used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship (i.e. last-of-layer hedging relationship). At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $30.5 billion and $34.6 billion, of which $7.0 billion was designated in the last-of-layer hedging relationship at both dates. At March 31, 2021, the cumulative adjustment associated with these hedging relationships was a decrease of $115 million. At December 31, 2020, the cumulative adjustment was insignificant.(4)Carrying value represents amortized cost. (5)Represents hedging activities related to precious metals inventory.
Cash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe table below summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Of the $688 million after-tax net loss ($917 million pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at March 31, 2021, gains of $220 million after-tax ($294 million pretax) related to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net gains reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily increase net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 3 years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 15 years.

Other Risk Management Derivatives
Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging various assets and liabilities. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense recorded on the hedged item.

Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives
The Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation had transferred $5.1 billion and $5.2 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.1 billion and $5.2 billion at the transfer dates. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion.
Sales and Trading Revenue
The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.


The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).

Credit Derivatives
The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. For more information on credit derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.Credit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.

Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralCertain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $89.3 billion and $96.5 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $72.7 billion and $88.6 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. For more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.At March 31, 2021, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $3.0 billion, including $1.9 billion for Bank of America, National Association.Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.The following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at March 31, 2021 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by

one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.

Any changes in value are reported in market making and similar activities. For detail on the components, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements. (3)Includes securities pledged as collateral of $78.0 billion and $65.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.  (4)The Corporation held debt securities from Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) that each exceeded 10 percent of shareholders’ equity, with an amortized cost of $312.6 billion and $164.2 billion, and a fair value of $312.1 billion and $162.1 billion at March 31, 2021, and an amortized cost of $260.1 billion and $118.1 billion, and a fair value of $267.5 billion and $120.7 billion at December 31, 2020.

At March 31, 2021, the accumulated net unrealized gain on AFS debt securities, excluding the amount related to debt securities previously transferred to held to maturity, included in accumulated OCI was $3.8 billion, net of the related income tax expense of $1.3 billion. The Corporation had nonperforming AFS debt securities of $20 million at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $236.1 billion and $200.0 billion in AFS debt securities, which were primarily U.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities that have a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining $34.5 billion in AFS debt securities at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the amount of expected credit losses was insignificant. Substantially all of the Corporation's HTM debt securities are U.S. agency MBS and have a zero credit loss assumption. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation held equity securities at an aggregate fair value of $758 million and $769 million and other equity securities, as valued under the measurement alternative, at a carrying value of $255 million and $240 million, both of which are included in other assets.

Consumer nonperforming loans increased to $3.1 billion at March 31, 2021 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 driven by consumer real estate deferral activity.The following table presents the Corporation’s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

Credit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which measures the carrying value of the Corporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers  (e.g.,  borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of financing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at March 31, 2021, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an additional credit decision after origination or through a TDR.

For more information on the criteria for classifying loans as TDRs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
65 Bank of America




Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Consumer Real EstateModifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.Consumer real estate loans of $358 million that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at March 31, 2021, of which $103 million were classified as nonperforming and $65 million were loans fully insured. Consumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reach 180 days past due prior to modification are charged off to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they are modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR.At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $101 million and $123 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at March 31, 2021 was $1.1 billion. Although the Corporation has paused formal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied properties, during the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation reclassified $10 million of consumer real estate loans completed or which were in process prior to the pause in foreclosures, to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The table below presents the March 31, 2021 and 2020 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had previously been classified as TDRs and were modified again during the period.

Credit Card and Other ConsumerThe Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer’s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. The table below provides information on the Corporation’s Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the March 31, 2021 and 2020 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 12 percent of new credit card TDRs and 20 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Commercial LoansModifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the Corporation’s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $680 million and $876 million.  At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion of commercial TDRs with remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors of $364 million and $402 million. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $198 million and $218 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.Loans Held-for-saleThe Corporation had LHFS of $7.9 billion and $9.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $9.9 billion and $7.5 billion for the  three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled approximately $8.3 billion and $6.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.Accrued Interest ReceivableAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $2.4 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation reversed $158 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan.For the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation reversed $8 million of interest and fee income at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded. For more information on the Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends.  For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The March 31, 2021 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic outlooks that included consensus estimates, multiple downside scenarios that Bank of America  68


assumed a significantly longer period until economic recovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario to reflect the continued improvement in the consensus outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumed that the U.S. unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be relatively consistent with the level as of March 2021, which was slightly above six percent.  Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product was assumed to return to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021. The allowance for credit losses considered the impact of enacted government stimulus measures and continued to factor in the uncertainty resulting from the unprecedented nature of the current health crisis and risks that may prevent a full economic recovery. The Corporation also factored into its allowance for credit losses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments that included leveraged loans and industries such as travel and entertainment, which have been adversely impacted by the effects of the pandemic, as well as the energy sector. The allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2021 was $18.0 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook and loan balance declines. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $2.6 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $49 million decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to $182 million in the consumer real estate portfolio, $1.3 billion in the credit card and other consumer portfolio, and $1.2 billion in the commercial portfolio. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option decreased $25.1 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2021, driven by consumer loans, which decreased $16.5 billion primarily due to a decline in consumer real estate due to prepayments in a low rate environment and a decline in credit card loans from seasonality and higher payments. The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the table below.

NOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its customers’ financing and investing needs. The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise  has  a  variable  interest  in  the  VIE. The tables also present the Corporation's maximum loss exposure at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 resulting from its involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. For more information on the Corporation's use of VIEs and related maximum loss exposure, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 – Securities or Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities. The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or the year ended December 31, 2020

Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.(2)A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $33 million and $27 million net of hedges, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are not included in the table above.(3)The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $149.7 billion and $182.9 billion at March 31, 2021 and 2020. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $113 million and $128 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $2.2 billion at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1)For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies.(2)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $5.0 billion and $7.6 billion of seller’s interest.
(3)The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller’s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests, in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts. No new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. No subordinate securities were issued by the credit card securitization trust during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $1.0 billion and $7.4 billion of securities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $178 million and $526 million. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at March 31, 2021 was 6.5 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Customer VIEsCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEsThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $288 million and $298 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.Investment VIEsThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $780 million and $494 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $5.9 billion and $5.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VIEsThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $22.4 billion and $22.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.The Corporation’s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $11.2 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $5.0 billion, at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $393 million and $268 million and reported pretax losses in other income of $276 million and $272 million. These tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation’s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.Bank of America  72

Restricted CashAt March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.5 billion and $7.0 billion, predominantly related to cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve requirements.NOTE 10 Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Extension CommitmentsThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.9 billion and $10.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The carrying value of these commitments at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, excluding commitments  accounted  for  under  the  fair  value option, was $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, which primarily related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $4.6 billion and $4.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes cumulative net fair value of $91 million and $99 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation’s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.

For more information, see Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities.
(4)    Includes business card unused lines of credit. Other CommitmentsAt March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $138 million and $93 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $726 million and $645 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $430 million and $582 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation  had  commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $119.0 billion and $66.5 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $60.6 billion and $32.1 billion. These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months.At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $3.9 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2022 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $7.1 billion. At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,  the  Corporation’s  maximum  exposure  related to these guarantees totaled $1.1 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant ServicesThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable regulatory and card network rules, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation processed an aggregate purchase volume of $301.1 billion. The Corporation’s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant. The Corporation continues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic impacts of the pandemic. Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesFor more information on representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and is included in accrued
Bank of America  76expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo ProgramThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $3.4 billion and $22.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.Other GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payments under these agreements are approximately $9.2 billion and $8.8 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2049. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees. For more information on maximum potential future payments under VIE-related liquidity commitments, see Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities. In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Guarantees of Certain Long-term DebtThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosures supplement the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matter described below and the matters disclosed in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.  Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $34 million and $24 million was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.For any matter disclosed in this Note and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation’s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $1.3 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of March 31, 2021. The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.Information is provided below, or in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matter described below, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be

(1)In 2021, and through April 29, 2021.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation repurchased and retired 101 million shares of common stock, which reduced shareholders’ equity by  $3.5 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued 63 million shares of its common stock and, to satisfy tax withholding obligations, repurchased 24 million shares of its common stock. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation had reserved 451 million unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, convertible notes and preferred stock. On April 22, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.18 per share.
Preferred Stock
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation declared $490 million of cash dividends on

preferred stock. On January 28, 2021, the Corporation issued approximately 37,000 shares of 4.125% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series PP for $915 million, with quarterly dividends commencing in May 2021. The Series PP preferred stock has a liquidation preference of 25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation fully redeemed Series CC and Series T preferred stock for a total of $1.1 billion. Additionally, on April 25, 2021, the Corporation fully redeemed Series EE preferred stock for $900 million. For more information on the Corporation's preferred stock, including liquidation preference, dividend requirements and redemption period, see Note 13 – Shareholders’ Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restricted Stock Units During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation granted 98 million restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to certain employees under the Bank of America Key Employee Equity Plan. Other than an insignificant amount that are settled in cash, the RSUs will be settled in shares of common stock of the Corporation.  Eighteen million of the RSU awards will vest over three years, and the remainder will generally vest over four years, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time. The RSUs will be expensed ratably over the life of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the grant-date fair value of the shares, except for awards that contain a retirement-eligibility provision and were issued to retirement-eligible employees, as these awards are generally expensed in the year preceding the grant date. Certain RSU awards granted during the three months ended March 31, 2021 were subsequently modified to include a retirement-eligibility provision, resulting in additional compensation and benefits expense of $269 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. For more information, see Note 18 – Stock-based Compensation Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NOTE 13 Earnings Per Common Share
The calculation of earnings per common share (EPS) and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 is presented below. For more information on the calculation of EPS, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 62 million average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L preferred stock were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the “if-converted” method.NOTE 14 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation  determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The table below presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI. Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to decreased price observability, and transfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

Glossary
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data.

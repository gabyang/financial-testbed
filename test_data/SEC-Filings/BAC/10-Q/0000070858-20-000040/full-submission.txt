Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its management may make certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.” Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation’s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under
Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and in any of the Corporation’s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation’s potential judgments, claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory and government actions, including as a result of our participation in and execution of government programs related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; the possibility that the Corporation’s future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, regulatory, and representations and warranties exposures; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased servicing, fraud, indemnity, contribution or other claims from one or more counterparties, including trustees, purchasers of loans, underwriters, issuers, monolines, private-label and other investors, or other parties involved in securitizations; the Corporation’s ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims, including claims brought by investors or trustees seeking to avoid the statute of limitations for repurchase claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs, and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate environment on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations; the possibility that

future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties; the Corporation’s ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of regulations, other guidance or additional information on the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and any similar or related rules and regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach of the Corporation’s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks or campaigns; the impact on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government’s debt limit or changes to the U.S. presidential administration and Congress; the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, including the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and/or global economy, financial market conditions and our business, results of operations and financial condition; the impact of natural disasters, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary.

Based on our results, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. For more information on SCB, see Capital Management on page 23.The Federal Reserve also announced that due to economic uncertainty resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all large banks will be required to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. Large banks will also be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year based on instructions that the Federal Reserve will provide. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional analysis to assess the Corporation's capital plans and will review capital preservation measures on a quarter-by-quarter basis.  The Federal Reserve’s directive regarding share repurchases aligns with our decision to voluntarily suspend repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the announcement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not include repurchases to offset shares awarded under our equity-based compensation plans, for which we repurchased $286 million of common stock during the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to the Board's repurchase authorization under our 2019 CCAR capital plan.On July 22, 2020, the Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend at the existing rate of $0.18 per share. We intend to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at this rate until further notice, subject to approval by the Board. We will also continue our current suspension of common stock repurchases in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans.For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 23. COVID-19 PandemicIn the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activity have been implemented. Additionally, there has been a sharp decline in global economic activity, reduced U.S. and global economic output and a significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally. This has resulted in, among other things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and caused volatility and disruptions in the global financial markets, including the energy and commodity markets. Although some restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas, many of the restrictive measures remain in place or have been reinstated, and in some cases additional restrictive measures are being implemented. Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and global economies have been negatively impacted and are likely to be so for an extended period of time, as there remains significant uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery.In response to the pandemic, the Corporation has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans and help protect its employees and support its clients. The Corporation is managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic according to its Enterprise Response Framework, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the integration of its response. The CEO and key members of the Corporation’s management team meet daily with co-leaders of the Executive Response Team, which is composed of senior executives across the Corporation, to help drive decisions, communications, and consistency of response across all businesses and functions. We are also coordinating with global, regional and local authorities and health experts, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization.Additionally, we have implemented a number of measures to assist our employees, clients and the communities we serve, including the following:




3     Bank of America


Employees
We are providing support to our teammates to help promote the health and safety of our employees, including:●Monitoring guidance from the CDC, medical boards and health authorities and sharing such guidance with our employees. ●Operating our businesses from remote locations and leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities. The Corporation has globally implemented a work-from-home posture, which has resulted in a substantial majority of our employees working from home, and pre-planned contingency strategies for site-based operations for our remaining employees. We continue to evaluate our continuity plans and work-from-home strategy in an effort to best protect the health and safety of our employees.●Providing access to various benefits and resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Clients
We have taken measures to leverage our business continuity plans and capabilities to continue to service our clients and meet our clients’ financial needs, including:●Offering assistance to our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes payment deferrals, refunds of certain fees, pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions, and continuing to provide access to credit and the important financial services on which our clients rely. For more information on payment deferrals, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ●Participating in the programs created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES Act) and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, including originating Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Through the second quarter of 2020, we funded approximately 334,000 PPP loans totaling $25.1 billion, which were recorded in the Consumer, GWIM and Global Banking segments. For more information, see Credit Risk Management on page 31 and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.●Providing access to important financial resources, including 24/7 access to mobile and online banking, with no limits on cash withdrawals, and virtual connection to advisors.

Community partners
We have supported the communities where we live and work by engaging to help those affected through initiatives, including:●Committed $100 million to local communities to purchase medical supplies, food and other priorities.●Committed $250 million in capital to community development financial institutions to fund loans they extend through the PPP. ●Issued a $1 billion, four-year corporate social bond to support the fight against COVID-19, the first such offering by a U.S. commercial bank.●Made a $1 billion, four-year pledge of additional support to address economic and racial inequality accelerated by the global pandemic. The programs will be focused on assisting people and communities of color who have experienced a greater impact from the health crisis.We will continue to manage the increased operational risk related to the execution of our business continuity plans in accordance with our Enterprise Response Framework, Risk Framework and Operational Risk Management Program. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 23.
Loan Modifications
The Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the CARES Act that the Corporation adopted, COVID-19 related modifications to consumer and commercial loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classification under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs. For more information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table provides a summary of the percentage of our loans and loan balances with modifications in place as of July 23, 2020. The modifications were made in response to COVID-19 under payment deferral or forbearance programs, none of which are classified as TDRs. As of the date presented, loan balances of deferred consumer and small business accounts totaled $28.5 billion. Deferred commercial accounts, excluding small business, totaled $7.7 billion.

(1) Mortgage and home equity lines of credit includes loans that are held for investment (owned by Bank of America).(2) Vehicle lending includes both consumer and small business.(3) Statistics represent clients who have been given temporary deferment of principal and/or interest for a defined period of time.We have processed 1.8 million consumer deferral requests, of which 1.4 million were in place as of July 23, 2020. The largest number of processed deferrals has been for consumer and small business credit card holders, of which 85 percent were initiated in late March and April 2020. At the time the deferrals were requested, more than 95 percent of these customers were current. During the second quarter of 2020, approximately 61 percent of these customers have made at least one payment, and 33 percent have made a payment each month since being placed on deferral.Other Related MattersAs part of our ongoing review of our financial condition in light of the pandemic, we evaluated goodwill and other intangibles and equity investments for potential impairment. Based upon our review as of June 30, 2020, no impairments have been recorded. For more information on goodwill, see Complex Accounting Estimates – Goodwill and Intangible Assets on page 50 and Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Given the significant uncertainty regarding the duration and further spread of COVID-19 and rapidly evolving economic effects and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remain highly uncertain. Should current economic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, we expect that this macroeconomic environment will have a continued adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could have an effect on our financial condition. For more information on how the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104.LIBOR and Other Benchmark RatesAs previously disclosed, to facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide program to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As part of this program, the Corporation continues to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR and other  benchmarks, and evaluate and address documentation and contractual mechanics of outstanding IBOR-based products and contracts that may mature after LIBOR is no longer deemed a representative benchmark and new and potential future ARR-based products and contracts to achieve operational readiness.  This program, which is led by the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer, includes active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee. The program is structured to address the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance. As the markets for ARRs continue to grow, the Corporation continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Additionally, the Corporation continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the market and industry transition to ARRs, including the readiness of other market participants and third-party vendors, and impacted clients and their operational readiness to transition to ARRs. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104.Merchant Services Joint VenturePrior to the third quarter of 2020, a significant portion of our merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which we hold a 49 percent ownership interest. In 2019, we delivered notice of termination of the joint venture at the conclusion of its term in June 2020 to the joint venture partner. For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began providing merchant services for the customer relationships received. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, merchant revenue and the related noninterest expense will be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and are not expected to be material.

Financial Highlights
Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses (CECL), under which the allowance is measured based on management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL). Prior-year periods presented reflect measurement of the allowance based on management’s estimate of probable incurred credit losses. For more information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 51. Net income was $3.5 billion and $7.5 billion, or $0.37 and $0.77 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $7.3 billion and $14.7 billion, or $0.74 and $1.45 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2019. The decline in net income was largely due to an increase in the provision for credit losses primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID‐19, and to a lesser extent, lower revenue and an increase in noninterest expense.Total assets increased $307.6 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.7 trillion primarily driven by higher federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and higher cash and cash equivalents as a result of elevated deposit balances being deployed as short-term investments.Total liabilities increased $306.8 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.5 trillion primarily driven by higher deposit inflows resulting from government stimulus actions, lower consumer spending, and client responses to market volatility as clients improved  their  liquidity  positions.  Additionally,  long-term  debt increased due to debt issuances and a debt basis adjustment primarily due to lower interest rates.Shareholders’ equity increased $827 million from December 31, 2019 primarily due to net income and market value increases on debt securities, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends as well as the impact of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income decreased $1.3 billion to $10.8 billion, and $1.6 billion to $23.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 57 basis points (bps) to 1.87 percent, and 39 bps to 2.09 percent for the same periods. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower asset yields from the decline in interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs as well as   Bank of America    6loan and deposit growth. Based on the forward interest rate curve and other relevant assumptions as of June 30, 2020, we expect net interest income to decline modestly in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2020. For more  information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 47.



Noninterest Income
Table 3Noninterest Income                  Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2020 2019 2020 2019Fees and commissions:       Card income$1,249 $1,446 $2,521 $2,821Service charges1,562 1,903 3,465 3,742Investment and brokerage services3,422 3,470 7,180 6,830Investment banking fees2,159 1,371 3,547 2,635Total fees and commissions8,392 8,190 16,713 16,028Market making and similar activities2,487 2,381 5,294 5,149Other income599 324 108 347Total noninterest income$11,478$10,895$22,115$21,524
Noninterest income increased $583 million to $11.5 billion, and $591 million to $22.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The following highlights the significant changes.●Card income decreased $197 million and $300 million primarily driven by lower levels of consumer spending due to the impact of COVID-19.●Service charges decreased $341 million and $277 million primarily due to lower overdraft charge rates and client activity due to the impact of COVID-19.●Investment and brokerage services income decreased $48 million for the three-month period primarily due to lower market valuations and assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM flows. For  the six-month period, there was an increase of $350 million primarily due to higher client transactional activity, higher market valuations and AUM flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.●Investment banking fees increased $788 million and $912 million due to higher debt and equity underwriting fees and higher advisory fees.

●Market making and similar activities increased $106 million and $145 million. For the three-month period the improvement was primarily due to increased client activity and market recoveries from the end of the prior quarter, partially offset by lower income in equity derivatives from a weaker trading performance. The increase in the six-month period was primarily driven by higher client activity, partially offset by valuation adjustments in credit-sensitive products.●Other income increased $275 million for the three-month period and decreased $239 million for the six-month period. The increase was primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans, partially offset by certain valuation adjustments. The decrease in the six-month period was primarily due to net unrealized losses in the fair value option and leveraged finance portfolios.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion, and $8.0 billion to $9.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily driven by increased ECL due to a weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44.
Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased $142 million to $13.4 billion, and $393 million to $26.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the net impact of COVID-19 expense after considering related savings, partially offset by other cost reductions.

Income Tax Expense
Table 5Income Tax Expense                  Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2020 2019 2020 2019Income before income taxes$3,799 $8,959 $8,330 $17,726Income tax expense266 1,611 787 3,067Effective tax rate7.0%18.0%9.4%17.3%
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were driven by our recurring tax preference benefits, primarily consisting of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges. The six-month effective rates also included tax benefits from deductions associated with share-based compensation. The declines in the effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits on the lower levels of pretax income. We expect the effective tax rate for the rest of 2020 to be approximately 11 percent, excluding the change in U.K. tax law discussed below and other unusual items.  Absent these tax credits, we would expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25 percent. On July 22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a change in its tax rates under which the Corporation will record an income tax benefit of approximately $700 million in the third quarter of 2020. For more information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Supplemental Financial DataNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows:●Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 51.
Key Performance Indicators
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 103.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 23. The capital allocated to the business segments  is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments’ operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

For more information about Consumer Banking, including our Deposits and Consumer Lending businesses, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Banking ResultsThree-Month Comparison Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $3.2 billion to $71 million primarily due to higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue. Net interest income decreased $1.1 billion to $6.0 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $741 million to $1.9 billion driven by a decline in service charges and card income primarily due to fewer overdrafts and lower client activity, as well as lower other income driven by the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results.The provision for credit losses increased $2.1 billion to $3.0 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $321 million to $4.7 billion primarily driven by incremental expense to support customers and employees during COVID-19, as well as the cost  of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth. The return on average allocated capital was one percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income, and to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.Six-Month Comparison Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $4.7 billion to $1.9 billion primarily due to higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue.Net interest income decreased $1.4 billion to $12.9 billion and noninterest income decreased $1.0 billion to $4.1 billion. The declines were primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.The provision for credit losses increased $3.4 billion to $5.3 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $449 million to $9.2 billion primarily driven by incremental expense to support customers and employees during COVID-19, the cost of increased client activity, and continued investments for business growth, partially offset by improved productivity. The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital.DepositsThree-Month ComparisonNet income for Deposits decreased $1.4 billion to $785 million driven by lower revenue. Net interest income declined $1.1 billion to $3.3 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $485 million to $763 million. The decline in noninterest income was primarily driven by lower service charges due to fewer overdrafts, fee waivers and lower client activity related to the impact of COVID-19 as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results.The provision for credit losses increased $110 million to $154 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $194 million to $2.9 billion driven by continued investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.Average deposits increased $102.6 billion to $804.4 billion. The increase was driven by strong organic growth of $76.1 billion in checking and time deposits and $26.5 billion in traditional savings and money market savings. Six-Month ComparisonNet income for Deposits decreased $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion driven by lower revenue. Net interest income declined $1.4 billion to $7.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income decreased $646 million to $1.8 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.The provision for credit losses increased $179 million to $269 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $264 million to $5.6 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.Average deposits increased $70.8 billion to $767.8 billion. The increase was driven by strong organic growth of $56.2 billion in checking and time deposits and $14.6 billion in traditional savings and money market savings.The following table provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and mobile/digital trends.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, total credit card purchase volumes declined $16.6 billion to $53.7 billion, and $15.0 billion to $118.1 billion compared to the same periods in 2019. Debit card purchase volumes declined $1.6 billion to $89.6 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in  2019. The declines in credit card and debit card purchase volumes were driven by lower levels of consumer spending due to the impact of COVID-19. Debit card purchase volumes began to improve late in the second quarter of 2020 as businesses reopened and consumers used their cards for more essential spending, as well as retail, services and restaurant spending. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, debit card purchase volumes increased $2.0 billion to $178.2 billion, driven by higher levels of consumer spending in the first quarter and again in June 2020.

The decrease was primarily driven by lower transactional revenue, lower market valuations, and declines in AUM pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM flows.The provision for credit losses increased $115 million to $136 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense remained relatively unchanged at $3.5 billion.The return on average allocated capital was 17 percent, down from 30 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital.

Business Lending revenue decreased $196 million and $355 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by the impact of higher loan and lease balances. Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $350 million and $509 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by the impact of higher deposit balances.Average loans and leases increased 12 percent and 8 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Average deposits increased 36 percent and 23 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to client responses to market volatility, government stimulus and placement of credit draws. Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the following table presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking.

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in  both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Bank of America    20The following explanations for current period-over-period changes in results for Global Markets, including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, exclude net DVA, but the explanations would be the same if net DVA were included. Revenue amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8.Three-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Markets increased $849 million to $1.9 billion. Net DVA losses were $261 million compared to losses of $31 million. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $1.0 billion to $2.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses.Revenue increased $1.2 billion to $5.3 billion as sales and trading revenue increased $909 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $1.1 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue across Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities. The prior-year period included a $199 million gain  on the sale of an equity investment.The provision for credit losses increased $100 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense remained relatively unchanged at $2.7 billion. Average total assets decreased $22.3 billion to $663.1 billion driven by lower average client balances and increased balance sheet efficiency in Global Equities.The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from 12 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by a small increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12. Six-Month ComparisonNet  income  for  Global  Markets  increased $1.5 billion to $3.6 billion. Net DVA gains were $39 million compared to losses of $121 million. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $1.4 billion to $3.6 billion. These increases were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.Revenue increased $2.2 billion to $10.6 billion as sales and trading revenue increased $2.1 billion, and excluding net DVA, increased $1.9 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue across FICC and Equities.The provision for credit losses increased $230 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $62 million to $5.5 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses.Average total assets increased $13.3 billion to $688.1 billion primarily due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. Period-end total assets increased $10.3 billion since December 31, 2019 to $652.1 billion primarily driven by Equities resulting from a change in composition of equity hedges for client activity versus year end.The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent, up from 12 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by a small increase in allocated capital.Sales and Trading RevenueFor a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8.

FICC net DVA losses were $245 million and gains of $29 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to losses of $30 million and $109 million for the same periods in 2019. Equities net DVA losses were $16 million and gains of $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to losses of $1 million and $12 million for the same periods in 2019.Three-Month ComparisonFICC revenue increased $1.1 billion driven by strong results across credit-related products, especially in the Americas, as prices recovered from the first quarter of 2020, combined with solid market-making conditions across macro products. Equities revenue increased $81 million driven by a strong  performance in cash and client financing, partially offset by a weaker performance in derivatives. Six-Month ComparisonFICC revenue increased $1.4 billion driven by increased client activity and improved market making-conditions across macro products, partially offset by weaker performances in credit-sensitive businesses. Equities revenue increased $552 million driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in a more volatile market environment.

(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders’ equity. Average allocated assets were $740.7 billion and $656.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $549.5 billion and $543.0 billion for the same periods in 2019, and period-end allocated assets were $829.1 billion and $565.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For information on our merchant services joint venture, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – Merchant Services Joint Venture on page 5 and Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $10.6 billion to $11.1 billion due primarily to loan sales. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, total non-core loans decreased $1.6 billion to $14.1 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances and sales, partially offset by repurchases. For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 31.Three-Month ComparisonNet income for All Other increased $207 million primarily driven  by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the benefit in the provision for credit losses.Revenue increased $241 million primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans, partially offset by lower net interest income and equity investment income.Noninterest expense decreased $207 million to $309 million reflecting a decrease in compensation and benefits, lower non-core mortgage costs, primarily due to lower volume, and lower technology costs.The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $220 million to $21 million from the prior period, which included higher recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off consumer real estate loans.The income tax benefit decreased $21 million reflecting the impact of lower pretax losses. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Six-Month ComparisonThe net loss for All Other increased $251 million, driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.Revenue decreased $107 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments on securities and derivatives and extinguishment losses on certain structured liabilities, partially offset by a gain on sales of mortgage loans.The provision for credit losses increased $388 million to $93 million due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion.Noninterest expense decreased $360 million to $556 million due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.The income tax benefit decreased $116 million reflecting lower discrete tax benefits. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.  Bank of America    22Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 12 – Long-term Debt and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and Warranties ObligationsFor more information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Managing RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation’s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned.For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104. These COVID-19 related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information on capital management, including related regulatory requirements,  see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve notified BHCs of their 2020 CCAR supervisory stress test results. Based on our results, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period (the sum of our CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our preliminary SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that due to economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, all large banks will be required to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares issued under equity compensation plans, and limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. Large banks will also be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year based on instructions that the Federal Reserve will provide. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional analysis to assess the Corporation’s capital plans and will review capital preservation measures on a quarter-by-quarter basis.The Federal Reserve’s directive regarding share repurchases aligns with our decision to voluntarily suspend repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the announcement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not include repurchases to offset shares issued under our equity compensation plans, for which we repurchased $286 million of common stock during the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to the Board’s repurchase authorization under our 2019 CCAR capital plan. For more information, see Capital Management -- CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We intend to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.18 per share until further notice, subject to approval by the Board. We will also continue our current suspension of common stock repurchases in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares issued under equity compensation plans. Our repurchase program is subject to the Board’s approval, and at such time that we reinstate our stock repurchase program, our stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). For more information, see Regulatory Developments in this section.Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of June 30, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total Capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Advanced approaches.Minimum Capital RequirementsIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. Beginning October 1, 2020, the capital conservation buffer will be replaced by the SCB for the Corporation’s Standardized approach ratio  requirements. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital.The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.Capital Composition and RatiosTable 9 presents Bank of America Corporation’s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $10.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital, increases in excess eligible credit reserves included in Tier 2 capital and the  issuance of preferred stock. Risk-weighted assets under the Advanced approaches, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at June 30, 2020, increased $57.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $1,504 billion primarily due to changes in corporate risk ratings, increased counterparty credit risk and market risk RWA.Table 10 shows the capital composition at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.  Bank of America    24

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements
Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the  Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 13 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC risk-weighted assets and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.(3) The long-term debt risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation’s method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.(4) The approach that yields the higher risk-weighted assets is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which were the Advanced approaches as of June 30, 2020 and the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2019.(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at June 30, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.(6) Derivative exposure amounts are calculated using the standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk at June 30, 2020 and the current exposure method at December 31, 2019.  Bank of America    26Regulatory DevelopmentsThe following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management – Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revisions to Basel 3 to Address Current Expected Credit Loss AccountingOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. For more information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the first quarter of 2020, in accordance with an interim final rule issued by U.S. banking regulators, the Corporation delayed for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). For more information, see Capital Management – Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended  March 31, 2020.Stress Capital BufferOn March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that integrates the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the U.S. Basel 3 Final Rule. The new approach replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for Basel 3 Standardized approach requirements with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decline in the CET1 capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, floored at 2.5 percent. Based on the CCAR 2020 supervisory stress test results, the Corporation will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. In conjunction with this new requirement, the Federal Reserve has removed the annual CCAR quantitative objection process beginning with CCAR 2020. While the final rule continues to require that the Corporation describe its planned capital distributions in its CCAR capital plan, the Corporation is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its CCAR capital plan. The Corporation is instead subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements, which include the stress capital buffer.Supplementary Leverage RatioOn April 1, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule to temporarily exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of supplementary leverage exposure for bank holding companies. The rule is effective for June 30, 2020 through March 31, 2021 reports. As of June 30, 2020, temporary exclusions improved the supplementary leverage ratio by 0.9 percent to 7.1 percent. On May 15, 2020, the U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that provides a similar temporary exclusion to depository institutions, effective from the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 through March 31, 2021; however, institutions must elect the relief. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, a depository institution electing to apply the exclusion must receive approval from its primary regulator prior to making any capital distributions  as long as the exclusion is in effect. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries have not elected the exclusions. Paycheck Protection Program LoansOn April 9, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued an interim final rule that, among other things, stipulates PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, will receive a zero percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches. For more information on the PPP, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Standardized Approach for Measuring Counterparty Credit RiskAs of June 30, 2020 the Corporation adopted the new standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), which replaces the current exposure method for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for risk-weighted assets and supplementary leverage exposure. Adoption of SA-CCR resulted in a decrease of approximately $15 billion in the Corporation’s Standardized risk-weighted assets,  and a $66 billion decrease in supplementary leverage exposure.Swap Dealer Capital RequirementsOn July 22, 2020, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a final rule to establish capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to existing U.S. prudential regulation. Under the rule, applicable subsidiaries of the Corporation would be permitted to elect one of two approaches to compute their regulatory capital. The first approach is a bank-based capital approach which requires that firms maintain CET1 capital greater than or equal to 6.5 percent of the entity’s RWA as calculated under Basel 3, Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity’s RWA as calculated under Basel 3 and Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity’s uncleared swap margin. The second approach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm maintain net capital greater than or equal to 2.0 percent of  uncleared swap margin. The final rule also includes reporting requirements. The impact to the Corporation is not expected to be significant.Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to CFTC Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than




27     Bank of America


Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At June 30, 2020, BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.4 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $16.6 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.0 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At June 30, 2020, MLPCC’s regulatory net capital of $7.4 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.2 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At June 30, 2020, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $4.4 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $134 million.Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2020, MLI’s capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $13.8 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2020, BofASE's capital resources were $5.5 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $1.7 billion.Liquidity RiskFunding and Liquidity Risk ManagementOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress that began in the first quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic  on  page 3.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed

below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
NB Holdings Corporation
We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.
We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.Our bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $340 billion and $372 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade

securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.
Table 15 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $549 billion and $464 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 121 percent and 116 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.

Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.72 trillion and $1.43 trillion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions.Long-term DebtDuring the six months ended June 30, 2020, we issued $30.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $26.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $817 million of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $3.7 billion of other debt, substantially all of which were structured liabilities.During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $20.4 billion consisting of $6.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $8.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.4 billion of other debt. Table 16 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2020.

Total long-term debt increased $20.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 47.We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we issued $5.3 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings,

financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 12 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit RatingsCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 18 presents the Corporation’s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.On April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its review of the large, complex securities trading and universal banks in the U.S., including Bank of America, in response to declining economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation and all of its rated subsidiaries, except for select issuer and instrument level ratings that had previously been placed under criteria observation (UCO) on March 4, 2020, following changes in the agency’s bank rating criteria on February 28, 2020.Concurrently, Fitch reached a conclusion on select UCO designations for the Corporation and upgraded the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of MLI and BofASE by one notch to AA-/F1+. The agency also upgraded the preferred stock rating of the Corporation by one notch to BBB and downgraded the subordinated debt rating of the Corporation by one notch to A-. According to Fitch, rating changes UCO are the sole result of bank rating criteria change and do not reflect a change in the underlying fundamentals of the institution. Fitch’s rating outlook for all our long-term ratings is currently Stable.On June 9, 2020, Fitch affirmed as A the subordinated debt rating of BANA. This rating had remained UCO following Fitch’s broader rating actions.The ratings and outlooks from Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed in the  Corporation's  2019  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K.For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

While we experienced increases in Commercial nonperforming loans and reservable criticized exposures as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from COVID-19, we did not see meaningful impacts to Consumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits.  To provide relief to individuals and businesses in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law  four economic stimulus packages, including the CARES Act. U.S. bank regulatory agencies also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19.To support our customers, we have implemented various loan modification programs and other forms of support, including offering loan payment deferrals, refunding certain fees and pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions. For a summary of the loan modification programs that we have implemented along with a summary of deferral requests that have been executed, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3. For information on the accounting for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to  quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioAlthough COVID-19 is severely impacting economic activity, it did not have a meaningful impact on the consumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits but there may be adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods if negative economic conditions continue. Net charge-offs increased $43 million and $80 million to $734 million and $1.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by lower consumer real estate loan sale recoveries.The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $6.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $11.0 billion due to the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 19 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.

(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, residential mortgage includes $590 million and $740 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $264 million and $348 million of loans on which interest was still accruing.(2) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $48.4 billion and $50.4 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $36.6 billion and $36.7 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.(3) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $330 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $354 million and $337 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $7 million and $6 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.Table 20 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

(1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise  underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 21 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other.As shown in Table 21, outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $3.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by an increase of $4.4 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in home equity.

(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $330 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $354 million and $337 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For more information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) The home equity non-core allowance is in a negative position at June 30, 2020 as it includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off.(3) Home equity allowance includes a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $141 million at June 30, 2020.  Bank of America    32We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 53 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2020. Approximately 54 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 37 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association  as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $3.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 as retention of new originations was partially offset by both loan sales and runoff. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.7 billion and $18.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $3.1 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. The decline was primarily driven by sales of loans with FHA insurance during the three months ended June 30, 2020.Table 22 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR.(3) These vintages of loans accounted for $435 million, or 28 percent, and $365 million, or 25 percent, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $82 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by the inclusion of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2020, $628 million, or 40 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $397 million driven by both government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with the economic impact of COVID-19, as well as seasonal declines.Net charge-offs decreased $23 million and $8 million to a net recovery of $20 million and $21 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. This decrease is due largely to loan sales that generated a recovery of $16 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020.  Of the $227.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2020, as shown in Table 22, 26 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $6.6 billion, or 11 percent, at June 30, 2020. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of  early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2020, $87 million, or one percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $899 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2020, $295 million, or four percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $111 million were contractually current, compared to $1.6 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later.Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both  June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 14 percent and 13 percent of outstandings at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Home Equity At June 30, 2020, the home equity portfolio made up nine percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.At June 30, 2020, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $35.9 billion, or 94 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $37.5 billion, or 93 percent, at December 31, 2019. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans.At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, or three percent, of the total home equity portfolio. At June 30, 2020, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.4 billion, or three percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.5 billion, or four percent, at December 31, 2019.  At June 30, 2020, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to  paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $14.7 billion, or 38 percent, and $15.0 billion, or 37 percent, were in first-lien positions. At June 30, 2020, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $6.6 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home equity portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $44.4 billion and $43.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by new production, partially offset by accounts closed voluntarily. The HELOC utilization rate was 45 percent and 46 percent at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.Table 24 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics.

For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $20 million and $30 million and nonperforming loans include $62 million and $57 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.(3) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. (4) These vintages of loans accounted for 35 percent and 34 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $58 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by an increase in loans that were current on their contractual payments, as well as the inclusion of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2020, $266 million, or 45 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $201 million, or 34 percent, of nonperforming home  equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $44 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020.Net charge-offs increased $141 million to a net recovery of $14 million, and $119 million to a net recovery of $25 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 as the prior-year period included recoveries from non-core home equity loan sales. Of the $38.4 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2020, as shown in Table 24, 15 percent require   Bank of America    34interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $10.6 billion at June 30, 2020. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2020, $124 million, or one percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2020, $438 million, or four percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure  before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, 18 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $13.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $84.2 billion due to lower retail spending. Net charge-offs decreased $97 million to $665 million and $72 million to $1.4 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19. Credit card loans 30 days or  more past due and still accruing interest decreased $615 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $260 million primarily due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals along with declines in loan balances associated with COVID-19. Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $348.1 billion at June 30, 2020 from $336.9 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by lower purchase volumes. Table 26 presents certain state concentrations for the credit card portfolio.

Outstandings in the  direct/indirect portfolio decreased $2.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $88.6 billion primarily due to lower originations in Auto.Table 27 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, nonperforming consumer loans increased $138 million to $2.2 billion primarily driven by the inclusion of $135 million of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. At June 30, 2020, $730 million, or 33 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at June 30, 2020, $934 million, or 43 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after  successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties decreased $60 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $169 million as liquidations outpaced additions. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 28. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, and included $698 million and $748 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $415 million and $468 million of loans classified as performing.(2) At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion of loans that were fully-insured.(3) At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $422 million and $442 million, and include $209 million and $209 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $213 million and $233 million of loans classified as performing.In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer’s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio).Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 28 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $677 million and $679 million, of which $601 million and $570 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 34, 37 and 40 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 41 and Table 37.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.For information on the accounting for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Credit PortfolioDuring the six months ended June 30, 2020, commercial asset quality weakened as a result of the economic impact from COVID-19. However, there were also positive signs during this period. Of the draws by large corporate and commercial clients contributing to the $67.2 billion loan growth in the first three months of 2020, $62.0 billion was repaid as emergency or contingent funding was no longer needed or clients were able to access capital markets. Additionally, as part of the CARES Act, we funded $25.1 billion of PPP loans for our small business clients, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in the tables in this section. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable but various sectors continued to experience varying degrees of strain as a result of COVID-19. Hospitality and retail sectors have been most negatively impacted. Many real estate markets experienced disruption in demand, supply chain challenges and underlying tenant difficulties.The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses increased $3.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $8.4 billion due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44.Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $32.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $667.7 billion driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 60 percent at June 30, 2020 and 58 percent at December 31, 2019.Table 30 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $10.4 billion, or 125 percent, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and was broad-based across industries.Non-U.S. CommercialAt June 30, 2020, 82 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 17 percent in Global Markets. Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily in Global Banking. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 43.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on  the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $1.4 billion, or two percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $64.1 billion due to new originations and increased utilizations under existing credit facilities outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of weakness in the non-residential portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Table 34 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 50 percent and 52 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 95 percent and 92 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 99 percent and 97 percent for the same periods in 2019.Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 35 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases  and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $703 million to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19. At June 30, 2020, 87 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 65 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 81 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.  Bank of America    40

Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming.(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance.(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 36 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days  past due. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry Concentrations Table 37 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $2.8 billion, less than one percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $1.1 trillion. The decrease in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset managers and funds, Utilities, and Global commercial banks industry sectors. Decreases were partially offset by increased exposure to the Healthcare equipment and services, Capital goods, and Automobiles and components industry sectors.For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $100.8 billion, decreased $9.3 billion, or eight percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $96.1 billion, remained relatively flat  during the six months ended June 30, 2020. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 39.Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $85.7 billion, increased $4.8 billion, or six percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 with the growth largely occurring in the machinery, and aerospace and defense conglomerates categories, partially offset by a decrease in trading companies and distributors, and industrial conglomerates. Given the widespread impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries, which are continuing to experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. In addition, we continue to assess potential mitigants such as the various stimulus programs designed to support these clients and industries through COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also placed significant stress on global demand for oil, resulting in a steep decline in prices. Our energy-related committed exposure increased $1.1 billion, or three percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $37.4 billion, driven  by our integrated client exposure, partially offset by a decline in our higher risk exploration and production exposure. For more information on COVID-19, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.

Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $5.4 billion and $3.3 billion. We recorded net losses on these positions of $231 million and $2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to net losses of $13 million and $77 million for the same periods in 2019. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these

exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 43. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 46.Tables 38 and 39 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.Table 40 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2020. These exposures accounted for 90 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $43.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Germany and Japan.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at June 30, 2020 was the U.K. with net exposure of $61.0 billion, which represents a $5.2 billion increase from December 31, 2019. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $49.9 billion at June 30, 2020, a $19.1 billion increase from December 31, 2019. The increase in Germany was primarily driven by an increase in deposits with the central bank. In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact  to our international business operations as part of our overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. The impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104.Allowance for Credit LossesOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation’s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a net increase of $3.3 billion in the allowance for credit losses which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $310 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net  increase was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase related to the credit card portfolio. The allowance for credit losses further increased by $7.6 billion at June 30, 2020, which included a $4.5 billion increase in the commercial portfolio and a $3.1 billion increase in the consumer portfolio. The increases were primarily due to the weaker economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type for June 30, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard).

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $330 million at June 30, 2020 and $257 million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and home equity loans of $354 million at June 30, 2020 and $337 million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $5.1 billion, $5.1 billion and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively and non-U.S. commercial loans of $3.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.(2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $1.4 billion, $831 million and $523 million at June 30, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion compared to $887 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2019 driven by increases in commercial losses. The provision for credit losses increased $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion, and $8.0 billion to $9.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion and $7.6 billion higher than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, which was primarily due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.0 billion to $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion to $4.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The  provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019.The following table presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, noting that measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 2019 was based on management’s estimate of probable incurred losses.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results.We have been affected, and expect to continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Table 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.Table 43 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 using a 99 percent confidence level, as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to the impact of market volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic in the look-back period.

(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant.The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 43. Peak VaR in mid-March 2020 was driven by increased market realized volatility and higher implied volatilities.


Bank of America    46Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 44 at the same level of detail as in Table 43. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 44 presents average  trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019. The increase in VaR for the 99 percent confidence level for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to higher model volatility based on March 2020 market data included in the calibration of the VaR model.

BacktestingThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management – Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, there were zero days and seven days respectively where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 94 percent of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.


Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book
The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Table 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.In the six months ended June 30, 2020, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased in up-rate scenarios primarily due to lower rates and higher cash levels. Asset sensitivity of our balance sheet decreased in down-rate scenarios due to interest rate floors. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 23.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.

The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book  in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net results on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were a gain of $454 million and a loss of $496 million, on a pretax basis, at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These gains (losses) are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2020, the after-tax net gains are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: a gain of $189 million within the next year, a gain of $298 million in years two through five, a loss of $96 million in years six through ten, with the remaining loss of $59 million thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2020.Table 47 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest swaps decreased, primarily driven by lower swap rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term debt.

Foreign exchange contracts of $(53.1) billion at December 31, 2019 were comprised of $29.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(82.4) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(313) million in foreign currency-denominated interest rate swaps and $644 million in foreign currency futures contracts.(6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information  on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we recorded gains of $65 million and $228 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of  gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $78 million and $139 million for the same periods in 2019.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as noted below under Allowance for Credit Losses, there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the MD&A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Allowance for Credit LossesOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets.The Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios, adjusted for expected prepayments and borrower controlled extension options. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends.The Corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data.The allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio, deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real estate portfolio.  In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19 into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. As described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated.  Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2020, goodwill

recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was as follows.

We perform goodwill impairment testing at least annually, unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2020. In performing that test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit based on the income approach (which utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value) and the market multiplier approach (which utilizes observable market prices and metrics of peer companies to estimate fair value). Our discounted cash flows were generally based on the Corporation’s three-year internal forecasts with a long-term growth rate of 3.68 percent. Our estimated cash flows take into account the current challenging global industry and market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the low interest rate environment. The cash flows were discounted using rates that range from 9 percent to 12 percent, which were derived from a capital asset pricing model that incorporates the risk and uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts, the financial markets and industries similar to each of the reporting units. Under the market multiplier approach, we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units utilizing various market multiples, primarily various pricing multiples, from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit and then factored in a control premium based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change-in-control transactions for financial institutions.Based on the results of the test, we determined that each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value and that the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit, as of June 30, 2020, was not impaired. The fair values of the reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from 109 percent to 213 percent. As it currently remains difficult to predict the economic impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our impairment analysis. It is possible that, during the remainder of 2020, economic and market conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could further deteriorate, which could negatively impact our reporting units. If our key assumptions and related estimates change, we may be required to record an impairment charge in the future.

Bank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2019  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.The nature of the Corporation’s business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results, have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.New Accounting StandardsReference Rate ReformIn March 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to contracts or hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The new standard provides for optional expedients and other guidance regarding the accounting related to modifications of contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Corporation has elected to retrospectively adopt the new standard as of January 1, 2020 which resulted in no immediate impact. While reference rate reform is not expected to have a material accounting impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations, the standard will ease the  administrative burden in accounting for the future effects of reference rate reform.Accounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit LossesOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in the Corporation’s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase to the allowance for credit losses. After adjusting for deferred taxes and other adoption effects, a $2.4 billion decrease was recorded in retained earnings through a cumulative-effect adjustment.Accounting Principles for Credit LossesThe following summarizes the Corporation’s accounting policies for certain credit loss activities.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments and represents management’s estimate of the ECL in the Corporation’s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.For loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance.In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends.The estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan   Bank of America    56has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.The allowance for loan and lease losses for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) is measured based on the present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan’s collateral value or its observable market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.The Corporation has identified the following three portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.Consumer Real EstateTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation’s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the Corporation’s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn  portion of the Corporation’s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default.For loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate.For loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation’s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off amount.Credit Cards and Other ConsumerCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.CommercialThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan’s contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower’s draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The commercial real estate model also utilizes key economic variables to forecast market indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the expected credit loss estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower’s current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower’s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, credit risk spreads, asset prices and equity market returns.In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.Securities The Corporation evaluates each available-for-sale (AFS) security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss. Any credit losses determined are recognized as an increase to the allowance for credit losses through provision expense recorded in other income. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as, remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.The Corporation separately evaluates its held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities for any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. Other AssetsFor the Corporation’s financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.Troubled Debt RestructuringsThe Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are not classified as TDRs. In addition, for loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that do not meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states that loan modifications performed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrower’s past due and nonaccrual status will not be impacted during the deferral period. Interest income will continue to be recognized over the contractual life of the loan. For more information on the Corporation's TDR accounting, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Paycheck Protection ProgramThe Corporation is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The PPP is designed to provide U.S. small businesses with cash-flow assistance through loans fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). If the borrower meets certain criteria and uses the proceeds towards certain eligible expenses, the borrower’s obligation to repay the loan can be forgiven up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest. Upon borrower forgiveness, the SBA pays the Corporation for the principal and accrued interest owed on the loan. If the full principal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan will operate according to the original loan terms with the 100 percent SBA guaranty remaining. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation had funded approximately 334,000 loans under the PPP totaling $25.1 billion. As compensation for originating the loans, the Corporation receives lender processing fees from the SBA, which are   Bank of America    58capitalized, along with the loan origination costs, and will be amortized over the loans’ contractual lives and recognized as interest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan and repayment by the SBA, any unrecognized net capitalized fees and costs related to the loan will be recognized as interest income in that period.Accounting Principles for GoodwillGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of any goodwill impairment to be based on the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered impaired. Previously, the amount of impairment was based on a comparison of the reporting unit’s implied fair value of goodwill to the reporting unit’s assigned amount of goodwill.  During the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation performed a quantitative analysis for its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2020.  For more information on the results of the Corporation's test, see Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets. For more information on accounting for goodwill, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Subsequent EventsOn July 22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a repeal of the final two percent of scheduled decreases in the U.K. corporation tax rate, which had been previously enacted. This change will unfavorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, and requires a remeasurement of the Corporation's U.K. net deferred tax assets using the higher tax rate. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation will record an income tax benefit of approximately $700 million along with a corresponding increase to the U.K. net deferred tax assets.

Offsetting of DerivativesThe Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. For more information, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on  which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash.

ALM and Risk Management DerivativesThe Corporation’s asset and liability management (ALM) and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. For more information on ALM and risk management derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest  rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).Fair Value HedgesThe following table summarizes information related to fair value hedges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.  Bank of America    62

At June 30, 2020, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $45.2 billion, of which $8.4 billion was designated in the hedging relationship. The cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships were $135 million.
(4) Carrying value represents amortized cost.
Cash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe following table summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Of the $332 million after-tax net gain ($441 million pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at June 30, 2020, gains of $189 million after-tax ($250 million pretax) related to open cash flow hedges are expected to be  reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net gains reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily increase net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 3 years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 16 years.

Other Risk Management Derivatives
Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging various assets and liabilities. The following table presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense recorded on the hedged item.

(4) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in compensation and benefits expense.
Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through DerivativesThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation had transferred $5.2 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.2 billion at both transfer dates. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion.Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client  transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 17 – Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The table below is not presented on an FTE basis.

Bank of America    64Credit DerivativesThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations  of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.

The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.

Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralCertain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $89.0 billion and $84.3 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $85.3 billion and $69.1 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. For more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. At June 30, 2020, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $2.2 billion, including $1.3 billion for Bank of America, National Association.Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.The following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at June 30, 2020 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.

Any changes in value are reported in other income. For detail on the components, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements. (3) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation reclassified AFS debt securities with a fair value of $16.2 billion and $60.6 billion to HTM.(4) Includes securities pledged as collateral of $58.7 billion and $67.0 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
(5) The Corporation held debt securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that each exceeded 10 percent of shareholders’ equity, with an amortized cost of $154.8 billion and $51.0 billion, and a fair value of $162.6 billion and $53.5 billion at June 30, 2020, and an amortized cost of $157.2 billion and $54.1 billion, and a fair value of $160.6 billion and $55.1 billion at December 31, 2019.
At June 30, 2020, the accumulated net unrealized gain on AFS debt securities, excluding the amount related to debt securities previously transferred to held to maturity, included in accumulated OCI was $4.8 billion, net of the related income tax expense of $1.6 billion. The Corporation had nonperforming AFS debt securities of $25 million and $9 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.Effective January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard for credit losses that requires evaluation of AFS and HTM debt securities for any expected losses with recognition of an allowance for credit losses, when applicable. For more information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. At June 30, 2020, the Corporation had $153.9 billion  in AFS debt securities, which were primarily U.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities that have a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining $36.6 billion in AFS debt securities, the amount of ECL was insignificant. Substantially all of the Corporation's HTM debt securities are U.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities and have a zero credit loss assumption. At June 30, 2020, the Corporation held equity securities at an aggregate fair value of $798 million and other equity securities, as valued under the measurement alternative, at cost of $225 million, both of which are included in other assets. At June 30, 2020, the Corporation also held equity securities at fair value of $1.2 billion included in time deposits placed and other short-term investments.

The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the Corporation’s underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios.The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on loans totaling $8.6 billion and $7.5 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans. Nonperforming Loans and LeasesCommercial nonperforming loans increased to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2020 from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 with broad-based increases across multiple industries. The Corporation did not see meaningful impacts to consumer portfolio delinquencies and nonperforming loans during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits.The table below presents the Corporation’s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Nonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For information on the Corporation's interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. For more information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 residential mortgage includes $590 million and $740 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $264 million and $348 million of loans on which interest was still accruing.(3) At June 30, 2020, Residential Mortgage and Home Equity include negative allowance on nonperforming loans of $155 million and $106 million.

Included in the June 30, 2020 nonperforming loans are $119 million and $16 million of residential mortgage and home equity loans that prior to the January 1, 2020 adoption of the new credit loss standard were not included in nonperforming loans as they were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Credit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using CLTV which measures the carrying value of the Corporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more  frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at June 30, 2020, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an additional credit decision after origination or through a TDR.  Bank of America    72

As a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, commercial asset quality weakened during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased to $26.0 billion at June 30, 2020 from $11.5 billion (to 4.51 percent from 2.09 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2019 with increases spread across multiple industries.Troubled Debt RestructuringsThe Corporation began entering into loan modifications with borrowers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have not been classified as TDRs, and therefore are not included in the discussion below. For more information on the criteria for classifying loans as TDRs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.  Consumer Real EstateModifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment  terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.Consumer real estate loans of $396 million that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at June 30, 2020, of which $98 million were classified as nonperforming and $75 million were loans fully insured. Consumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reach 180 days past due prior to modification are charged off to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they are modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance   Bank of America    74for loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR.At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $169 million and $229 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at June 30, 2020 was $1.4 billion. Although the Corporation has paused formal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales, during the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation reclassified $154 million of consumer real estate loans completed or which were in process  prior to the pause in foreclosures, to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The table below presents the June 30, 2020 and 2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had previously been classified as TDRs and were modified again during the period.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer’s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that  provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. The table below provides information on the Corporation’s Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the June 30, 2020 and 2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 14 percent of new credit card TDRs and 22 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Commercial LoansModifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while  mitigating  the  Corporation’s risk exposure. Reductions in  interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. For more information on modifications for the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, see Credit Card and Other Consumer in this Note.At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were $500 million and $445 million. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was not significant at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.  Bank of America    76Loans Held-for-saleThe Corporation had LHFS of $7.4 billion and $9.2 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $11.1 billion and $14.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled approximately $9.2 billion for both the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.Accrued Interest ReceivableAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged-off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation reversed $141 million and $306 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan.For the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation reversed $8 million and $18 million of interest and fee income at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded. For more information on the Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Allowance for Credit LossesOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation’s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in the allowance for credit losses, which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase in credit card as the Corporation now reserves for the life of these receivables. The increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments included $119 million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn portion of HELOCs and $191 million in the commercial portfolio. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.The allowance for loan and lease losses at June 30, 2020 was $19.4 billion, an increase of $7.0 billion compared to January 1, 2020. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was $393 million in the consumer real estate portfolio, $2.7 billion in the credit card and other consumer portfolio, and $3.9 billion in the commercial portfolio. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased $579 million from January 1, 2020 to $1.7 billion at June 30, 2020. The allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies, including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.The lifetime estimate considers several recessionary scenarios that include deterioration in key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate and home price index over the life of the portfolio. As of January 1, 2020, the Corporation's economic outlook was weighted to include the potential of a recession with some expectation of tail risk similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, there was significant deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally related to impact of COVID-19. This has resulted in changes to key macroeconomic variables, including, but not limited to, increases in the unemployment rate and decreases to the forecasted gross domestic product compared to the Corporation's January 1, 2020 outlook. The weakened economic outlook was the primary driver of the Corporation’s increase in the allowance for credit losses. In establishing the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020, the Corporation used an economic outlook derived from weighting consensus estimates, a downside scenario that assumed a significantly slower recovery in order to reflect the uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the current crisis, and a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing.  The unemployment rate under this economic outlook remained above 10 percent as of the fourth quarter of 2020 with a gradual decline to above seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Additionally, in this economic outlook, gross domestic product did not return to pre-pandemic levels until the beginning of 2023.  The Corporation factored into its allowance for credit loss estimate the impact to borrowers from additional unemployment benefits that were provided as part of the CARES Act, including a probability-weighted likelihood of an extension of benefits into the fourth quarter of 2020.In addition, the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 included qualitative reserves for certain segments that the Corporation views as higher risk that may not be fully recognized through its quantitative models. These high risk segments include leveraged loans and higher risk industries such as hospitality and energy. The Corporation also holds additional reserves for borrowers who requested deferrals that take into account their credit characteristics and payment behavior subsequent to deferral.  There are still many unknowns including the duration of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the results of the current government fiscal and monetary actions including payment deferral programs as well as future government actions. The Corporation will continue to evaluate the allowance for credit losses and the related economic outlook each quarter.Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $14.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Outstanding commercial loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $29.0 billion primarily due to $25.1 billion of funded PPP loans and growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Outstanding consumer loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option decreased $14.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by a decline in credit card  due to reduced consumer spending. The funding of PPP loans did not impact the allowance for credit losses as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA. The decline in consumer loans and leases somewhat offset the increase in the allowance for credit driven by the weaker economic outlook. The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Bank of America    78The provision for credit losses, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion, and $8.0 billion to $9.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 driven by deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. At June 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses for the Corporation’s other relevant assets was insignificant.NOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its customers’ financing and investing needs. The tables in this Note present the assets, liabilities and maximum loss exposure of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. For more information on the Corporation's use of VIEs and related maximum loss exposure, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 7 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain  commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 – Securities or Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the six months ended June 30, 2020 or the year ended December 31, 2019 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $933 million and $1.1 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties. Except as described in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties.  The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the GSEs or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $34 million and $61 million, net of hedges, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $11 million and $19 million for the same periods in 2019, are not included in the table above.
(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $183.4 billion and $210.5 billion at June 30, 2020 and 2019. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $124 million and $252 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $144 million and $292 million for the same periods in 2019. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $430 million and $1.1 billion. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation completed the sale of $9.3 billion of consumer real estate loans through GNMA loan securitizations. As part of the securitizations, the Corporation retained $8.4 billion of mortgage-backed securities, which are classified as debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales of $704 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.The following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies.(2) At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $9.1 billion and $10.5 billion of seller’s interest.(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to  provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend   Bank of America    80on the undrawn portion of the HELOCs, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller’s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts. No new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.0 billion and $7.4 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. No subordinate securities were issued by the credit card securitization trust during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $10.7 billion and $18.1 billion of securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $4.1 billion and $8.5 billion for the same periods in 2019. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and,  accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $4.4 billion and $4.9 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $1.5 billion and $2.8 billion for the same periods in 2019, of which substantially all of the securities in the prior-year period were classified as trading account assets. Of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during the three months ended June 30, 2020, $654 million, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively. Of the securities received as resecuritizations proceeds during the six months ended June 30, 2020, $1.2 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively. Substantially all of the trading account securities and debt securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at June 30, 2020 was 7.0 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Customer VIEsCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty,  net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEsThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation’s

81     Bank of America


maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $245 million and $304 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.Investment VIEsThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $601 million and $104 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $35.1 billion and $32.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $6.3 billion and $6.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.7 billion at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VIEsThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $19.6 billion and $18.9 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.The Corporation’s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $10.3 billion and $10.0 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $4.6 billion and $4.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. The Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $342 million and $610 million and reported pretax losses in other income of $255 million and $527 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. For the same periods in 2019, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $291 million and $571 million and reported pretax losses in other income of $234 million and $482 million. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation’s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year’s expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from 25 percent. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.

Amortization of intangibles expense was $16 million and $32 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $29 million and $55 million for the same periods in 2019.

NOTE 8 Leases
The Corporation enters into both lessor and lessee arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 9 – Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on lease financing receivables, see Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Lessor Arrangements
The Corporation’s lessor arrangements primarily consist of operating, sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term.At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the total net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases was $20.4 billion and $21.9 billion, comprised of $17.9 billion and $19.3 billion in lease receivables and $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in unguaranteed residuals. In certain cases, the Corporation obtains third-party residual value insurance to reduce its residual asset risk. The carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $6.2 billion and $5.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. At June 30, 2020, the carrying value of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $1.7 billion, including deferred revenue of $17 million and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2019, the comparable amounts were $829 million, $16 million and $813 million, respectively.

Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to  insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant ServicesIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. If a merchant processor fails to meet its obligation regarding disputed transactions, then the Corporation could be held liable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the sponsored entities processed $183.1 billion and $386.9 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $6 million and $13 million. For the same periods in 2019, the sponsored entities processed $235.7 billion and $441.3 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $7 million and $11 million.At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled $307.9 billion and $384.2 billion. However, the Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure.A significant portion of the Corporation's merchant processing activity is performed by a joint venture, formed in 2009, in which the Corporation holds a 49 percent ownership interest. The carrying value of the Corporation’s investment was $614 million and $640 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and reported in All Other. On July 29, 2019, the Corporation gave notice to the joint venture partner of the termination of the joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term in June 2020. As a result, the Corporation incurred a non-cash, pretax impairment charge in 2019 of $2.1 billion, included in other general operating expense. Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began providing merchant services for the customer relationships received. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, merchant revenue and the related noninterest expense will be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and are not expected to be material.Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesFor more information on representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on our experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation. Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo ProgramThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $3.8 billion and $9.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.Other GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payments under these agreements are approximately $8.8 billion and $8.7 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2049. The Corporation  has made no material payments under these guarantees. For more information on maximum potential future payments under VIE-related liquidity commitments, see Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities. In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Guarantees of Certain Long-term DebtThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosure supplements the disclosure in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure). In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or any eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $57 million and $81 million was recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $114 million and $187 million for the same periods in 2019.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, for which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates these matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. With respect to such matters, in cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed   Bank of America    86

85     Bank of America





matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those disclosed matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, as well as for representations and warranties exposures, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for these exposures is $0 to $1.6 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any. The estimated range of possible loss, as well as the Corporation's accrued liability, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range of possible loss and liability accrual are unpredictable and will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate or accrual. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.Information is provided below, or in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matter described below, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation’s businesses or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm.

In June 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) announced that due to economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19,  all large banks will be required to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ net income. The Federal Reserve’s directive regarding share repurchases aligns with the Corporation's decision to voluntarily suspend repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the announcement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The suspension of the Corporation's repurchases did not include repurchases to offset shares awarded under its equity-based compensation plans. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation repurchased and retired 12 million and 212 million shares of common stock in connection with the Board of Directors' (the Board) 2019 repurchase authorizations, which reduced shareholders’ equity by $286 million and $6.6 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued 63 million shares of its common stock and, to satisfy tax withholding obligations, repurchased 24 million shares of its common stock. At June 30, 2020, the Corporation had reserved 516 million unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, convertible notes and preferred stock. On July 22, 2020 the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend at the existing rate of $0.18 per share.Preferred StockDuring the three months ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the Corporation declared $469 million and $249 million of cash dividends on preferred stock, or a total of $718 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. For more information on the Corporation's preferred stock, including liquidation preference, dividend requirements and redemption period, see Note 14 – Shareholders’ Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.NOTE 12 Earnings Per Common ShareThe calculation of earnings per common share (EPS) and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 is presented on the following page.

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards and conducts   Bank of America    88a review of its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring  the  fair  values  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  becomeunobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation measures fair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note  21 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Recurring Fair ValueAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, including financial instruments that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.

Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to  decreased price observability, and transfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

Nonrecurring Fair Value
The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019

(1) The weighted average is calculated based upon the fair value of the loans.(2) Represents residential mortgages where the loan has been written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral.
(3) Reflects the measurement of the Corporation’s merchant services equity method investment on which the Corporation recorded an impairment charge in 2019. For more information, see Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value of the merchant services joint venture was measured using a discounted cash flow method in which the two primary drivers of fair value were the customer attrition rate and certain costs to service the customers. The weighted averages are calculated based on variations of the attrition rates and costs to service the customers.NOTE 15 Fair Value OptionThe Corporation elects to account for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information on the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option elections have been made, see Note 22 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following tables provide information about the fair  value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Glossary
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.  Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.  Bank of America    102

Part II. Other Information
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
See Litigation and Regulatory Matters in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 1, for litigation and regulatory disclosure that supplements the disclosure in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Corporation’s  2019  Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K) describes market, credit, geopolitical and business operations risk factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition due to, among other things, “widespread health emergencies or pandemics.” On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. As conditions and circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic evolved subsequent to our 2019 Form 10-K filing, the Corporation disclosed a risk factor in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020 captioned “Coronavirus Disease 2019” to supplement the risk factors described in its 2019 Form 10-K. The following supplements the risk factors described in the Corporation’s 2019 Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020.
Coronavirus Disease 2019
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global economic downturn that has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, the Corporation’s businesses and results of operations, and the duration and future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and/or global economy and the Corporation’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures intended to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures have severely restricted economic activity, reduced economic output and resulted in a deterioration in economic conditions, globally and in the U.S. This has resulted in, among other things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and caused volatility and disruptions in consumer spending and the global financial markets,  including the energy and commodity markets. Although some of these restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas, many of the restrictive measures remain in place or have been reinstated, and in some cases additional restrictive measures are being or may need to be implemented. Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and global economy have been negatively impacted and are likely to be so for an extended period of time, as there remains significant uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery. The negative economic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our financial results during the second quarter in various respects, including an increase in our provision for credit losses and our noninterest expenses. These negative economic conditions are expected to have a continued adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations, which could include, but not be limited to: decreased demand for and use of our products and services; protracted periods of historically

low interest rates; lower fees, including asset management fees; lower sales and trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened volatility; increased noninterest expenses, including operational losses, and increased credit losses due to our customers' and clients' ability to fulfill contractual obligations and deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, which may continue to increase our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs may also continue to be impacted by volatility in the energy and commodity markets. Additionally, our liquidity and/or regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customers’ withdrawal of deposits, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates and customer draws on lines of credit. Continued adverse macroeconomic conditions caused by COVID-19 could also result in potential downgrades to our credit ratings, negative impacts to regulatory capital and liquidity and further capital preservation measures, which could limit the capital we return to shareholders.If we become unable to successfully operate our business from remote locations including, for example, because of an internal or external failure of our information technology infrastructure, we experience increased rates of employee illness or unavailability, or governmental restrictions are placed on our employees or operations, this could also have an adverse effect on our business continuity status and result in disruption to our businesses. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and/or global economy and/or adversely affects our businesses, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K or risks described in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In response to the economic and market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and regulatory authorities, including central banks, have acted and may take further action to provide fiscal and monetary stimuli to support the global economy. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will stimulate the global economy or avert continued recessionary conditions in markets or economies in which we conduct operations. Our participation in and execution of measures taken by governments and regulatory authorities could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions. Such actions may result in judgments, settlements, penalties, and fines adverse to the Corporation.We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks as they evolve globally and in the U.S. The magnitude and duration of the current outbreak of COVID-19, the likelihood of further outbreaks of COVID-19, future actions taken by governmental authorities and/or other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its future direct and indirect effects on the global economy and our businesses, results of operation and financial condition are highly uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause prolonged global or national recessionary economic conditions or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than currently exist, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.

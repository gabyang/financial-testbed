Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its management may make certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.” Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation’s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, liquidity, net interest income, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, deposits, assets, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation’s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation’s potential judgments, orders, settlements, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, including as a result of our participation in and execution of government programs related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states; the possibility that the Corporation's future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, and regulatory and government actions; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties involved in mortgage securitizations; the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs, and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate, inflationary, macroeconomic, banking and regulatory environment on the Corporation’s assets, business, financial condition and results of operations; the impact of adverse developments affecting the U.S. or global banking industry, including bank failures and liquidity concerns, resulting in worsening economic and market volatility, and regulatory responses thereto; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages on economic conditions and our business; potential losses related to the Corporation’s concentration of credit risk; the Corporation’s ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding revenue, net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of changes in or interpretations of income tax laws and regulations; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and potential changes to loss allocations between financial institutions and customers, including for losses incurred from the use of our products and services, including Zelle, that were authorized by the customer but induced by fraud; the impact of failures or disruptions in or breaches of the Corporation’s operational or security systems, data or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns; the risks related to the transition and physical impacts of climate change; our ability to achieve environmental, social and governance goals and commitments or the impact of any changes in the Corporation’s sustainability strategy or commitments generally; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government’s debt limit or changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy; the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics; the impact of natural disasters, extreme weather events, military conflicts (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas, the possible expansion of such conflicts and potential
Bank of America  2geopolitical consequences), terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary.Executive SummaryBusiness OverviewThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, “Bank of America,” “the Corporation,” “we,” “us” and “our” may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our various bank and nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation had $3.2 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 213,000 employees.As of September 30, 2023, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and more than 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in the U.S., and we serve approximately 69 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 3,900 retail financial centers, approximately 15,000 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 46 million active users, including approximately 37 million active mobile users.

We use our website to distribute company   information,   including  as   a  means  of   disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. We routinely post and make accessible financial and other information, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, regarding the Corporation on our website. Investors should monitor our website, including the Investor Relations portion, in addition to our press releases, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, public conference calls and webcasts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information contained on our website as referenced in this paragraph is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Recent DevelopmentsCapital ManagementThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve released final 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test results for Bank of America. Based on the results, our stress capital buffer (SCB) declined to 2.5 percent from 3.4 percent, resulting in a Common equity tier 1 (CET1) minimum requirement of 9.5 percent effective October 1, 2023. On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future U.S. regulatory capital requirements, including the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. In addition, on August 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and eligible long-term debt requirements. For more information, see Capital Management – Regulatory Developments on page 26.On October 18, 2023, the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on December 29, 2023 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2023.For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 22.FDIC Special AssessmentAs previously disclosed, in May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank associated with their closures, and the systemic risk determination announced by the FDIC in March 2023. While the timing and amount of any expense recognition are unknown until the proposed rule is finalized, if the final rule is issued as proposed, the estimated impact of the special assessment on the Corporation would be a noninterest expense of approximately $1.9 billion that would be recognized upon finalization of the rule, which could occur in the fourth quarter of 2023. For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)For definitions, see Key Metrics on page 106. (2)Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 49.Net income was $7.8 billion and $23.4 billion, or $0.90 and $2.72 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $7.1 billion and $20.4 billion, or $0.81 and $2.34 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2022. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Total assets increased $101.7 billion from December 31, 2022 to $3.2 trillion primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents to support balance sheet and liquidity positioning, as well as higher securities financing activity.Total liabilities increased $87.8 billion from December 31, 2022 to $2.9 trillion primarily driven by higher securities financing activity and higher long-term debt and short-term borrowings to support balance sheet and liquidity positioning, partially offset by lower deposits primarily due to an increase in customer spending and debt payments, customers’ movement of balances to higher yielding investment alternatives and seasonal outflows.Shareholders’ equity increased $13.9 billion from December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in net income, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased $614 million to $14.4 billion, and $5.2 billion to $43.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 5 basis points (bps) to 2.11 percent and 25 bps to 2.12 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs, lower deposits and net interest income related to Global Markets activity. For more information on net interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 46.

Noninterest income increased $51 million to $10.8 billion and $1.0 billion to $33.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The following highlights the significant changes.●    Service charges decreased $778 million for the nine-month period primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, as well as lower treasury service charges. ●    Investment and brokerage services increased $168 million for the three-month period primarily driven by higher asset management fees due to higher average market levels and the impact of positive assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by lower brokerage fees. The nine-month period decreased $524 million primarily driven by lower asset management fees and brokerage fees due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels and transactional volumes, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows.●    Investment banking fees decreased $189 million for the nine-month period primarily due to lower debt issuance and advisory fees, partially offset by higher equity issuance fees.●    Market making and similar activities increased $257 million and $2.7 billion primarily driven by improved trading in credit and mortgage products in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities.●    Other income decreased $340 million and $224 million primarily due to higher partnership losses on ESG investments and losses on sales of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities in the nine-month period, partially offset by certain negative valuation adjustments in the prior-year periods. Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses increased $336 million to $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. In addition, provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from commercial net paydowns. For the three-month period in the prior year, the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period in the prior year was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.

Noninterest expense increased $535 million to $15.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher investments in people and technology, higher FDIC expense and costs related to a liquidating business activity, partially offset by lower litigation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest expense increased $2.2 billion to $48.1 billion compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher investments in people and technology and higher FDIC expense, partially offset by lower litigation expense and revenue-related compensation.
Income Tax Expense
Table 4Income Tax ExpenseThree Months Ended September 30Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions)2023202220232022Income before income taxes$8,095 $8,301 $25,218 $23,072 Income tax expense293 1,219 1,847 2,676 Effective tax rate3.6 %14.7 %7.3 %11.6 %
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included discrete benefits of $212 million and $422  million primarily related to certain U.S. state law changesin the three-month period, as well as other discrete benefits primarily related to resolution of U.S. federal and state tax matters in the nine-month period. Absent the ESG tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been 25 percent for both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and 26 percent and 25 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.Bank of America  6Supplemental Financial DataNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.When presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and  investment  models  use  both  return  on  average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:●    Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●    Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.●    Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 8.For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 49.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 106. Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 8.For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 11.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments’ operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Noninterest income decreased $39 million to $2.1 billion, relatively unchanged from the same period a year ago. The provision for credit losses increased $659 million to $1.4 billion primarily driven by credit card loan growth and asset quality.Noninterest expense increased $159 million to $5.3 billion primarily driven by higher FDIC expense.The return on average allocated capital was 27 percent, down  from  30 percent,  due  to an increase in allocated capital and lower net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 11.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income for Consumer Banking decreased $114 million to $8.8 billion due to an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue.

In addition, the prior-year period was impacted by a reserve build related to Russian exposure.Noninterest expense increased $430 million to $8.6 billion, primarily   due   to   continued   investments   in   the  business, including technology and strategic hiring in 2022, and higher FDIC expense, partially offset by expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters in the prior-year period.The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from 16 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by higher allocated capital.Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking The following table and discussion present a summary of the results, which exclude certain investment banking and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) activities in Global Banking.

Business Lending revenue increased $544 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher revenue from ESG investment activities. Business Lending revenue increased $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily driven by higher interest rates, higher revenue from ESG investment activities and the impact of higher average loan balances.Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $34 million to $2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, relatively unchanged from the same period a year ago. Global Transaction Services revenue increased $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower treasury service charges and the impact of lower average deposit balances.Average loans and leases decreased two percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to paydowns and increased two percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to client demand. Average deposits increased two percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to international growth and decreased three percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to declines in domestic balances.Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets.

Total Corporation investment banking fees, which exclude self-led deals and are primarily included within Global Banking and Global Markets, were $1.2 billion and $3.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The three-month period increased two percent compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher equity issuance and advisory fees, partially offset by lower debt issuance fees. The nine-month period decreased five percent compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to lower debt issuance and advisory fees, partially offset by higher equity issuance fees.

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets, including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7.Three-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Markets increased $183 million to $1.2 billion. Net DVA losses were $16 million in the current-year period compared to losses of $14 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $184 million to $1.3 billion. These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.Revenue increased $459 million to $4.9 billion primarily due to higher sales and trading revenue in the current-year period and negative valuation adjustments on leveraged loans in the prior-year period. Sales and trading revenue increased $313 million, and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $315 million. These increases were driven by a strong performance in FICC and Equities.Noninterest expense increased $212 million to $3.2 billion primarily driven by continued investments in the business, including people and technology.Average total assets increased $15.8 billion to $863.7 billion driven by higher levels of inventory, increased secured financing activity and loan growth in FICC, partially offset by lower levels of inventory in Equities.The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent, up from 10 percent, reflecting higher net income partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 11.Nine-Month ComparisonNet income for Global Markets increased $364 million to $4.0 billion. Net DVA losses were $104 million compared to gains of $213 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $605 million to $4.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.Revenue increased $1.2 billion to $15.4 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Sales and trading revenue increased $793 million, and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $1.1 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue in FICC, partially offset by lower revenue in Equities.Noninterest expense increased $686 million to $9.9 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion, partially offset by expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters in the prior-year period.Average total assets increased $12.6 billion to $870.4 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Period-end total assets increased $52.3 billion from December 31, 2022 to $864.8 billion driven by higher levels of inventory, increased secured financing activity and loan growth in FICC, partially offset by lower levels of inventory in Equities.The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent, unchanged from the same period a year ago.

(1)In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders’ equity. Average allocated assets were $955.7 billion and $981.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $1.1 trillion and $1.1 trillion for the same periods in 2022, and period-end allocated assets were $945.7 billion and $1.0 trillion at September 30, 2023 and December 31 2022.All Other primarily consists of asset and liability management (ALM) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Three-Month ComparisonResults for All Other improved $370 million to net income of $89 million from a net loss in the prior-year period, reflecting a higher income tax benefit and lower noninterest expense, mostly offset by lower noninterest income.Noninterest income decreased $881 million primarily due to higher partnership losses for ESG investments.Noninterest expense decreased $123 million primarily driven by higher litigation expense in the prior-year period due to a legacy monoline insurance litigation settlement, partially offset by higher costs related to a liquidating business activity in the current-year period.The income tax benefit increased $1.1 billion, reflecting an increase  in tax preference  benefits primarily due to income tax credits related to ESG investment activity. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets.Nine-Month ComparisonThe net loss in All Other decreased $763 million to $200 million primarily due to a higher income tax benefit and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income.Noninterest income decreased $1.5 billion primarily due to higher partnership losses for ESG investments and losses on sales of AFS debt securities, partially offset by derivative gains related to risk management activities.Noninterest expense decreased $338 million primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion and expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters in the prior-year period.The income tax benefit increased $1.8 billion primarily due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets.Managing RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation’s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits. For more information on the Corporation’s risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. Based on 2023 stress test results, our SCB is 2.5 percent effective October 1, 2023. For more information, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments – Capital Management on page 3.In October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporation’s $25 billion common stock repurchase program (October 2021 Authorization). Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation’s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board’s authorizations, during the third quarter of 2023, we repurchased $1.0 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. In September 2023, the Board modified the October 2021 Authorization, effective October 1, 2023, to include repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans when determining the remaining repurchase authority. As of October 1, 2023, the remaining repurchase authority was approximately $13.6 billion (including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans).The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Regulatory CapitalAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2023, the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios.Minimum Capital RequirementsIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirements were 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach and 9.5 percent under the Advanced approaches. Effective October 1, 2023, our CET1 minimum requirement is 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches.The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase 50 bps on January 1, 2024, which would increase our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to the anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge.The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.Bank of America  22Capital Composition and RatiosTable 8 presents Bank of America Corporation’s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.(3)Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(4)Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.At September 30, 2023, CET1 capital was $194.2 billion, an increase of $14.2 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by dividends and common stock repurchases. Tier 1 capital increased $14.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $12.4 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by a decrease in subordinated debt. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2023, increased $27.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1,632 billion primarily due to higher counterparty exposures in Global Markets and loan growth. Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2023 increased $73.9 billion primarily due to higher cash held at central banks, partially offset by lower debt securities balances. Table 9 shows the capital composition at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Regulatory Developments
On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future U.S. regulatory capital requirements. Under the capital proposal, the Advanced approaches would be replaced with a new standardized approach, referred to as the expanded risk-based approach, which would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. U.S. banking regulators also issued proposed rules to revise the risk-based capital surcharge for G-SIBs, which would be effective two calendar quarters after finalization. On August 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would change the criteria for debt instruments included in the Corporation’s eligible long-term debt and TLAC. Any final rules issued are subject to change from the current proposals. The Corporation is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rules on its regulatory capital, eligible long-term debt and TLAC requirements.Regulatory Capital and Securities RegulationThe Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). On August 13, 2023, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) merged into its immediate parent, BofAS. Prior to that date, MLPCC was a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provided clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. Following the merger, client services previously provided by MLPCC are now being provided by or through BofAS.The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPF&S computes its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a futures commission merchant and is subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2023, BofAS had tentative net capital of $25.1 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $23.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.3 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At September 30, 2023, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $6.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $136 million.Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2023, MLI’s capital resources were $33.7 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $10.8 billion.BofASE, an authorized credit institution with its head office located in France, is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At September 30, 2023, BofASE's capital resources were $9.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.5 billion.In addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at September 30, 2023 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act.Liquidity RiskFunding and Liquidity Risk ManagementOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve Bank of America  26


that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from increased volatility due to the failure of certain financial institutions in the first half of 2023. Our practices have also allowed us to effectively manage market fluctuations from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information on the Corporation’s liquidity risks, see the Liquidity section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.NB Holdings CorporationBank of America Corporation, as the parent company (the Parent), which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered AssetsWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries,  even during stressed market conditions. Our cash

is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.Table 13 presents average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.Our bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $327 billion and $348 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $582 billion and $605 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 116 percent and 120 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.
Liquidity Stress Analysis
We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Stable Funding Ratio
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks.   The   U.S.   NSFR   applies   to   the   Corporation   on  a

consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with the U.S. NSFR.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.88 trillion and $1.93 trillion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions.DepositsOur deposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography and product type across our business segments. At September 30, 2023, 52 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking, 15 percent in GWIM and 26 percent in Global Banking. We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of liquidity. At September 30, 2023, approximately 67 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 30 percent and 34 percent of our deposits were noninterest-bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. Deposits at September 30, 2023 decreased $45.7 billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in customer spending and debt payments, customers’ movement of balances to higher yielding investment alternatives and seasonal outflows.Long-term DebtDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued $54.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $23.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $18.7 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.3 billion of other debt.During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.0 billion consisting of $22.5 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $4.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.9 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2023.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk – Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2)Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Total long-term debt increased $14.4 billion to $290.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt maturities, redemptions, repurchases and valuation adjustments. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued $11.3 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 46.Credit RatingsCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation’s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.The ratings and outlooks from Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ratings and outlooks from Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings (S&P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed  in  the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our asset quality remained relatively healthy. Our net charge-off ratio increased primarily driven by credit card loans, as delinquency trends continue  to slowly increase off of historic lows; however, they remain below the same period in 2019. Nonperforming loans increased modestly compared to December 31, 2022 driven by the commercial real estate office property type, while commercial reservable criticized exposure increased driven by both office as well as other industries that have been impacted by the current environment. Uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical environment and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the U.S. unemployment rate remained relatively stable and home prices have increased slightly in recent months. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs increased $345 million and $853 million to $804 million and $2.2 billion compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to late-stage delinquent credit card loans that were charged off. The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $930 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $8.2 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and loan modifications for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Bank of America  30Table 17 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.

(1)Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, residential mortgage included $180 million and $260 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $85 million and $108 million of loans on which interest was still accruing.(2)Outstandings primarily includes auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $54.0 billion and $51.8 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $46.5 billion and $50.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.(3)For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4)Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $4 million and $7 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.Table 18 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2023. Approximately  51 percent of  the residential  mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 46 percent was in GWIM and the remaining portion was in All Other. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $504 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as paydowns outpaced new originations. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.0 billion and $11.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. Table 19 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(1)Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2)Includes loans that are contractually current that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a modification.Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio of $2.2 billion remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2023, $1.3 billion, or 61 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more increased $81 million.Of the $218.1 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2023, $62.8 billion, or 29 percent, of loans were originated as interest-only. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.5 billion, or six percent, at September 30, 2023. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2023, $66 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $925 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2023, $199 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $63 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of 3 to 10 years. Substantially all of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1)Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Bank of America  32Home Equity At September 30, 2023, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.At September 30, 2023, 83 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, seven percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $10.2 billion and $11.1 billion, or 40 percent and 42 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2023, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.4 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home equity portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $45.0 billion and $42.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The HELOC utilization rate was 35 percent and 38 percent at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.Table 21 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics.

(1)Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2)Includes loans that are contractually current that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a modification. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $31 million to $479 million at September 30, 2023, primarily driven by returns to performing status and paydowns outpacing new additions. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2023, $273 million, or 57 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $118 million, or 25 percent, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.Of the $25.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2023, as shown in Table 21, 11 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered     the    amortization     period    was    $4.3 billion    at September 30, 2023. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2023, $45 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2023, $310 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, 29 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 10 percent and 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $6.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $99.7 billion as purchase volume and card transfers more than offset payments. Net charge-offs increased $345 million to $673 million and $836 million to $1.8 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to late-stage delinquent credit card loans that were charged off. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $592 million, and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $299 million at September 30, 2023. Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $391.3 billion at September 30, 2023 from $370.1 billion at December 31, 2022.Table 23 presents certain state concentrations for the credit card portfolio.

Direct/Indirect ConsumerAt September 30, 2023, 52 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 48 percent was included in GWIM  (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $2.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $104.1 billion driven by declines in securities-based lending stemming from higher paydown activity due to higher interest rates, partially offset by growth in our auto portfolio.

Other ConsumerOther consumer primarily consists of deposit overdraft balances. Net charge-offs increased $29 million to $387 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by higher overdraft losses due to industry-wide increases in check fraud activity.Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Nonperforming consumer loans of $2.8 billion remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2023, $502 million, or 18 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2023, $1.6 billion, or 59 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were current and classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties decreased $9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $112 million.

We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 30, 32 and 35 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 32 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 39.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and loan modifications for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Credit PortfolioOutstanding commercial loans and leases increased $1.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to growth in commercial real estate, primarily in Global Banking, and U.S. small business commercial. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, commercial credit quality deteriorated as nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure increased primarily driven by the commercial real estate office property type; however, the commercial net charge-off ratio of 0.10 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 remained low. With the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial Real Estate section herein, credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since December 31, 2022; however, we are closely monitoring borrower performance in the increased rate environment and emerging trends. Many commercial real estate markets are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. Recent demand for office space has been stagnant, and future demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $325 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $4.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $700.9 billion primarily driven by lower standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees and debt securities and other investments. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent and 56 percent at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.Table 26 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $4.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the commercial real estate office property type and U.S. commercial, partially offset by non-U.S. commercial. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 88 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

U.S. commercial loans decreased $2.2 billion, or one percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by Global Banking. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $2.0 billion, or 19 percent, driven by increases across a broad range of industries.Non-U.S. CommercialAt September 30, 2023, 63 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 36 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM. Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $766 million, or one percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by Global Banking. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $598 million, or 22 percent, due to upgrades and sales of Russian exposure. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41. Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $3.4 billion, or five percent, during  the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $73.2 billion with increases across multiple property types. The commercial real estate portfolio is primarily managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent and 19 percent of commercial real estate at  September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $3.0 billion, or 57 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by office loans. Office loans represented the largest property type concentration at 25 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2023, but only represented approximately two percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and has origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent. Reservable criticized exposure for the office property type was $5.1 billion at September 30, 2023, and approximately $8.7 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. Although we have seen collateral value declines in this property type, the majority of these loans remain adequately secured as of September 30, 2023.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we continued to see low default rates. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Table 30 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

Bank of America  38U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and included $415 million and $1.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. PPP loans decreased $593 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to repayment of the loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 55 percent and 53 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and represented 100 percent and 99 percent of the net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 100 percent for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease of $170 million in accruing past due 90 days or more for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by the repayment of PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA.Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 31 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $987 million to $2.0 billion. At September 30, 2023, 99 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured, and 63 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 89 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Risk Mitigation. Commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $16.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Capital goods, and Retailing.For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $173.5 billion, increased $8.4 billion, primarily driven by exposure to the Capital markets industry group during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $99.8 billion remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 38.Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $93.3 billion, increased $6.0 billion, or seven percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in Trading companies and distributors and Machinery, partially offset by a decrease in Industrial conglomerates. There is uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies due to various macroeconomic challenges including geopolitical, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, and a number of industries may continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

The distributed amounts were $10.6 billion and $10.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.(3)Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.
Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $8.9 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $23 million and $134 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to net losses of $56 million and $66 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 38. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 44.Tables 33 and 34 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured   financing  transactions  or   related  to  client  clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our non-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 35 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2023. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $27.0 billion in 2023 primarily driven by decreases in Germany, Japan and France.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at September 30, 2023 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $54.4 billion, which represents a decrease of $912 million from December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower exposure with financial institutions. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $33.4 billion at September 30, 2023, a decrease of $12.4 billion from December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower deposits with the central bank.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses increased $418 million from December 31, 2022 to $14.6 billion at September 30, 2023, which included a $921 million reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio and a $503 million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The increase in the allowance reflected a reserve build in our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by a reserve release in our commercial portfolio primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. The allowance also includes the impact of the accounting change to remove the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings, which reduced the allowance for credit losses by $243 million on January 1, 2023. For more information on this change in accounting guidance, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 36 presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

The provision for credit losses increased $336 million to $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. In addition, provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from commercial net paydowns. For the three-month period in the prior year, the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $496 million to $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $160 million to $16 million and decreased $278 million to $26 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.Table 37 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

For more information on market risks, see the Market section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Table 38 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 38 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.Table 38 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 using a 99 percent confidence level as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The amounts disclosed in Table 38 and Table 39 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior quarter remained stable.

Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 39 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.

BacktestingThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management – Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2023 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 98 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management – Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book
The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 40 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1)  The Corporation uses SOFR in its baseline forecast as one of the primary alternative reference rates used as a result of the cessation of LIBOR in 2023.Table 41 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to higher and lower rate scenarios was primarily due to changes in deposit product mix. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 22.
Table 41Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve ChangesShort Rate (bps)Long Rate (bps)(Dollars in millions)September 302023December 312022Parallel Shifts+100 bps instantaneous shift+100+100$3,057 $3,829  -100 bps  instantaneous shift-100-100(3,272)(4,591)Flatteners  Short-end instantaneous change+100— 2,949 3,698 Long-end instantaneous change— -100(126)(157)Steepeners  Short-end instantaneous change-100 — (3,169)(4,420)Long-end instantaneous change— +100108 131
The sensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.
Bank of America  46The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, the increase in net interest income would be impacted by any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding as our benefit in those scenarios would be reduced. Conversely, in lower-rate scenarios, any customer activity that results in the replacement of higher yielding deposits or market-based funding with low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce our exposure in those scenarios.For interest rate scenarios larger than 100 bps shifts, it is expected that the interest rate sensitivity will illustrate non-linear behaviors as there are numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated, that could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income, noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months, for example, over 200 bps, customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing will have non-linear impacts to larger short-end rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios, and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts, the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero. In higher short-end rate scenarios, deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate, leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 41. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation’s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair value of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Climate Risk ManagementClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. These changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk. These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. Physical climate events may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or collateral value, or increased operational risk by impacting the Corporation’s facilities, employees, customers or vendors. Climate-related transition changes in policy, technology or the market may amplify credit risk through financial impacts to the Corporation or its customers or counterparties or increase market risk, including through sudden price adjustments. In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices, disclosures and commitments.As climate risk spans all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for each of our seven key types of risk.We publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal). In connection with our Net Zero Goal, we set certain 2030 targets, including reducing emissions associated with our operations and financing activities, related to auto manufacturing, energy and power generation, and for our supply chain, including that a certain proportion of our global suppliers set their own climate targets (2030 Targets). We disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emission and emission intensity metrics for the above referenced sectors in our 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our financed emissions targets.We plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in our 2023 TCFD Report, which we anticipate publishing later in 2023, and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024.Achieving our climate-related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein.For more information on our governance framework and climate risk management process, see the Managing Risk and Climate Risk Management sections in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     For     more information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Other of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on climate-related matters and the Corporation’s climate-related goals and commitments, including our plans to achieve our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporation’s website, including our 2022 TCFD Report and the 2022 Annual Report to shareholders available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. The contents of the Corporation’s website, including the 2022 TCFD Report and 2022 Annual Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2022 TCFD Report and Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Bank of America  48

The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include the Corporation’s interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The nature of the Corporation’s business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results, have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.New Accounting Standard IssuedInvestments – Equity Method and Joint VenturesThe FASB updated its guidance on the accounting for tax credit investments,  which  permits   entities  to  make  an  accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method when certain conditions are met. The new accounting guidance is effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. If adopted, the Corporation does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.New Accounting Standard AdoptedFinancial Instruments – Credit LossesOn January 1, 2023, the Corporation adopted the new accounting and disclosure requirements for expected credit losses (ECL) that removed the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and added disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.Upon adoption of the standard, the Corporation recorded a reduction of $243 million in the allowance for credit losses for the impact of changes in the methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses for non-collateral dependent consumer and commercial TDRs. There was no impact to the valuation of loans previously classified as collateral-dependent TDRs. After adjusting for deferred taxes, the Corporation recorded an increase of $184 million in retained earnings through a cumulative-effect adjustment.The additional disclosures are included in Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses on a prospective basis and include loan modifications where the contractual payment terms of the borrower’s loan agreement were modified through a refinancing or restructuring. Modifications that do not impact the contractual payment terms, such as covenant waivers, insignificant payment deferrals, and any modifications made to loans carried at fair value, loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and leases are not included in the disclosures.The Corporation uses various indicators to identify borrowers in financial difficulty. Consumer loan borrowers that are delinquent and commercial loan borrowers that are rated substandard or worse are the primary criteria used to identify borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty.If a borrower is current at the time of modification, the loan generally remains a performing loan as long as there is demonstrated performance prior to the modification, and payment in full under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, excluding fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period. The allowance for loan and lease losses for modified loans is determined in a manner consistent with the methodology for the respective class and credit rating of the financing receivable as described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Bank of America  54

Offsetting of DerivativesThe Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. For more information, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Securities Financing Agreements, Collateral and Restricted Cash.

Over-the-counter cleared derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a counterparty where the transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Exchange-traded derivatives include listed options transacted on an exchange.(2)Consists of derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where the enforceability of these agreements is uncertain under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries. (3)Amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and, accordingly, do not include excess collateral received/pledged. Financial instruments collateral includes securities collateral received or pledged and cash securities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.
Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates (fair value hedges). The  Corporation  also  uses  these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency- denominated debt (net investment hedges).

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $21.3 billion and $21.4 billion, of which $17.3 billion and $9.2 billion were designated in a portfolio layer hedging relationship. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the cumulative adjustment associated with these hedging relationships was a decrease of $741 million and $451 million.(4)Carrying value represents amortized cost. (5)Represents hedging activities related to certain commodities inventory.
Cash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe following table summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Of the $12.3 billion after-tax net loss ($16.3 billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at September 30, 2023, losses of $4.7 billion after-tax ($6.2 billion pretax) related to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately ten years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant.

For the same periods in 2022 amounts excluded from effectiveness testing and recognized in market making and similar activities were gains of $38 million and losses of $109 million.
Other Risk Management Derivatives
Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging various assets and liabilities. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense recorded on the hedged item.

Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through DerivativesThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had transferred $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $4.3 billion and $4.9 billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the transferred securities was $4.2 billion and $4.7 billion.Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following table, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 17 – Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The following table is not presented on an FTE basis.

Credit DerivativesThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings  of  BBB-  or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. For more information on credit derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.Credit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.

Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralCertain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $104.6 billion and $101.3 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $84.1 billion and $81.2 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. For more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.At September 30, 2023, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $2.9 billion, including $1.5 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant. The following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at September 30, 2023  if  the  rating  agencies  had  downgraded

their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries’ long-term senior debt ratings.

Credit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which measures the carrying value of the Corporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.The following tables present certain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at September 30, 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased to $23.7 billion at September 30, 2023 from $19.3 billion (to 3.83 percent from 3.12 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2022, primarily driven by commercial real estate and U.S. Commercial.Loan Modifications to Borrowers in Financial DifficultyAs part of its credit risk management, the Corporation may modify a loan agreement with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties through a refinancing or restructuring of the borrower’s loan agreement (modification programs).Consumer Real EstateThe following modification programs are offered for consumer real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications represented 0.25 percent and 0.35 percent of outstanding residential mortgage and home equity loans at September 30, 2023.Forbearance and Other Payment Plans: Forbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation suspending the borrower’s payments for a defined period with those payments then due at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan is generally frozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. Alternatively, the Corporation may offer the borrower a payment plan, which allows the borrower to repay past due amounts through payments over a defined period. At September 30, 2023, the amortized cost of residential mortgage loans that were modified through these plans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $270 million and $437 million. The amortized cost of home equity loans that were modified through these plans during the same periods was $39 million and $64 million. The weighted-average duration of residential mortgage loan modifications was approximately 4 months and 8 months for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the same periods, the weighted-average duration for home equity loan modifications was approximately 4 months and 9 months. The total forborne payments for residential mortgage loan modifications was $6 million and $19 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the same periods, the total forborne payments for home equity modifications was $2 million and $7 million. If a borrower is unable to fulfill their obligations under the forbearance plans, they may be offered a trial or permanent modification. Trial Modifications: Trial modification plans generally consist of the Corporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that reduce their contractual payments temporarily over a three-to-four-month trial period. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during the trial period and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become permanent. At September 30, 2023, the amortized cost of residential mortgage loans entering trial modifications during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $33 million and $83 million. The amortized cost of home equity loans entering trial modifications during the same periods was $10 million and $31 million.Permanent Modifications: Permanent modifications include borrowers that have completed a trial modification and have had their contractual payment terms permanently modified, as well as borrowers that proceed directly to a permanent modification without a trial period. In a permanent modification, the borrower’s payment terms are typically modified in more than one manner but generally include a term extension and an interest rate reduction. At times, the permanent modification may also include principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest amounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the terms that give the borrower an improved ability to meet the contractual obligations. At September 30, 2023, the amortized cost of residential mortgage loans that were granted a permanent modification during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $47 million and $128 million. The amortized cost of home equity loans that were granted a permanent modification during the same periods was $9 million and $26 million. The term extensions granted for residential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and can be up to 30 years, but are mostly in the range of 1 to 20 years for both residential mortgage and home equity loans. The weighted-average term extension of permanent modifications for residential mortgage loans was 12.1 years and 9.9 years for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the weighted-average interest rate reduction was 1.31 percent and 1.50 percent. For the same periods, the weighted-average term extension of permanent modifications for home equity loans was 17.2 years and 16.2 years, while the weighted-average interest rate reduction was 2.69 percent and 3.11 percent. Principal forgiveness and payment deferrals were insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.For consumer real estate borrowers in financial difficulty that received a forbearance, trial or permanent modification, there were no commitments to lend additional funds at September 30, 2023. Borrowers with a home equity line of credit that received a forbearance plan could have all or a portion of their lines reinstated in the future if they cure their payment default and meet certain Bank conditions.Chapter 7 Discharges: If a borrower’s consumer real estate obligation is discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, the contractual payment terms of the loan are not modified, although they can no longer be enforced against the individual borrower. The Corporation’s ability to collect amounts due on the loan is limited to enforcement against the property through the foreclosure and sale of the collateral. The Corporation will only pursue foreclosure upon default by the borrower, and otherwise will recover pursuant to the loan terms or at the time of a sale. Residential mortgage and home equity loans that were granted a Chapter 7 discharge were insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs. Defaults of modified residential mortgage and home equity loans since January 1, 2023 were $160 million and $26 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The table below provides aging information as of September 30, 2023 for consumer real estate loans modified since January 1, 2023. Bank of America  74

Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $93 million and $121 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $684 million and $871 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation reclassified $86 million and $151 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and Other ConsumerCredit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6 months to 72 months. As of September 30, 2023, substantially all payment plans provided to customers had a 60-month term. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The September 30, 2023 amortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $196 million and $455 million. The weighted-average interest rate reduction for the  modifications  was 19.40 percent  and  19.02 percent, and principal forgiveness was $16 million and $41 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess the effectiveness of modification programs. Defaults of modified credit card and other consumer loans since January 1, 2023 were insignificant during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the $455 million in modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as of September 30, 2023, $370 million were current, $47 million were 30-89 days past due, and $38 million were greater than 90 days past due. These modifications represented 0.22 percent of outstanding credit card and other consumer loans at September 30, 2023. Commercial LoansModifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower’s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Bank forbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in interest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or other settlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan. The table below provides the ending amortized cost of commercial loans modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation had commitments to lend $871 million to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans were modified during the period.Prior-period Troubled Debt Restructuring DisclosuresPrior to adopting the new accounting standard on loan modifications, the Corporation accounted for modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as TDRs, when the modification resulted in a concession. The following discussion reflects loans that were considered TDRs prior to January 1, 2023. For more information on TDR accounting policies, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 12 percent of new credit card TDRs and 20 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification.Commercial Loans During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the Corporation’s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $745 million and $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation had commitments to lend $358 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $105 million at December 31, 2022.Loans Held-for-saleThe Corporation had LHFS of $7.6 billion and $6.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $10.8 billion and $27.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $11.5 billion and $18.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $634 million and $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Accrued Interest ReceivableAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation reversed $152 million and $409 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan compared to $81 million and $241 million for the same periods in 2022.For the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, interest and fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The September 30, 2023 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above scenarios is estimating a mild recessionary environment in late 2023 and early 2024, which has modestly improved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of December 31, 2022. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be just above five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024 and will remain near this level through the fourth quarter of 2025. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. real gross domestic product is forecasted to grow at 0.5 percent and at 1.6 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2025. The allowance for credit losses increased $418 million from December 31, 2022 to $14.6 billion at September 30, 2023, which included a $921 million reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio and a $503 million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The increase in the allowance reflected a reserve build in the Corporation’s consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by a reserve release in the Corporation’s commercial portfolio primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. The allowance also includes the impact of the accounting change to remove the recognition and measurement guidance on TDRs, which reduced the allowance for credit losses by $243 million on January 1, 2023. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $605 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a decrease of $187 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses increased $336 million to $1.2 billion, and $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was driven by the Corporation’s consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited the Corporation’s commercial portfolio. In addition, provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from commercial net paydowns. For the three-month period in the prior year, the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $4.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by consumer loans, which increased $2.5 billion driven by credit card, partially offset by declines in securities-based lending. Commercial loans increased $2.4 billion driven by broad-based growth.The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the following table.Bank of America  78

certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 – Securities or Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities.The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 or the year ended December 31, 2022 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $950 million and $978 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties. Except as described in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

(1)The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the government-sponsored enterprises or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.(2)A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $17 million and $34 million net of hedges, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $5 million and $35 million for the same periods in 2022, are not included in the table above.(3)The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $93.5 billion and $102.6 billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $55 million and $187 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $71 million and $215 million for the same periods in 2022. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held   for   investment,  were  $1.3 billion   and   $1.6 billion  at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $35 million and $659 million compared to $22 million and $585 million for the same periods in 2022.The following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1)For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies.(2)At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion of seller’s interest.
(3)The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.

Credit Card and Automobile Loan SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of financing.  The loans are sold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on the securitization structure. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various subordinated interests, including an undivided seller’s interest in the credit card receivables and owning certain retained interests. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $15.2 billion and $14.0 billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party investors from the trusts totaled $6.2 billion and $3.0 billion, which are included in long-term debt.Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $1.8 billion and $7.6 billion of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $5.3 billion and $19.5 billion for the same periods in 2022. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $1.1 billion and $2.1 billion compared to $670 million and $2.4 billion, of which substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets for both periods. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at September 30, 2023 was 12.3 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1)Prior period has been revised to include unconsolidated CLOs.
Customer VIEsCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.The Corporation’s involvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $832 million and $914 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Total assets of the consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs were $1.5 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.CDO and CLO VIEsThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated CDO and CLO VIEs, that hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt, ABS or non-investment grade corporate loans, which are funded by multiple tranches of debt instruments and equity securities issued by the VIEs. The VIEs  are managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation held $16.2 billion and $16.3 billion of loans and securities issued by CDO and CLO VIEs at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Corporation’s loss exposure is limited to its loan and debt security holdings and the notional amount of any derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs and CLOs totaled $16.3 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which is insignificant to the total assets of the VIEs.
Bank of America  82Investment VIEsThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $471 million and $854 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $15.4 billion and $12.2 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VIEsThe Corporation holds equity investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, renewable energy and certain other projects. The total assets of these unconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $81.7 billion and $74.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the Corporation’s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which varies based    on    the    type    of    investments.    Tax credits   from environmental, social and governance investments in affordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from renewable energy investments are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year time period. The volume and types of investments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of tax credits recognized each period.The Corporation’s equity investments in affordable housing and other projects totaled $14.9 billion and $14.7 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which included unfunded capital contributions of $6.8 billion and $6.9 billion and are probable to be paid over the next five years. The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits related to affordable housing and other tax credit equity investments of $526 million and $1.6 billion compared to $457 million and $1.3 billion for the same periods in 2022, and reported pretax losses in other income of $379 million and $1.1 billion compared to $350 million and $1.0 billion for the same periods in 2022. The Corporation’s equity investments in renewable energy totaled $13.9 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In addition, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions for renewable energy investments of $6.5 billion and $1.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which are contingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the next two years. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring the project to qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits related to renewable energy equity investments of $1.3 billion and $3.4 billion compared to $527 million and $2.0 billion for the same periods in 2022 and reported pretax losses in other income of $849 million and $2.0 billion compared to $337 million and $1.4 billion for the same periods in 2022. The Corporation may also enter into power purchase agreements with renewable energy tax credit entities. The maximum loss exposure for tax credit VIEs was $28.8 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Bank of America  84NOTE 9 Securities Financing Agreements, Collateral and Restricted CashThe Corporation enters into securities financing agreements which include securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These financing agreements (also referred to as “matched-book transactions”) are to accommodate customers, obtain securities to cover short positions and finance inventory positions. The Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements under the fair value option. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Offsetting of Securities Financing AgreementsThe Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

CollateralThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of this collateral was $852.7 billion and $827.6 billion, of which $820.9 billion and $764.1 billion was sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. For more information on collateral, see Note 10 – Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Restricted CashAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.1 billion and $7.6 billion, predominantly related to cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve requirements.NOTE 10 Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.6 billion and $10.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The carrying value of the Corporation’s credit extension commitments at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, which predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $1.8 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $62 million and $110 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation’s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Bank of America  86

Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $714 million and $575 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.(3)     Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value guarantees.
(4)     Includes business card unused lines of credit. Other CommitmentsAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $788 million and $636 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $452 million and $294 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $128.3 billion and $92.0 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $73.2 billion and $57.8 billion. A significant portion of these commitments will expire within the next 12 months.At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $900 million and $571 million. As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is required to subscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve district bank, which pays cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation paid $5.4 billion for half of its subscribed shares, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve district bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote.Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to  insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $4.3 billion. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $632 million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant ServicesThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was approximately $412 billion, is an estimate of the Corporation’s maximum potential exposure as of September 30, 2023. The Corporation’s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant.

Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesFor more information on representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $621 million and $612 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo ProgramThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $43.6 billion and $59.6 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.Other GuaranteesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Guarantees of Certain Long-term DebtThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities and capital securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Other ContingenciesOn May 11, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank associated with their closures, and the systemic risk determination announced by the FDIC on March 12, 2023. While the timing and amount of any expense recognition are unknown until the proposed rule is finalized, if the final rule is issued as proposed, the estimated impact of the special assessment on the Corporation  would  be a noninterest expense of approximately $1.9 billion that would be recognized upon finalization of the rule, which could occur in the fourth quarter of 2023.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosures supplement the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related expense of $76 million and $442 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $507 million and $1.1 billion for the same periods in  2022.For any matter disclosed in this Note and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation’s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.8 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of September 30, 2023. The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.Information is provided below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Bank of America  88


Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be material to the Corporation’s business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm. Deposit Insurance Assessment On April 10, 2023, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (the Report) for resolving the parties’ pending summary judgment motions. The Report recommends granting the FDIC motion for summary judgment on BANA’s statutory liability for the unpaid assessments, subject to BANA’s statute of limitations defenses to assessments for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013, on which the Report recommends that relevant issues should be resolved at trial. The Report also recommends denying BANA’s counterclaims challenging the adoption of the relevant assessment regulations and granting BANA’s motion for summary judgment on the FDIC’s claims for unjust enrichment and disgorgement. The Report has been submitted to the district court judge for consideration, and the parties have filed objections to the recommendations in the Report.Representment Non-sufficient Fund FeesOn July 11, 2023, it was announced that BANA agreed to settle two separate proceedings with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) related to BANA’s assessing overdraft or insufficient funds fees each time a merchant resubmitted a transaction or check for payment after it had been declined due to insufficient funds (Representment Fees). Without admitting or denying the findings, BANA consented to orders requiring it to pay penalties of $60 million to each of the OCC and CFPB. Under the CFPB Consent Order, among other things, BANA also consented to refund at least $80 million to customers who were assessed Representment Fees between September 1, 2018 to February 18, 2022.Credit Card Sales and Marketing Practices  On July 11, 2023, it was announced that BANA agreed to a settlement with the CFPB related to online advertisements concerning bonuses linked to rewards credit cards and failure to provide those bonuses to certain consumers, and applying for and opening credit cards for consumers without their consent and obtaining credit reports for those consumers. Without admitting or denying the findings, BANA agreed to the entry of a Consent Order requiring payment of a $30 million penalty and certain undertakings concerning consumer redress.

Unemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards
BANA has been named as a defendant in a number of putative class action, mass action, and individual lawsuits in multiple states related to its administration of prepaid debit cards to distribute unemployment and other state benefits. These lawsuits generally assert claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Class action and mass action lawsuits related to the California program, the largest program administered by BANA measured by total benefits and number of participants, have been consolidated into a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. On May 25, 2023, the court dismissed certain of the claims in the MDL while allowing others to proceed, and plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint. BANA filed a partial motion to dismiss certain of the remaining claims in the amended complaint in the MDL, which is currently pending.

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation measures fair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Recurring Fair Value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including financial instruments that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.

The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI. Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to decreased price observability, and transfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

Glossary
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Macro Products – Include currencies, interest rates and commodities products.Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Use of estimates. The preparation of accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The worldwide spread of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new leases standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new leases standard. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the prior leases standard. The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward the historical assessment of whether a contract was or

contains a lease, lease classification and capitalization of initial direct costs. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In accordance with ASU 2016-02, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less.The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU at this time. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Acquisitions
Pending Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. The Company will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities.
The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows:

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets.

On December 13, 2019, the district court entered the final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. A takedown payment of approximately $467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. See Note 14—Legal Matters.

Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, the Company recovered $164 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 12.936 and 13.884, respectively, as of September 30, 2019 to 12.775 and 13.722, respectively, as of June 30, 2020.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the nine months ended June 30, 2020.Level 1 assets. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the nine months ended June 30, 2020.U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $3.1 billion and $6.3 billion of these investment securities as of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, $56 million and $65 million, respectively, of upward adjustments were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. No material downward adjustments were included during the same periods. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, $6 million in impairment was recognized. There was no impairment recognized during the same prior-year comparable periods. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of June 30, 2020 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses:
June 30, 2020(in millions)Initial cost basis$834  Upward adjustments175  Downward adjustments (including impairment)(11) Carrying amount, end of period$998
Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions.If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2020, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at June 30, 2020.
Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities
Gains and losses on the Company’s equity securities are summarized below.

Other Fair Value Disclosures
Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $20.9 billion and $23.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2020. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.7 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2019.

Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2020, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at June 30, 2020 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 7—Leases
The Company entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for real estate. The Company's leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2020 and 2030. Many leases include one or more options to renew. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are generally fixed. At June 30, 2020, the Company had no finance leases.During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, total operating lease cost was $29 million and $84 million, respectively. At June 30, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately 7 years and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.28%.
At June 30, 2020, the present value of future minimum lease payments was as follows:

Commercial Paper Program
Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Company repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper that was issued during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program at June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.
Senior Notes
In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the "2020 Notes", have interest rates of 1.90%, 2.05% and 2.70%, respectively. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $4.0 billion. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally with the Company's other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem the 2020 Notes as a whole or in part at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices.

Note 9—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $97.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $54.4 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2020.
The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, the Company held collateral as follows:

Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal.
Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count.
The following table presents the reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock, effective price per share and recovery of VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments:

Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers.
In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $8.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2020, authorized an additional $9.5 billion share purchase program (the “January 2020 Program”). These authorizations have no expiration date. As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $7.0 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the January 2020 Program have been completed. Dividends. On July 20, 2020, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on September 1, 2020, to all holders of record as of August 14, 2020. The Company declared and paid $663 million and $565 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively and $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks.

Note 11—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

(1)Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 398 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 400 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 43 million and 44 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, and 46 million and 47 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.(2)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.(3)Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes common stock equivalents of 3 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of 1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, and less than 1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4)Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock.

Note 12—Share-based Compensation
The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the nine months ended June 30, 2020:

The Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $102 million and $106 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $306 million and $307 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, net of estimated forfeitures.

Note 13—Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 19% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, and 20% and 19% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates between the three-month periods was primarily due to the change in geographic mix of income.During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $55 million and $230 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $31 million and $70 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The Company’s accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions increased by $18 million and $56 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, and $19 million and $51 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant changes in penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes several U.S. income tax provisions related to, among other things, net operating loss carrybacks, alternative minimum tax credits, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical amendments regarding the income tax depreciation of qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017. The CARES Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results.

On July 22, 2020, UK enacted a legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020. The repeal of the UK tax rate reduction is not expected to significantly increase the Company’s ongoing effective tax rate, however, it will result in a one-time non-cash tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes which are primarily related to intangibles recorded in purchase accounting upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016.

Note 14—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.

In fiscal 2019, the Company paid $600 million from its litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the Damages Class, the defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to $700 million (up to $467 million for Visa), based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered a final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. A takedown payment of approximately $467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

Overview
Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Financial overview. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.Coronavirus. COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office and will continue to have most of our employees work remotely for the rest of 2020. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times.Revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were impacted by declines in volumes and transactions as a result of social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders imposed by countries that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In the quarter, we saw spending improve each month as most countries began to relax these restrictions. Cross-border volume however, continued to be heavily impacted by the decline in travel, which only improved moderately through the quarter. While we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel, lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines, the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on May 4, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Net revenues for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 were $4.8 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively, and decreased 17% and 1%, respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods, driven by the year-over-year changes in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. Exchange rate movements in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point and one percentage point, respectively.Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $1.8 billion, and decreased 5% over the prior-year comparable period, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by our overall cost reduction strategy. Total operating expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 were $5.8 billion, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and increased 4% and 3%, respectively, over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization from our ongoing investments and personnel in support of our strategy for future growth.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. •Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $51 million and $62 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $11 million and $14 million, respectively. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $9 million and $89 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $3 million and $21 million, respectively.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $13 million and $35 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $3 million and $8 million, respectively. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2 million.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $4 million. During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $11 million and related tax benefit of $2 million. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $3 million and related tax benefit of $1 million.Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 6 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $1.1 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $7.0 billion for share repurchase. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020.Senior notes. In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted mid to high single-digit growth for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020(1), respectively, driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial, partially offset by decreased spending beginning in the latter part of March 2020 as countries imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders. Nominal international payments volume declined as a result of decreased spending related to social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and unfavorable movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 was 3% and 7%, respectively.Processed transactions declined 13% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as a result of social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders. Processed transactions grew 1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders.The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

(1)Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(2)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3)Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume.(4)Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5)Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material.(6)Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended June 30,Nine Months Ended June 30,20202019% Change(1)20202019% Change(1)(in millions, except percentages)Visa processed transactions30,676  35,428  (13)%103,391  101,904  1 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues decreased primarily due to the year-over-year changes in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in the latter part of March 2020.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point and one percentage point, respectively.The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues:

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.•Service revenues were flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as COVID-19 spread globally starting in the latter part of March 2020 with a 2% growth in nominal payments volume during the three-month comparable period. Service revenues grew 6% during the nine-month comparable period, in line with nominal payments volume growth of 6%.•Data processing revenues were impacted by a decline in processed transactions of 13% and growth of 1% during the three-month and nine-month comparable periods, respectively, as a result of the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. Data processing revenues benefited from value-added services, acquisition-related revenues and favorable business mix. For the nine-month comparable period, data processing revenues also benefited from select pricing modifications effective in 2019.•International transaction revenues driven by nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 48% and 16% during the three-month and nine-month comparable periods, respectively, as COVID-19 spread globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. For the three-month comparable period, international transaction revenues were also impacted by fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies and favorable business mix. For the nine-month comparable period, international transaction revenues benefited from select pricing modifications effective in 2019.•Other revenues decreased in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower marketing services revenues, lower value-added services revenues tied to travel-related card benefits and non-recurring revenues in the prior year three-month comparable period. For the nine-month comparable period, other revenues increased primarily due to consulting and marketing services related fees and other value-added services.•Client incentives decreased during the three-month comparable period in correlation with the decline in payments volumes and revenues. In the nine-month comparable period, client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in the past 12 months partially offset by the recent decline in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts.

The decrease is offset by an increase in client marketing spend during the nine-month comparable period.•Professional fees decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy.•Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions.•General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to travel restrictions and our overall cost reduction strategy, offset by acquisition related expenses during the nine-months comparable period.•Litigation provision decreased primarily due to lower accruals for uncovered litigation.

Interest expense, net decreased during the nine-month comparable period primarily due to derivative instruments that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt, offset by the issuance of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.•Investment income and other decreased primarily due to lower gains on our equity investments and lower interest income on our cash and investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rates were 19% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, and 20% and 19% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates between the three-month periods was primarily due to the change in geographic mix of income.On July 22, 2020, UK enacted a legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020. The repeal of the UK tax rate reduction is not expected to significantly increase our ongoing effective tax rate, however, it will result in a one-time non-cash tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes which are primarily related to intangibles recorded in purchase accounting upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Data

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was lower than the prior-year comparable period due to higher client incentives and timing of settlement. Partially offset by lower cash paid for taxes and the receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 increased primarily due to fewer purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and the absence of the deferred purchase consideration payment, made in the prior year. Partially offset by higher share repurchase and higher dividends paid. See Note 8—Debt and Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Our ability to access cost-effective capital could be impacted by global credit market conditions. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper that was issued during the three months ended March 31, 2020. We had no obligations outstanding under the program at June 30, 2020.Senior notes. In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2019, except as discussed below.Common stock repurchases. During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 37 million shares of our class A common stock for $6.6 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $7.0 billion for share repurchase. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we declared and paid $2.0 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On July 20, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on September 1, 2020, to all holders of record as of August 14, 2020. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior notes. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020. We intend to fund the acquisition with cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as through the issuance of new indebtedness.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2020 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the unaudited consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has continued to create significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets and certain other instruments held at amortized cost. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the previous applicable guidance. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-13, the Company uses a forward-looking expected credit loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, when credit loss indicators exist and a discounted cash flow approach results in a credit loss, the credit loss will be recorded through an allowance rather
12

Table of ContentsVISA INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)
than through an other-than-temporary impairment. In addition to recording the fair value of its settlement indemnification liability, under the new standard, the Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, which is Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Acquisitions
Terminated Acquisition. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced on January 13, 2020. See Note 13—Legal Matters.

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account:

(1)These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recovered $15 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock.

Level 1 assets. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company held $2.0 billion and $3.8 billion of these available-for-sale investment securities, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years.
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.

Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions.If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2021, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at March 31, 2021.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $21.0 billion and $22.1 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $24.1 billion and $26.6 billion, respectively.Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2021, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at March 31, 2021 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Senior Notes
During the six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes due December 14, 2020.

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $99.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $61.5 billion.

Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count.

Note 10—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity.

Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

Note 12—Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 17% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, and 19% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to $66 million and $147 million of tax benefits recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities.During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $111 million and $117 million, respectively, and the Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $127 million and $176 million, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities, partially offset by increases in gross timing differences as well as various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no significant changes in accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.In September 2020, the Company accepted a settlement offer related to the examination of Canadian tax returns dating back to fiscal 2003, which was subject to approval by the Tax Court of Canada. On January 21, 2021, the Tax Court of Canada approved the settlement agreement related to the examination. The Company’s income tax provision was adjusted to reflect the estimated impact of the settlement in fiscal 2020.The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARP Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 11, 2021. The ARP Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results.

Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of the Company’s litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

U.S. Covered Litigation
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Putative Class Actions

On December 18, 2020, the plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class moved for class certification. On April 28, 2021, a complaint was filed by Hayley Lanning, SBG Designs, LLC and others against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District of Columbia who have taken payment using the Square card acceptance service. The complaint alleges violations of the antitrust laws of those jurisdictions and seeks recovery for plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. To the extent that Plaintiffs’ claims are not released by the Amended Settlement Agreement, Visa believes they are covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan.

Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions
Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs.
VE Territory Covered Litigation
Europe Merchant Litigation
Since July 2013, in excess of 650 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 500 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled.With regard to the claim asserted by one Merchant, trial before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal to determine the lawful amount, if any, the plaintiff may be entitled to recover is set for June 2022. Other plaintiffs, whose claims were stayed pending the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's judgment, are moving their claims forward, mostly before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal.

Other Litigation
Canadian Merchant Litigation

All defendants have settled with the plaintiffs. The appeals by Wal-Mart Canada and/or Home Depot of Canada Inc. of the decisions approving the Visa and Mastercard settlements have been rejected in all five provinces. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. sought leave to appeal the British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan Courts of Appeal decisions to the Supreme Court of Canada, and those applications were denied. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. chose not to appeal the Alberta Court of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Visa and Mastercard settlements are now final.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.Coronavirus. COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and with governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times.Revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were at varying stages of recovery. During the quarter, there was continued year-over-year growth in payments volume and processed transactions. Cross-border volume also continued to improve during the quarter, despite many borders remaining closed. Although we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, new variants of the virus, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development, availability and rollout of effective treatments or vaccines, the timing of border openings, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30 2020, filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2021. Net revenues for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 were $5.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, and decreased 2% and 4% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively. The year-over-year changes are primarily due to cross-border volume, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in March 2020 and higher client incentives, partially offset by growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point.Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $2.1 billion on a GAAP basis and increased 11% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses and lower professional fees. Total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2021 were $4.0 billion on a GAAP basis and increased 1% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses, lower professional fees and lower general and administrative expenses.Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $2.0 billion on a non-GAAP basis and increased 3% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher personnel expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and lower professional fees. Total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2021 were $3.8 billion on a non-GAAP basis and decreased 3% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by lower general and administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and lower professional fees, partially offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Indirect taxes. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, before tax. Net of the related income tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-GAAP net income increased by $112 million. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations.Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Common stock repurchases. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we repurchased 8 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $1.7 billion. As of March 31, 2021, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $10.0 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume growth in the U.S. for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020(1) was 8% for both periods, driven mainly by consumer debit. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 was 2% for both periods. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

(1)Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(2)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3)Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume.(4)Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5)Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material.(6)Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented:

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues decreased during the three and six-month comparable periods primarily due to the year-over-year changes in cross-border volume, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and higher client incentives. The decrease in net revenues was partially offset by growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point.The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues:

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to lower client incentive payments and the timing and impact of COVID-19 on settlement in the prior-year period.Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2021 decreased primarily due to higher purchases of investment securities, partially offset by higher sales and maturities of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the $3.0 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes in December 2020 and the absence of the $1.0 billion commercial paper issued in the prior year, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2020, except as discussed below.Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, we repurchased 17 million shares of our class A common stock for $3.5 billion. As of March 31, 2021, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $10.0 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, we declared and paid $1.4 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 23, 2021, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of May 14, 2021. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior notes. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, we repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of our senior notes due December 14, 2020.

In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.

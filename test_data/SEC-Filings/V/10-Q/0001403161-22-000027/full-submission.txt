NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia, impacting Visa and its clients. The extent and severity of the sanctions impacted the Company’s operations and a reduction in Ruble liquidity impacted the Company’s ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. In March 2022, the Company announced it was suspending its operations in Russia. In addition, the Company deconsolidated its Russian subsidiary, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $35 million, which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance and making other minor improvements. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for purposes of applying

Table of ContentsVISA INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)
the fair value measurement alternative. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Acquisitions
Currencycloud
On December 20, 2021, Visa acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of Visa’s previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). The Company allocated $150 million of the purchase consideration to technology, intangible assets, other net assets acquired and deferred tax liabilities and the remaining $743 million to goodwill.
Tink
On March 10, 2022, Visa acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink AB (“Tink”) for $1.9 billion in cash. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. The acquisition is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking around the world by providing a secure, reliable platform for innovation. Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is subject to revision. If additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, at this time, material changes are not expected.
The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation for Tink:
Purchase Price AllocationWeighted-Average Useful Life (in millions)(in years)Technology$245 4Customer relationships90 6Deferred tax liabilities(71)Other net assets acquired (liabilities assumed)22 Goodwill1,577 Total$1,863 5
Goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition and the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.The Company did not include Tink's financial results in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, March 10, 2022, through March 31, 2022, as the impact is not material to the Company’s financial results.

Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows:

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents related to funds held by the Company, primarily from Currencycloud, on behalf of clients in segregated bank accounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. These amounts are fully offset by corresponding liabilities recorded in accrued liabilities on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets.

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters.

(1)These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity.
The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity:

Level 1 assets and liabilities. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, gross unrealized gains and losses were not material. As of March 31, 2022, $1.5 billion of the Company’s debt securities are due within one year and $2.3 billion is due between one to five years.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.
The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2022 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses:
March 31,2022(in millions)Initial cost basis$908 Adjustments:Upward adjustments806 Downward adjustments (including impairment)(66)Carrying amount, end of period$1,648
Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $156 million, and net unrealized gains of $147 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. For the six months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized gains of $16 million and $176 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are only recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2022, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. As of March 31, 2022, there were no impairment indicators.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $20.7 billion and $20.8 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $21.0 billion and $22.5 billion, respectively.Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. At March 31, 2022, the carrying value of settlement receivable and payable, commercial paper and customer collateral approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Commercial Paper Program
Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2022 was fully repaid in April 2022. Subsequent to March 31, 2022, the Company issued $650 million of commercial paper that was also fully repaid in April 2022.

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.

Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal.
Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the value of the Company’s class B common stock is subject to dilution through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the class B common stock and the series B and C preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

Note 10—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Participating securities include the Company’s series A, B and C preferred stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, B and C preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

Note 12—Income Taxes
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, the effective income tax rates were 20% and 19%, respectively, and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, the effective income tax rates were 17%. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to $66 million and $147 million of tax benefits recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities.During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $65 million and $143 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $17 million and $46 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $145 million and deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims of certain merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company paid $262 million for U.S. covered litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s estimate of its share of the lower end of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation:

VE Territory Covered Litigation
Europe Merchant Litigation
Since July 2013, in excess of 850 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium, Poland and Israel primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 150 Merchants, leaving more than 650 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On November 26, 2021, with respect to certain pending Merchant claims, the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) found that UK and certain other domestic and intra-European Economic Area consumer interchange fees before the introduction of the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) were a restriction of competition, but that the question of whether those fees, along with inter-European Economic Area fees, are a restriction of competition after the introduction of the IFR would need to be resolved at trial. Whether any interchange fees are exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law and the assessment of damages, if any, will also need to be considered at trial. On February 1, 2022, the UK Court of Appeal granted claimants permission to appeal the CAT’s ruling and an appeal hearing is scheduled for July 2022.
Other Litigation

Pulse Network
On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, in part, the district court’s summary judgment decision in Visa's favor, finding that Pulse has standing to pursue certain of its claims, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.
German ATM Litigation
Between December 2021 and March 2022, Visa was served with claims in Germany brought by German savings banks against Visa Europe and Visa Inc. The banks claim that Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals are anti-competitive and they are seeking damages.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation
On December 6, 2021, an amended complaint making similar allegations regarding the setting of foreign exchange rates was filed by several individuals on behalf of a nationwide class, and/or California, Washington, Massachusetts or New Jersey subclasses, of cardholders who made a transaction in a foreign currency. The amended complaint asserts claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well as violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. On January 19, 2022, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows:

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. We announced in March 2022 that we were suspending our operations in Russia. As a result, we are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. Since 2015, domestic transactions have been processed by Russia’s state-owned payments operator, National Payment Card System. With respect to cross-border activities, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside Russia no longer work within Russia, and all transactions on cards issued in Russia no longer work outside the country. Furthermore, we have deconsolidated our Russian subsidiary, as required under U.S. GAAP. For the first half of fiscal 2022 and full year fiscal 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues.With respect to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our priority is ensuring the safety and security of our colleagues and their families who are directly impacted. We are in close contact with those in the region and are providing ongoing support to our colleagues.COVID-19. As the effects of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic continue, our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with our U.S. employees returning to offices in April 2022 in a new hybrid model of flexible work. The ongoing effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2022. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, net revenues increased 25% over both the prior-year comparable periods, primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Net revenues were also positively impacted by our suspension of operations in Russia. See Results of  Operations—Net Revenues below for further discussion. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, exchange rate movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point.For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, GAAP operating expenses increased 11% and 17% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher personnel expense reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth and expenses incurred as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine, and higher marketing expense as we lapped planned delays in spending in the prior year. For the six months ended March 31, 2022, GAAP operating expenses also included higher litigation provision. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately three percentage points and two percentage points, respectively.For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16% over both the prior-year comparable periods, primarily due to higher marketing expense as we lapped planned delays in spending in the prior year, higher personnel expense reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth and higher general and administrative expense related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and higher usage of travel related card benefits. Acquisitions. On December 20, 2021, we acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). On March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink AB (“Tink”) for $1.9 billion in cash. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded an additional accrual of $145 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Common stock repurchases. In December 2021, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased 34 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $7.1 billion. As of March 31, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Litigation provision. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded an additional accrual to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $145 million, and related tax benefit of $32 million determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.•Russia-Ukraine charges. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. •Indirect taxes. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, and related tax benefit of $40 million determined by applying applicable tax rates. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations.Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures:

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues increased during the three and six-month comparable periods primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Net revenues were also positively impacted by our suspension of operations in Russia. See further discussion below.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, exchange rate movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point.The following table presents the components of our net revenues:

In addition, while we normally would have recognized revenues in fiscal third quarter based on fiscal second quarter payments volume, as a result of the suspension of our operations in Russia, this quarter we recognized revenues from our Russian clients based on fiscal second quarter payments volume. •Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 19% and 20% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, partially offset by unfavorable business mix.•International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 42% and 45% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively. International transaction revenues also increased due to select pricing modifications and fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies, partially offset by business mix.•Other revenues increased primarily due to higher consulting and marketing revenues and other value added services. •Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume during the three and six-month comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts.

Cash Flow Data
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:
Six Months EndedMarch 31, 20222021 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$7,721 $6,842 Investing activities(2,332)1,474 Financing activities(8,367)(7,945)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents(305)16 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $(3,283)$387
Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2022 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher client incentive payments.Investing activities. Cash was used in investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to cash provided by investing activities during the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and lower proceeds from sales and maturities, net of purchases of investment securities. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2022 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid, partially offset by the absence of the principal debt payment made in the prior year and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper in the current year. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The carrying amount outstanding at March 31, 2022 of $300 million was fully repaid in April 2022. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2021, except as discussed below.Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $7.1 billion. As of March 31, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we declared and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 22, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior notes. Principal payments on our fixed-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion are due in September 2022 and December 2022, respectively, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Litigation. During December 2021, we deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of March 31, 2022 was $882 million and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisitions. On December 20, 2021, we acquired Currencycloud for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud), and on March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink for $1.9 billion in cash. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Refer to Note 13—Legal Matters to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the Company’s current material legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A.Risk Factors.
There have been no material updates to the “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, other than as set forth below.
Business Risks
Global economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions, including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, may harm our business.
More than half of our net revenues are earned outside the U.S. International cross-border transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or a slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, small business, government, and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics like COVID-19, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, and natural disasters could negatively impact our operations, clients, third-party suppliers, activities in a particular location or globally, and cross-border travel and spend. Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions, tariffs or trade restrictions could limit the expansion of our business in certain regions. In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may impose new expectations or focus investments in ways that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business. As a result of any of these factors, any decline in cross-border travel and spend could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues.Starting in February 2022, the U.S. imposed sanctions against Russia, and may impose additional material financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain Russian organizations and/or individuals, with similar actions either implemented or planned by the European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities. Visa is complying, and will continue to comply, with all applicable global sanctions. We announced in March 2022 that we were suspending our operations in Russia. As a result, we are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the first half of fiscal 2022 and full year fiscal 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues. All transactions initiated with Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside Russia no longer work within Russia, and all transactions on cards issued in Russia no longer work outside the country. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and any further actions by, or in response to such actions by, Russia or its allies could have lasting impact on Ukraine as well as other regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely affect our business; including, but not limited to, accelerating efforts in certain countries to mitigate the risk of potential sanctions on their economies by bolstering their own domestic payment capabilities or implementing other nationalistic laws or policies, as well increased cyber-threats from state sponsored or nation-state actors.A decline in economic, political, market, health and social conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us. Any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue.The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility and severity of new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including the availability of vaccines and treatments; the impact of the reopening of borders and resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, suppliers and business partners; and other factors such as: •third party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers; •increased consumer dispute volumes due to travel or event cancellations and the speed or accuracy in processing refunds; •increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt DDoS related attacks, phishing scams and other disruptive actions, given the shift to online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the ongoing pandemic; •challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring at our data centers, affecting our employees, or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers, acquirers or merchants; •additional regulatory requirements, including, for example, government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs. A number of countries have taken steps to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part of their COVID-19 economic relief measures. It is possible that some or all of these caps may become permanent over time, or that we see governments introduce additional and/or new pricing caps in future economic relief initiatives. In addition, proponents of interchange and/or MDR regulation may try to position government intervention as necessary to support recovery efforts. In an overall soft global economy, such pricing measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business; and•workforce impacts, such as difficulty recruiting, retaining, training, motivating and developing employees due to evolving health and safety protocols; changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models; restrictions on immigration, travel and employee mobility; and the challenges of maintaining our strong corporate culture, which values communication, collaboration and connections, while some employees continue to work from home.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc., together with its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates.Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2024. During the prior quarter, the Company adopted certain optional expedients provided in this ASU in relation to contract modifications and hedge accounting. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account:
Nine Months EndedJune 30,20232022 (in millions)Balance at beginning of period$1,449 $894 Deposits into the U.S. litigation escrow account850 850 Payments to opt-out merchants(1), net of interest earned on escrow funds(672)(261)Balance at end of period$1,627 $1,483
(1)These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity.

(1)VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
(2)Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment.
The following table presents the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets:

Level 1 assets and liabilities. Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

Equity Securities
The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that significant inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.

Other Fair Value Disclosures
Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $20.6 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $22.5 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively.Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Non-financial assets. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2023, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicated that impairment existed as of June 30, 2023.

During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes due December 2022.
Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge
During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company designated €1.8 billion of the Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes (Euro Notes) issued in June 2022 as a hedge against a portion of the Company’s Euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. As of June 30, 2023, all of the €3.0 billion Euro Notes were designated as a net investment hedge.
Credit Facility
In May 2023, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in May 2028. Interest on borrowings will be charged at the applicable reference rate or an alternative base rate as defined in the credit agreement based on the currency and

type of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on the applicable credit rating of the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. As of June 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. This credit facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the credit facility.

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $125.6 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $76.3 billion.The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure:

Note 12—Income Taxes
For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the effective income tax rates were 19% and 18%, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, the effective income tax rates were 11% and 17%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to the following:•During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, a $142 million tax benefit related to prior years due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination; and•During the three months ended June 30, 2022, a $176 million tax benefit related to prior years due to a decrease in the state apportionment ratio as a result of a tax position taken related to a ruling.During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $615 million and $593 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $315 million and $192 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions, including refund claims filed during the quarter. Additionally, the nine month period reflects the change in unrecognized tax benefits related to the reassessment mentioned above.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

Table of ContentsVISA INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)
U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation:

During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded additional accruals of $456 million and $797 million, respectively, and deposited $500 million and $850 million, respectively, into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to the U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows:

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.Disruption in the Banking Sector. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, certain U.S. banks failed, which caused volatility in the global financial markets. These events did not have an impact on our operating results. We continuously monitor and manage balance sheet and operational risks from clients in our portfolio, including their settlement obligations.Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, was approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenues.The continuing effects of the recent liquidity issues at certain financial institutions and the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, net revenues increased 12% over each prior-year comparable period, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point and two percentage points, respectively. See Results of Operations—Net Revenues below for further discussion.For the three months ended June 30, 2023, GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to lower litigation provision, largely offset by higher expense related to personnel. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023, GAAP operating expenses increased 10% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher expense related to personnel. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our operating expense growth by approximately one percentage point.For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% and 12% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to higher expense related to personnel. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses also included higher general and administrative expense.Pending acquisition. In June 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo Holdings (Pismo), a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, for $1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals.Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded additional accruals of $797 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Common stock repurchases. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 39 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.4 billion. As of June 30, 2023, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Litigation provision. During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $456 million and $716 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $101 million and $159 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $797 million and $861 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $177 million and $191 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock convert into shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.•Russia-Ukraine charges. During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures:

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

Cash Flow Data
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:
Nine Months EndedJune 30, 20232022 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$13,828 $12,973 Investing activities(818)(4,395)Financing activities(13,192)(8,656)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents844 (725)Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $662 $(803)
Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher incentive and litigation payments.Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions, lower purchases of investment securities and cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, the principal debt payment upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes and higher dividends paid, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Credit facility extension. In May 2023, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in May 2028. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2022, except as discussed below.Common stock repurchases. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.4 billion. As of June 30, 2023, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we declared and paid $2.8 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On July 25, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior notes. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Pending acquisition. In June 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo for $1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals.Litigation. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we deposited $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of June 30, 2023 was $1.6 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets.

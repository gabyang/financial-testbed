NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Use of estimates. The preparation of accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The worldwide spread of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new leases standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new leases standard. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the prior leases standard. The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward the historical assessment of whether a contract was or contains a lease, lease classification and capitalization of initial direct costs. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In accordance with ASU 2016-02, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the

12

Table of ContentsVISA INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)

present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less.The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU at this time. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Acquisitions
Pending Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. The Company will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

Note 3—Revenues
The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019:

Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities.
The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows:

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets.

On December 13, 2019, the district court entered the final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. A takedown payment of approximately $467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the six months ended March 31, 2020. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. See Note 14—Legal Matters.
The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account:

(1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. See Note 14—Legal Matters. There were no adjustments to the conversion rates during the six months ended March 31, 2020.

The following table sets forth the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred shares recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019:

Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the six months ended March 31, 2020.U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $3.4 billion and $6.3 billion of these investment securities as of March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded no material upward or downward adjustments. During the six months ended March 31, 2020, $9 million of upward adjustments and no material downward adjustments were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2020 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses:
March 31, 2020 (in millions)Initial cost basis$611Upward adjustments119Downward adjustments (including impairment)(5)Carrying amount, end of period$725
Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions.If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2020, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at March 31, 2020.
Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities
Gains and losses on the Company’s equity securities are summarized below.

Other Fair Value Disclosures
Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.9 billion and $18.6 billion,

17

respectively, as of March 31, 2020. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.7 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2019.Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2020, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, commercial paper and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at March 31, 2020 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 7—Leases
The Company entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for real estate. The Company's leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2020 and 2030. Many leases include one or more options to renew. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are generally fixed. At March 31, 2020, the Company had no finance leases.During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, total operating lease cost was $29 million and $55 million, respectively. At March 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately 7 years and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.28%.
At March 31, 2020, the present value of future minimum lease payments was as follows:

Commercial Paper Program
Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. At March 31, 2020, the commercial paper outstanding had remaining maturities of less than 12 months.
Senior Notes
In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the "2020 Notes", have interest rates of 1.90%, 2.05% and 2.70%, respectively. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $4.0 billion. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

Note 9—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.

The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $97.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $56.7 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2020.
The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019, the Company held collateral as follows:

(3) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal.Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. There were no conversion rate adjustments in the six months ended March 31, 2020. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers.In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $8.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2020, authorized an additional $9.5 billion share purchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. As of March 31, 2020, the Company’s January 2020 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.1 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2020 have been completed. Dividends. On April 21, 2020, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on June 2, 2020, to all holders of record as of May 14, 2020. The Company declared and paid $668 million and $569 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks.

Note 11—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

(1) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 398 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 400 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 44 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 47 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.(3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes common stock equivalents of 3 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of 1 million and 2 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, respectively, and 1 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
(4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock.

Note 13—Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 19% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $112 million and $175 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $26 million and $39 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes several U.S. income tax provisions related to, among other things, net operating loss carrybacks, alternative minimum tax credits, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical amendments regarding the income tax depreciation of qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017. The CARES Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results.

Note 14—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

In fiscal 2019, the Company paid $600 million from its litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the Damages Class, the defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to $700 million (up to $467 million for Visa), based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered a final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. A takedown payment of approximately $467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the six months ended March 31, 2020. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

Overview
Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Financial overview. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.Coronavirus. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business is difficult to predict. Our priority has been the safety of our employees, including comprehensive plans to support employee wellness, as well as support for our clients and the communities affected. Although most of our staff are now working remotely, our network infrastructure and application performance continue to perform well and our business operations have comprehensive and coordinated plans in place to address business continuity and recovery needs around the world. We are also in very close and regular contact with clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times.In the month of March 2020, domestic spending, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment and fuel decreased as countries imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders. Declines in cross-border volume as well as processed transactions negatively impacted international transaction and data processing revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Service revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted, as they were recognized on the payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2019.While we have not incurred operational disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business is difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the business of our clients and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2020. We recorded net revenues of $5.9 billion and $11.9 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, respectively, an increase of 7% and 8%, respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods, driven by the year-over-year changes in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March 2020. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point.Total operating expenses were $1.9 billion and $4.0 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, respectively, an increase of 4% and 9% on a GAAP and an increase of 3% and 8% on a non-GAAP basis, respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative, and networking related expenses, as we continue to invest in our business growth.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. •Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded net realized and unrealized losses of $2 million. During the six months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $11 million and related tax expense of $3 million. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $84 million and $80 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $19 million and $18 million, respectively.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $11 million and $22 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. There were no comparable amounts during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $5 million and $7 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $2 million during both the three and six months ended March 31, 2020. There were no comparable amounts during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods.Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Common stock repurchases. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an $8.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2020, authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased 18 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.1 billion. As of March 31, 2020, our January 2020 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.1 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2020 have been completed. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020.Senior notes. In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted high single-digit growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019(1), driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 was 8% and 9%, respectively. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, even with the decrease in processed transactions the latter part of March 2020 as COVID-19 spread throughout the world.The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume.(4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material.(6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented:

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues increased primarily due to the year-over-year changes in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March 2020. The increase in revenues was also partially offset by the increase in client incentives.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point.The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues:

Service revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 as they were recognized on the payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2019.•Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 7% and 9% during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively, select pricing modifications effective in 2019, as well as faster growth of our value-added services and acquisition-related revenue. The growth of our data processing revenues was negatively impacted in the latter part of March 2020 by the decrease in processed transactions as COVID-19 spread throughout the world.•International transaction revenues increased primarily due to select pricing modifications effective in 2019.  International transaction revenues also reflected fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies as well as a 4% decline and 2% growth in nominal cross-border volumes during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively, due to the decrease in cross-border volume through the quarter as COVID-19 spread throughout the world. •Other revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues from value-added services.•Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in the past 12 months and overall growth in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts.

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 was slightly lower than the prior-year comparable period due to higher client incentives and timing of settlement. Partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business and receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 increased primarily due to higher sales of investment securities and fewer purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 was slightly higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher share repurchase and higher dividends paid. Partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper. See Note 8—Debt and Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Our ability to access cost-effective capital could be impacted by global credit market conditions. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The carrying amount outstanding at March 31, 2020 was $1.0 billion, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.55% and remaining maturities of less than 12 months. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Senior notes. In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2019, except as discussed below.Common stock repurchases. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program. During the six months ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased 31 million shares of our class A common stock for $5.5 billion. As of March 31, 2020, our January 2020 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.1 billion for share repurchase. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the six months ended March 31, 2020, we declared and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 21, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 2, 2020, to all holders of record as of May 14, 2020. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior notes. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020. We intend to fund the acquisition with cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as through the issuance of new indebtedness.

ITEM 1.Legal Proceedings.
Refer to Note 14—Legal Matters to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the Company’s current material legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A.Risk Factors.
There have been no material updates to the “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, filed with the SEC on November 14, 2019, other than as set forth below.
Business Risks
The extent to which the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.
The global impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and have significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. Risks related to consumers and businesses changing spending habits, which affect domestic and cross-border activity, are described in our risk factor titled “Global economic, political, market, and social events or conditions may harm our business” under “Risk Factors-Business Risks” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019.The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures have significantly caused rising unemployment in many countries, affected our cross-border and domestic payment activity and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. Governments around the globe have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe economic effects of the virus, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.The outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our clients, customers, suppliers and business partners. COVID-19 impacted both card present and card not present cross-border travel related spending, initially in Asia during February, and then globally and more significantly in March as the outbreak spread to the rest of the world. In addition, as countries imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, domestic spending, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment and fuel, sharply declined in the latter part of March.In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors, including:•merchant, acquirer and issuer failures and credit settlement risk, particularly with respect to the retail, travel and hospitality industries, including airlines, cruise ships, hotels, restaurants and entertainment events;•third party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers;•increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to COVID-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity;•challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring at our data centers, affecting our employees, or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers, acquirers or merchants; and•additional regulatory requirements, including, for example, government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs.These factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition in the longer term will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions broadly resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact, including lower domestic and cross border spending trends, the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recessionary conditions that occur and persist.There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 may have on our business, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, including, but not limited to:•“Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business;” •“We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties;”•“A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business;” and •“Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity.”

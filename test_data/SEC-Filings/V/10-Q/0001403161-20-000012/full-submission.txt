(UNAUDITED)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new leases standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new leases standard. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the prior leases standard. The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward the historical assessment of whether a contract was or contains a lease, lease classification and capitalization of initial direct costs. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In accordance with ASU 2016-02, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less.

Table of ContentsVISA INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU at this time. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 3—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities.
The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows:

Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered the final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. A takedown payment of approximately $467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2019. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account:

Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. See Note 13—Legal Matters. There were no adjustments to the conversion rates during the three months ended December 31, 2019.

The following table sets forth the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred shares recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019:

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the three months ended December 31, 2019.Level 1 assets. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the three months ended December 31, 2019.U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $5.5 billion and $6.3 billion of these investment securities as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.During the three months ended December 31, 2019, $9 million of upward adjustments and no downward adjustments were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no significant impairments. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of December 31, 2019 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses:
December 31, 2019 (in millions)Initial cost basis$595Upward adjustments119Downward adjustments (including impairment)(4)Carrying amount, end of period$710
Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions.If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2019, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at December 31, 2019.
Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities
Gains and losses on the Company’s equity securities are summarized below.

Other Fair Value Disclosures
Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.7 billion and $18.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.7 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2019.

Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at December 31, 2019 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 6—Leases
The Company entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for real estate. The Company's leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2020 and 2030. Many leases include one or more options to renew. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are generally fixed. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no finance leases.During the three months ended December 31, 2019, total operating lease cost was $26 million. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately 7 years and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.31%.
At December 31, 2019, the present value of future minimum lease payments was as follows:

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $97.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $59.2 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2019.
The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, the Company held collateral as follows:

(3) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal.Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. There were no conversion rate adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2019. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

Common stock repurchases. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market for the following periods:

(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers.In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $8.5 billion share purchase program. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s January 2019 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $1.7 billion for share repurchase. In January 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date.Dividends. On January 28, 2020, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on March 3, 2020, to all holders of record as of February 14, 2020. The Company declared and paid $671 million and $572 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks.

Note 10—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

(1) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 398 million and 400 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 44 million and 47 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.(3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 3 million common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million of common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
(4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock.

Note 12—Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were 18% for both the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $63 million, of which $13 million would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.

In fiscal 2019, the Company paid $600 million from its litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the Damages Class, the defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to $700 million (up to $467 million for Visa), based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered a final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. A takedown payment of approximately $467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2019. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

Overview
Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Financial overview. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows:
Three Months EndedDecember 31, 2019 vs 2018 2019 2018 %Change(1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data)Net income, as reported$3,272 $2,977 10%Diluted earnings per share, as reported$1.46 $1.30 12%Non-GAAP net income(2)$3,272 $2,980 10%Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(2)$1.46 $1.30 12%
(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the three months ended December 31, 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. We recorded net revenues of $6.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 10% over the prior-year comparable period, reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2019, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point.Total operating expenses were $2.0 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 14% on a GAAP and an increase of 13% on a non-GAAP basis, respectively, over the prior-year comparable period. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel, professional fees, depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses, as we continue to invest in our business growth.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. •Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $13 million and losses of $4 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $3 million and tax benefit of $1 million, respectively.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $11 million and related tax benefit of $3 million. There were no comparable amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2018 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $2 million. There were no comparable amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2018 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods.Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, we had remaining authorized funds of $1.7 billion for share repurchase. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the next three to six months.Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted high single-digit growth for the three months ended September 30, 2019(1), driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was 10%. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was higher than the prior-year comparable period due to continued growth in our underlying business and receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2019 increased primarily due to fewer purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was slightly higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher dividends paid. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2019, except as discussed below.Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 13 million shares of our class A common stock using $2.4 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2019, we had remaining authorized funds of $1.7 billion for share repurchase. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we declared and paid $0.7 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 28, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on March 3, 2020, to all holders of record as of February 14, 2020. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior Notes. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the next three to six months. We intend to fund the acquisition with cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as through the issuance of new indebtedness.

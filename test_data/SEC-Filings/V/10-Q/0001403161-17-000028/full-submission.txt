Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. ("Visa" or the "Company") is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa U.S.A."), Visa International Service Association ("Visa International"), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe"), Visa Canada Corporation, Inovant LLC and CyberSource Corporation ("CyberSource"), operate one of the world’s largest retail electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018, and expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company expects that the new standard will primarily impact recognition timing for certain fixed incentives and price discounts provided to clients, and the classification of certain client incentives between contra revenues and operating expenses. The Company is still in the process of quantifying the full effect that ASU 2014-09 and all of its related subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including the accounting for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification on the statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance effective October 1, 2016. The adoption had the following impact on the consolidated financial statements:•The Company recorded excess tax benefits of $46 million in our provision for income taxes rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital for the six months ended March 31, 2017 on a prospective basis. Therefore, the prior period presented has not been adjusted.•The Company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share, which did not have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share for the six months ended March 31, 2017.•The Company elected to apply the presentation requirement for cash flows related to excess tax benefits prospectively, and thus, the prior period presented has not been adjusted. This adoption resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing of $46 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The standard will be effective for Visa on October 1, 2018. However, the Company is considering early adoption of the standard on October 1, 2017. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption will impact the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account on the consolidated statements of cash flows. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating a previously required step. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). Currently, all net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are presented in Personnel on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Visa Europe
On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions Visa to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. At the closing of the transaction (the "Closing"), the Company: •paid up-front cash consideration of €12.2 billion ($13.9 billion);•issued preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock of the Company, as described below, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016; and•agreed to pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing.Preferred stock. In connection with the transaction, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created:•series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company’s class A common stock (the “class A equivalent preferred stock”);•series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “U.K.&I preferred stock”); and•series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Europe preferred stock”). The Company issued 2,480,466 shares of U.K.&I preferred stock to Visa Europe’s member financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland entitled to receive preferred stock at the Closing, and 3,156,823 shares of Europe preferred stock to Visa Europe’s other member financial institutions entitled to receive preferred stock at the Closing. Under certain conditions described below, the U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock is convertible into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of U.K.&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory, where, generally, the relevant claims (and resultant liabilities and losses) relate to the period before the Closing. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

Updated purchase price allocation.
Upon the Closing, total purchase consideration of $18.8 billion was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary valuation. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, based on additional information that became available, which impacted certain of the assumptions used, the Company updated the purchase price allocation. The following table summarizes the updated purchase price allocation:
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation Measurement Period Adjustments UpdatedPurchase Price Allocation (in millions)Current assets(1)$4,457 $— $4,457Non-current assets(2)258 (46) 212Current liabilities(3)(2,731) (39) (2,770)Non-current liabilities(2)(2,605) 618 (1,987)Tangible assets and liabilities$(621) $533 $(88)Intangible assets — customer relationships and reacquired rights(2)16,137 (232) 15,905Goodwill(4)3,268 (301) 2,967Fair value of net assets acquired$18,784 $— $18,784
(1) Current assets are largely comprised of cash and cash equivalents and settlement receivable.(2) Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and reacquired rights, which have been valued as a single composite intangible asset as they are inextricably linked. These intangibles are considered indefinite-lived assets as the associated customer relationships have historically not experienced significant attrition, and the reacquired rights are based on the Framework Agreement, which has a perpetual term. Non-current assets and liabilities include deferred tax assets and liabilities that result in net deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 billion based on the updated valuation. In February 2017, the Company completed a legal entity reorganization, resulting in the elimination of most of these deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note 12—Income Taxes. (3) Current liabilities assumed mainly include settlement payable, client incentives liabilities and accrued liabilities.(4) The excess of purchase consideration over net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which represents the value that is expected from increased scale and synergies as a result of the integration of both businesses.

Actual and pro forma impact of acquisition.
The following table presents unaudited supplemental pro forma information for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016, as if the acquisition and related issuance of senior notes had occurred on October 1, 2014. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the Company's consolidated results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisition been completed on October 1, 2014, nor does it purport to project the future results of operations of the combined company or reflect any reorganizations, or cost or other operating synergies that may occur subsequent to the Closing. The actual results of operations of the combined company may differ significantly from the pro forma results presented here due to many factors.

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016 reflects the following material pro forma adjustments:•conversion of Visa Europe's historical results of operations from euro to U.S. dollar, and from International Financial Reporting Standards to U.S. GAAP;•elimination of transactions between Visa and Visa Europe upon consolidation, primarily related to annual license and various other fees paid by Visa Europe to Visa in accordance with the Framework Agreement;•an increase in non-operating expense for the six months ended March 31, 2016 for additional interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from the issuance of the $16.0 billion senior notes;•exclusion of a $255 million gain related to the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option from the six months ended March 31, 2016(1); and•elimination of acquisition-related costs incurred by Visa Europe.(1) For purposes of preparing this pro forma financial information, the fair value of the Visa Europe put option is presumed to have been reduced to zero prior to October 1, 2014. Therefore, the Company did not include any gains associated with a write-down in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option liability in the unaudited pro forma net income for the six months ended March 31, 2016.The pro forma results also reflect the applicable tax impact of the pro forma adjustments. The taxes associated with the adjustments reflect the statutory tax rate in effect during the respective periods.

Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the escrow account was $1.0 billion at March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016. The Company did not make any payments to opt-out merchants from the litigation escrow account during the six months ended March 31, 2017. See Note 13—Legal Matters.The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the covered litigation during the six months ended March 31, 2017. See Note 13—Legal Matters.

Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the U.K.&I. and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in "right to recover for covered losses" within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in "right to recover for covered losses" as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity. During the six months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recovered $120 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock, from 13.952 at September 30, 2016 to 13.388 and 13.948, respectively, at March 31, 2017.The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and "right to recover for covered losses" within equity during the six months ended March 31, 2017. VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 13—Legal Matters.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the six months ended March 31, 2017.Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets.Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the six months ended March 31, 2017.

Table of ContentsVISA INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. There were no significant impairments during the six months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016. These investments totaled $49 million and $46 million at March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2017, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at March 31, 2017.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2017. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.The following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company’s debt in order of maturity:

Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at     fair value on the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2017, but disclosure of their fair values is required: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable, commercial paper, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at March 31, 2017 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Investments
Available-for-sale investment securities. The Company had $78 million in gross unrealized gains and $7 million in gross unrealized losses at March 31, 2017. There were $55 million gross unrealized gains and no gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016. A majority of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities with stated maturities are due within one to two years.

Note 5—Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Goodwill and intangible assets at March 31, 2017 decreased from September 30, 2016 primarily due to measurement period adjustments as the Company updated the purchase price allocation during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 2—Visa Europe. Goodwill and intangible assets also decreased due to foreign currency translation, which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet.In February 2017, the Company acquired a business for a total purchase consideration net of cash received of approximately $302 million, paid primarily with cash on hand. Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Related finite-lived intangible assets recorded totaled $104 million with a weighted-average useful life of eight years. Goodwill of $181 million was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information related to the acquisition has not been presented as the impact is not material to the Company's financial results.

Senior Notes
Interest expense for the senior notes was $125 million and $250 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to $125 million and $149 million for the same periods in 2016. The Company recognized interest expense as non-operating expense and paid $244 million in interest on the senior notes during the six months ended March 31, 2017.
Commercial Paper Program
The Company maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company repaid the $567 million of commercial paper that was issued in December 2016. As of March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding obligations under the program.
Credit Facility Extension
On January 27, 2017, the Company extended the term of the $4.0 billion credit facility that was entered into on January 27, 2016. The credit facility will now expire on January 27, 2022. No other terms were materially changed. A brief description of the material terms and conditions of the credit facility are described in the Company's Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on November 15, 2016.

Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other clients to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The exposure to settlement losses through Visa's settlement indemnification is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company requires certain clients that do not meet its credit standards to post collateral to offset potential loss from their estimated unsettled transactions. The Company’s estimated maximum settlement exposure was $68.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $67.8 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Of these amounts, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion were covered by collateral at March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively.The Company maintained collateral as follows:
March 31, 2017 September 30, 2016 (in millions)Cash equivalents(1)$1,324 $1,295Pledged securities at market value154 170Letters of credit1,477 1,311Guarantees1,369 1,418Total$4,324 $4,194
(1) Cash collateral held by Visa Europe is not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as its clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations.The total available collateral balances presented in the table above were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented.The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated based on a proprietary probability-weighted model and was approximately $3 million and $2 million at March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively. These amounts are reflected in accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.In the last week of March 2017, the Company experienced delays in the processing and settlement of $1.6 billion of volume in Europe. As a result of this delay, this volume was processed and settled in the first few days of April 2017 instead of in March 2017. The settlement receivable and payable amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2017 are elevated because they include this unsettled activity. The balances in these accounts returned to historical levels in early April 2017 following the settlement of this activity.

Note 8—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the U.S. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations. The components of net periodic benefit cost presented below include the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. plans, which represent Visa Europe funded and unfunded pension plans. Disclosures relating to other non-U.S. pension benefit plans are not included as they are immaterial, individually and in aggregate.In October 2015, the Company amended the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and discontinued employer provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants will continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at December 31, 2015. The Visa Europe pension plans had been closed to new entrants prior to the Visa Europe acquisition.

(3) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares that were previously recorded as treasury stock. See Note 12—Income Taxes.Reduction in as-converted shares. During the six months ended March 31, 2017, total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 43 million shares at an average price of $83.64 per share. Of the 43 million shares, 41 million were repurchased in the open market using $3.5 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, the Company recovered $120 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the U.K.&I. and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market.(1)

These amounts include repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2016 for the six months, or December 31, 2016 for the three months, and exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before March 31, 2017.(2) All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (3) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.As of March 31, 2017, the Company's July 2016 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $2.3 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2016 have been completed. In April 2017, the Company's board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program.Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the U.K.&I. and Europe preferred stock. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.The following table presents as-converted U.K.&I. and Europe preferred stock, after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through a conversion rate adjustment, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017.

The cash dividend will be paid on June 6, 2017, to all holders of record of the Company's common and preferred stock as of May 19, 2017. The Company declared and paid $396 million and $795 million in dividends to holders of the Company's common stock during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017.

Note 10—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of each class of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.The following table presents earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.(1)

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 405 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 58 million and 63 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively and 77 million and 78 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock, included within participating securities, was 34 million of as-converted U.K.&I preferred stock and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017.(3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 5 million common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, because their effect would be dilutive. The computation excludes 3 million of common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 1 million of common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.(4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities' income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock.

(1)  Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned.The Company’s non-qualified stock options and RSUs are equity awards with service-only conditions and are accordingly expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company's performance-based shares are equity awards with service, market and performance conditions that are accounted for using the graded-vesting method. The Company recorded share-based compensation cost of $116 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate.

Note 12—Income Taxes
In February 2017, the Company completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities ("legal entity reorganization" or "reorganization") to align the Company's corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. As a result of the reorganization, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe, which were previously recorded as treasury stock.The effective income tax rates were 84% and 56% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively, and 30% and 28% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in the same periods in the prior fiscal year primarily due to:•the aforementioned $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision related to the legal entity reorganization recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2017;•$71 million tax benefit related to Visa Foundation's receipt of Visa Inc. shares mentioned above;•$20 million and $46 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively, as a result of early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies;•the restrictions on U.S. foreign tax credits that can be claimed for Visa Europe's foreign taxes prior to the aforesaid legal entity reorganization; and•the absence of the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.During the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $23 million and $56 million, respectively. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, increased by $69 million and $97 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation:

Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the activity related to U.S. covered litigation:

Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the conversion rates applicable to the U.K.&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders' equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The following table summarizes the activity related to VE territory covered litigation:

U.S. Covered Litigation
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
Putative Class Actions. On November 23, 2016, class plaintiffs that signed the 2012 Settlement Agreement filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit’s decision that vacated the district court’s certification of the merchant class and reversed the approval of the settlement. The Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017.On November 30, 2016, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a “Damages Class” and an “Injunctive Relief Class.” Following the district court’s order, on February 8, 2017, plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class sought leave to file an amended complaint and plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class filed a new class complaint, as described below.The plaintiffs that signed the 2012 Settlement Agreement, acting on behalf of the putative Damages Class, filed a motion requesting leave to file a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. The complaint seeks money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief, and names as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, and certain U.S. financial institutions. The plaintiffs assert that the proposed complaint updates, among other things, claims for damages and accounts for industry developments. Defendants opposed the Damages Class plaintiffs’ motion on March 10, 2017.A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, filed a class action complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys’ fees. That complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against: the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa Rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. The complaint names as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, and certain U.S. financial institutions.Individual Merchant Actions. On February 8, 2017, the same day that the putative Damages Class plaintiffs sought leave to file an amended complaint and the putative Injunctive Relief Class plaintiffs filed a new class action complaint, certain other individual merchants filed motions in existing actions in MDL 1720 requesting leave to amend their complaints. Merchants requesting leave to amend assert, among other things, that their proposed complaints add claims for injunctive relief and update claims for damages. Defendants opposed the various merchants’ motions on March 10, 2017. In addition, on February 8, 2017, certain individual merchants filed a new action in federal court which was subsequently included in MDL 1720.A number of individual merchant actions previously filed have been settled and remain settled, but the settlement agreement with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. automatically terminated upon the exhaustion of appeals concerning the reversal of approval of the 2012 Settlement Agreement. The termination results in a decrease of the “settled” percentage of Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the 2012 Settlement Agreement.  Consequently, as of the filing date, Visa has reached settlement agreements with individual merchants representing approximately 34% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the 2012 Settlement Agreement.Unlike the matters above, all of which were filed in federal court or are pending in MDL 1720, one merchant filed a case on February 17, 2017, in Texas state court. The Texas merchant generally pursues claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. Based on currently available information, the Company believes this matter may be covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan.

Overview
Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We enable global commerce through the transfer of value and information among these participants. Our advanced transaction processing network facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the six months ended March 31, 2017 reflects continued uneven economic growth around the world.Legal entity reorganization. In February 2017, we completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. As a result of the reorganization, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe, which were previously recorded as treasury stock.Financial highlights. Our financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for these periods are as follows:

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)  For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below.We recorded net operating revenues of $4.5 billion and $8.9 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively, an increase of 23% and 24%, respectively, over the prior year comparable periods, reflecting the operating revenues of Visa Europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in approximately negative two-and-a-half and three percentage point impacts to our net operating revenue growth, respectively.Total operating expenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 were $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, an increase of 40% and 28%, respectively, over prior year comparable periods. Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes the non-recurring, non-cash operating expense related to Visa Inc. shares received by the newly-formed Visa Foundation, were $1.5 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, an increase of 24% and 20%, respectively, over prior year comparable periods. The increase in both periods was mainly from the inclusion of Visa Europe's operating expenses following the acquisition.Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Elimination of deferred tax balances. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.•Charitable contribution. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-recurring, non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.•Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded a decrease of $255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income in other non-operating income. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision.•Net unrealized gains on currency forward contracts. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net unrealized gains of $116 million, before tax, in non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $35 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was $81 million.Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

(2) Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 18 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $1.6 billion of cash on hand. As of March 31, 2017, we had remaining authorized funds of $2.3 billion for share repurchase. In April 2017, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted double-digit growth in the U.S., driven mainly by consumer credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted due to the inclusion of nominal payments volume related to Visa Europe for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016(1). Growth on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, was not significantly different from growth on a nominal-dollar basis for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016(1). Growth in processed transactions reflects the inclusion of Visa Europe's processed transactions for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. The following table presents nominal payments volume.(2)

The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.The increase in operating revenues reflects the operating revenues of Visa Europe and continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives.Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in approximately negative two-and-a-half and three percentage point impacts to our net operating revenue growth, respectively.The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. Other revenues for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016 also includes revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.•Service revenues, which include revenues earned by Visa Europe in the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, increased primarily due to 38% and 42% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield.•Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 42% and 43% during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively, which includes data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe in the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield.•International transaction revenues increased primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 129% and 132% during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively, which includes revenues earned by Visa Europe during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. International transaction revenue growth also reflects the resulting impact of Visa Europe revenues on our corresponding yield.•Client incentives increased during the three and six month comparable periods mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed after the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Visa Europe's incentives for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, and overall growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.•Other non-operating income decreased in the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 due to the absence of $116 million of net unrealized gains recognized on currency forward contracts entered into during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. Other non-operating income for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was also lower due to a non-cash reduction of the fair value of the Visa Europe put option of $255 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

Effective Income Tax Rate
In February 2017, to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, we completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities. As a result of the reorganization, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe, which were previously recorded as treasury stock.The effective income tax rates were 84% and 56% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively, and 30% and 28% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in the same periods in the prior fiscal year primarily due to:•the aforementioned $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision related to the legal entity reorganization recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2017;•$71 million tax benefit related to Visa Foundation's receipt of Visa Inc. shares mentioned above;•$20 million and $46 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively, as a result of early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies;•the restrictions on U.S. foreign tax credits that can be claimed for Visa Europe's foreign taxes prior to the aforesaid legal entity reorganization; and•the absence of the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.During the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, our gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $23 million and $56 million, respectively. Our unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, increased by $69 million and $97 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions.Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 and  2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate for these periods in the tables below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the reported periods. See Overview—Adjusted financial results within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the tables below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Data
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was higher than the prior year comparable period, reflecting continued growth in our underlying business, including Visa Europe.Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities increased compared to the prior year comparable period as we invested a portion of the proceeds received from our debt issuance in available-for-sale securities in the prior year. See Note 6—Debt and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Financing activities. Financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017 reflect $3.5 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $795 million of dividend payments. Activity in the prior year comparable period primarily reflected $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, $3.8 billion of cash used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $676 million of dividend payments. See Note 6—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the returns that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries, primarily attributable to undistributed earnings, totaled $8.4 billion at March 31, 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, following our legal entity reorganization, we returned net $1.3 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. This transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and was not subject to U.S. income taxes. If it were necessary to repatriate these undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. income taxes on most of this amount. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these undistributed earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these undistributed earnings outside of the U.S. As such, we have not accrued any U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to the majority of these earnings.Credit Facility Extension. On January 27, 2017, we extended the term of the $4.0 billion credit facility that was entered into on January 27, 2016. The credit facility will now expire on January 27, 2022. No other material terms were changed. See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2016, except as discussed below. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Settlement. In the last week of March 2017, we experienced delays in the processing and settlement of $1.6 billion of volume in Europe. As a result of this delay, this volume was processed and settled in the first few days of April 2017 instead of in March 2017. The settlement receivable and payable amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2017 are elevated because they include this unsettled activity. The balances in these accounts returned to historical levels in early April 2017 following the settlement of this activity.  Senior Notes. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Our first principal payment of $1.8 billion is due on December 14, 2017. However, we intend to refinance this current portion of debt prior to its maturity, market conditions permitting. An interest payment of $244 million was made on December 14, 2016. See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 41 million shares of our class A common stock using $3.5 billion of cash on hand. As of March 31, 2017, the July 2016 program had remaining authorized funds of $2.3 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2016 have been completed. In April 2017, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the six months ended March 31, 2017, we declared and paid $795 million in dividends to holders of our common stock. In April 2017, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.165 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 6, 2017, to all holders of record of our common and preferred stock as of May 19, 2017. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Commercial Paper Program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repaid the $567 million of commercial paper that was issued in December 2016. As of March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding obligations under the program. See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Acquisitions. In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received. The acquisition will help Visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. See Note 5—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There has been no change in the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. that occurred during the fiscal period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

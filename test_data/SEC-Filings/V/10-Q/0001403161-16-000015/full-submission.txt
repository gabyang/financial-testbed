Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Canada Corporation, Inovant LLC and CyberSource Corporation (“CyberSource”), operate one of the world’s most advanced processing networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: pay now with debit, pay ahead with prepaid or pay later with credit products. Visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital, eCommerce and mobile products and services. These services facilitate transactions on Visa's network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally.Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.
In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The standard impacts presentation only. The Company elected to early adopt the standard effective October 1, 2015 and the carrying amount of the Company's debt liability is presented net of issuance costs on the consolidated financial statements. Also see Note 5—Debt.In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, which simplifies the accounting for post-acquisition adjustments by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for the adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2015. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as non-current. The standard impacts presentation only. The Company elected to early adopt the standard on a retrospective basis effective October 1, 2015 and all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Previously, current deferred tax assets had been presented separately and current deferred tax liabilities had been included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts within the consolidated financial statements have been reclassed to conform to current period presentation. The reclass did not affect the Company's total equity, operating revenues, net income, comprehensive income or cash flows as of and for the periods presented. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2—Visa Europe
Acquisition of Visa Europe
On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement (the "Transaction Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company and Visa Europe agreed on the terms and conditions of the Company’s acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to €21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of €11.5 billion and preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock of the Company, as described below, valued at approximately €5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to €4.0 billion (plus up to an additional €0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016.Transaction agreement and option amendment. The Transaction Agreement provides for the acquisition to be effected pursuant to the exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option (the "Amended Put Option"), as described further below. In connection with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, the Company and Visa Europe entered into an amendment (the "Put Option Amendment") to the Visa Europe put option (the "Put") to align certain terms of the Put with the terms of the Transaction Agreement. Under the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the Visa Europe board of directors is required to exercise the Amended Put Option on the closing date of the transaction to effect Visa’s purchase of all of Visa Europe’s share capital. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the completion of the transaction, the Put Option Amendment will also terminate and the Put will revert to its original, unamended form. The Transaction Agreement may be terminated by the Company or Visa Europe, subject to specified exceptions, if the transaction is not consummated by August 2, 2016, or if legal restraints that prohibit the closing have become final and non-appealable. Preferred stock. In connection with the transaction, the board of directors of the Company has authorized the creation of three new series of preferred stock of the Company:  •series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is designed to be economically equivalent to the Company’s class A common stock (the “class A equivalent preferred stock”);•series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “U.K.&I preferred stock”); and•series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Europe preferred stock”). The Transaction Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, at closing, the Company will issue 2,480,500 shares of U.K.&I preferred stock to those of Visa Europe’s member financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland that are entitled to receive preferred stock at closing, and 3,157,000 shares of Europe preferred stock to those of Visa Europe’s other member financial institutions that are entitled to receive preferred stock at closing. Subject to the reduction in conversion rates described below, the U.K.&I preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately €2.2 billion and the Europe preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately €2.8 billion. These approximate values of the UK&I and Europe preferred stock to be issued at closing are based on the average price of the class A common stock of $71.68 per share, and the euro-dollar exchange rate of 1.12750 for the 30 trading days ended October 19, 2015.The UK&I and Europe preferred stock will be convertible into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of U.K.&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. A reduction in the conversion rates of the U.K.&I preferred stock and the Europe preferred stock have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock because it reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. Additionally, the shares of U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock will be subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the existing and potential litigation. The shares of U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities.Upon issuance of the preferred stock at closing, the holders of the U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock will have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock. With respect to those limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the holders of the preferred stock requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. Once issued, all three series of preferred stock will participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock.U.K. loss sharing agreement and litigation management deed. On November 2, 2015, the Company, Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europe’s member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the “U.K. LSA members”) entered into a loss sharing agreement (the “U.K. loss sharing agreement”), pursuant to which each of the U.K. LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each U.K. LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration to be received by such U.K. LSA member. The U.K. LSA members’ obligations under the U.K. loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, the acquisition closing, and additionally upon either (a) losses valued at in excess of the sterling equivalent at closing of €1.0 billion having arisen in claims relating to the U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees (with such losses being recoverable through reductions in the conversion rate of the U.K.&I preferred stock), or (b) the conversion rate of the UK&I preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory, as described above. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities.Prior to closing, the Company and the other parties thereto will enter into a litigation management deed, which will set forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the existing and potential litigation, as described above, relating to the setting and implementation of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the "Europe covered claims"), the allocation of losses resulting from the Europe covered claims, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the Europe covered claims, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with newly established Europe litigation management committees. The Europe litigation management committees, which will be composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, will also be granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the Europe covered claims.

Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. The balance of the escrow account was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015. The Company paid $11 million to opt-out merchants from the litigation escrow account during the three months ended December 31, 2015 to settle their claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters.The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the covered litigation during the three months ended December 31, 2015. See Note 13—Legal Matters.
Potential Visa Europe Liabilities
On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into the Transaction Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. Closing of the acquisition is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates are, or may become, a party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. The Company has obtained certain protection in respect of losses resulting from existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the U.K. loss sharing agreement, and has agreed to certain terms regarding the conduct of such litigation, all of which is conditioned on the closing of the acquisition of Visa Europe by the Company. See Note 2—Visa Europe.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets.Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the three months ended December 31, 2015.Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the three months ended December 31, 2015.Visa Europe put option agreement. On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into the Put Option Amendment to align certain terms of the Put with the terms of the Visa Europe Transaction Agreement. Under the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the Visa Europe board of directors is required to exercise the Amended Put Option on the closing date of the transaction to effect Visa’s purchase of all of Visa Europe’s share capital. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the completion of the transaction, the Put Option Amendment will also terminate and the Put will revert to its original, unamended form. Exercise of the Amended Put Option by the Visa Europe board of directors is mandatory, subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement. As such, for accounting purposes, it is not treated as a written put option and is not required to be recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2015, Visa expected to complete the transaction in accordance with the Transaction Agreement. Therefore, management concluded that it does not expect the Put to revert to its original, unamended form or to be unilaterally exercised by Visa Europe in the future. As a result, the value of the Put was reduced to zero at December 31, 2015.Changes in the fair value of the Put are recorded as non-cash, non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. There were noevents or circumstances that indicated these investments became impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, these investments totaled $47 million and $45 million, respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Due to the completion of an initial public offering by one of the Company's investees during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company reclassified equity securities previously accounted for as a cost method investment, with a carrying value of $4 million, to short-term available-for-sale investment securities. The fair value of this investment at December 31, 2015 was $55 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax unrealized gain of $51 million in other comprehensive income.Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicate impairment at December 31, 2015.

Other Fair Value Disclosures
Long-term debt. In December 2015, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. See Note 5—Debt. These debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. The fair value of these notes, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.The following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company’s debt in order of maturity:
December 31, 2015 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value1.20% Senior Notes due December 2017$1,745 $1,7482.20% Senior Notes due December 20202,986 2,9952.80% Senior Notes due December 20222,237 2,2593.15% Senior Notes due December 20253,962 4,0054.15% Senior Notes due December 20351,485 1,5144.30% Senior Notes due December 20453,462 3,551 $15,877 $16,072
Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at     fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, but require disclosure of their fair values: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at December 31, 2015 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Investments
Available-for-sale investment securities. The Company had $55 million in gross unrealized gains and $14 million in gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2015. The unrealized gains were primarily related to the Company's reclassified equity investment discussed above. There were $7 million gross unrealized gains and no gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2015. A majority of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities with stated maturities are due within one to two years.

Senior Notes
In December 2015, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes (the 2017 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2045 Notes, or collectively, the "Notes") in conjunction with the anticipated acquisition of Visa Europe, in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year, commencing June 14, 2016. The Company recognized interest expense of $24 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 as non-operating expense. The net aggregate proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were $15.9 billion. The discounts and debt issuance costs will be amortized over the respective term of each note using the effective interest method. The indenture governing the Notes contains customary event of default provisions. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of December 31, 2015.Each series of the Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, prior to, with respect to the 2017 Notes, their maturity date, and with respect to the 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2035 Notes and the 2045 Notes, the applicable par call date (as set forth in the table below), at a price equal to the greater of:•100% of the principal amount of such Notes; and•the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest through the maturity or par call date for each of the Notes below at the treasury rate defined under the terms of the Notes, plus the applicable spread for such Notes (as set forth in the table below),plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Note 6—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations, which are not presented below as they are not material. In October 2015, the Company's board of directors approved an amendment of the qualified defined benefit pension plan such that the Company discontinued employer provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of the freeze. As a result, a curtailment gain totaling $8 million was recognized as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost. The Company also recorded a net unrealized actuarial gain of $56 million from the remeasurement of its pension plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 within other comprehensive income.
The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows:

Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other clients to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The exposure to settlement losses through Visa's settlement indemnification is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company requires certain financial institution clients that do not meet its credit standards to post collateral to offset potential loss from their estimated unsettled transactions. The Company’s estimated maximum settlement exposure was $42.5 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, compared to $43.5 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Of these amounts, $2.2 billion were covered by collateral at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.

(1) On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into the Put Option Amendment to align certain terms of the Put with the terms of the Visa Europe Transaction Agreement. Exercise of the Amended Put Option by the Visa Europe board of directors is mandatory, subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement. As such, for accounting purposes, it is not treated as a written put option and is not required to be recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2015, Visa expected to complete the transaction in accordance with the Transaction Agreement. Therefore, management concluded that it does not expect the Put to revert to its original, unamended form or to be unilaterally exercised by Visa Europe in the future. As a result, the value of the Put was reduced to zero at December 31, 2015. See Note 2—Visa Europe and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments.(2) The balance at December 31, 2015 is due to the issuance of long-term debt in conjunction with the anticipated acquisition of Visa Europe. See Note 2—Visa Europe and Note 5—Debt.(3) The increase in accrued income taxes is primarily related to current income taxes accrued in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, but payable in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.(4) Prior period current deferred tax liabilities have been retroactively reclassed to non-current deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of FASB issued ASU 2015-17. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Income Taxes.

Note 9—Stockholders' Equity
Class A common stock split. In January 2015, Visa’s board of directors declared a four-for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder of record at the close of business on February 13, 2015 ("Record Date"), received a dividend of three additional shares on March 18, 2015 for every share held as of the Record Date. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in these unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. As a result of the stock split, all historical per share data and number of shares outstanding presented have been retroactively adjusted.
As-Converted Class A Common Stock.

Note 10—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class and series by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities in the form of unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock units and unvested earned performance-based shares during the period. Net income is allocated to each class and series of common stock based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted number of shares of each class and series of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities in the form of unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock units and unvested earned performance-based shares and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of class B and class C common stock based on the conversion rate in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity.(2) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 405 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 78 million and 88 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.(3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 5 million common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, because their effect would be dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million and 2 million of common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.(4) The outstanding number of shares of class B and C common stock were not impacted by the stock split as these stockholders received an adjustment to their respective conversion ratios instead of stock dividends. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity. Weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding for class B and C common stock are calculated based on the common shares outstanding of each respective class rather than on an as-converted basis.(5) Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and unvested earned performance-based shares.

The effective income tax rates were 26% and 31% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2015 differs from the effective tax rate in the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to:•the non-taxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2015;•foreign tax credit benefits related to prior fiscal years recognized during the quarter ended December 31, 2015; and•the absence of the reversal of previously established state tax reserves in the quarter ended December 31, 2014.During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $20 million, which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as non-current. The standard impacts presentation only. The Company elected to early adopt the standard on a retrospective basis effective October 1, 2015 and all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation.

U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the activity related to U.S. covered litigation.

Interchange Opt-out Litigation
Beginning in May 2013, more than 50 opt-out cases have been filed by hundreds of merchants in various federal district courts, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments, and one of the cases seeks an injunction against the fixed acquirer network fee. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries filed an opt-out complaint that also adds Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. as defendants.Visa reached a settlement agreement with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries, which will terminate if, following all appeals, the MDL class settlement is reversed or vacated with respect to certification of the Rule 23 (b) (2) settlement class or the consideration provided to or release provided by that class. Including this settlement with Wal-Mart, as of the date of filing, Visa has reached settlement agreements with a number of merchants representing approximately 49% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out.

ITEM 2.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” or the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as "believes," "estimates," "expects," "may," "projected," "could," "will," "will continue" and other similar expressions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about our revenue, client incentives, operating margin, tax rate, earnings per share, free cash flow, and the growth of those items.By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made; (ii) are not statements of historical fact or guarantees of future performance; and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from our forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the following:•the impact of laws, regulations and marketplace barriers, including:•increased regulation of fees, transaction routing, payment card practices or other aspects of the payments industry in the United States, including new or revised regulations issued under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act;•increased regulation in jurisdictions outside of the United States;•increased government support of national payments networks outside the United States; and•increased regulation of consumer privacy, data use and security;•developments in litigation and government enforcement, including those affecting interchange reimbursement fees, antitrust and tax; •new lawsuits, investigations or proceedings, or changes to our potential exposure in connection with pending lawsuits, investigations or proceedings;•economic factors, such as:•economic fragility in the Eurozone, the United States and in other advanced and emerging markets;•general economic, political and social conditions in mature and emerging markets globally;•general stock market fluctuations which may impact consumer spending;•material changes in cross-border activity, foreign exchange controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and •material changes in our financial institution clients' performance compared to our estimates;•industry developments, such as competitive pressure, rapid technological developments and disintermediation from our payments network;•system developments, such as:•disruption of our transaction processing systems or the inability to process transactions efficiently;•account data breaches or increased fraudulent or other illegal activities involving Visa-branded cards or payment products; and•failure to maintain systems interoperability with Visa Europe;•the transaction with Visa Europe may not be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all;•Visa Europe's business may not be successfully integrated with our business or we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction;•the costs and risks associated with the transaction with Visa Europe;•matters arising in connection with Visa Europe's or our efforts to comply with and satisfy applicable regulatory approvals and closing conditions relating to the transaction; •the loss of organizational effectiveness or key employees; •the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully or to effectively develop new products and businesses;•natural disasters, terrorist attacks, military or political conflicts, and public health emergencies; and•various other factors, including those more fully described in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015, and our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Overview
Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit, and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide.Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the three months ended December 31, 2015 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth.Visa Europe acquisition. On November 2, 2015, we entered into a Transaction Agreement with Visa Europe, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to €21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of €11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately €5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to €4.0 billion (plus up to an additional €0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. In connection with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, the Company and Visa Europe entered into the Put Option Amendment to align certain terms of the Put with the terms of the Visa Europe Transaction Agreement. Under the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the Visa Europe board of directors is required to exercise the Amended Put Option on the closing date of the transaction to effect Visa's purchase of all of Visa Europe's share capital. The preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, Visa Europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. As part of the acquisition, we also entered into the U.K. loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europe’s members located in the United Kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or Visa Europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom. See Note 2—Visa Europe, Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. The closing of our acquisition of Visa Europe is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in our fiscal third quarter of 2016.Debt issuance. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on these notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14, commencing June 14, 2016. The net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, will be used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the anticipated acquisition of Visa Europe, and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 5—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Financial highlights.
During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded net income of $1.9 billion or diluted class A earnings per share of $0.80, an increase of 24% and 26%, respectively, over the prior year comparable period. Our non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
Three Months EndedDecember 31,   (in millions, except percentages and per share data)2015 2014 %Change(1)Net income, as adjusted$1,686 $1,569 7%Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted(2)$0.69 $0.63 10%
(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) The per share amount for the prior period presented has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded a decrease of $255 million in the fair value of the Put, resulting in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating income that we do not believe is indicative of our operating performance. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the current period presented. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. There was no comparable adjustment recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted net income, effective income tax rate and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles our as-reported net income, effective income tax rate and diluted earnings per share, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2015:

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers.We recorded total operating revenues of $3.6 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 5% over the prior year comparable period driven by continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our total operating revenue growth.Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015 were $1.2 billion, a 2% increase over the prior year comparable period.Reduction in as-converted class A common stock. In October 2015, our board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program, in addition to the existing October 2014 program. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 26 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.0 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion for share repurchase. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted double-digit growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer debit and credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015(1) was 15%. Processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency.

Results of Operations
Operating Revenues
The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services.

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives.Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2015, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about three percentage points in total operating revenue growth.The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues.

Service revenues also benefited from select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.•Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 8% during the three month comparable period. •International transaction revenues increased primarily due to select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, partially offset by a 4% decline in nominal cross-border payments volume growth driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. •Client incentives increased during the three month comparable period mainly due to overall growth in U.S. payments volume, and incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed after the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

Non-operating Income
Other non-operating income in fiscal 2016 primarily reflects a non-cash adjustment to the fair value of the Put of $255 million, which is not subject to tax. The change in value primarily reflects our expectation at December 31, 2015 that we will complete the transaction in accordance with the Transaction Agreement and the Put will not revert to its original, unamended form or be unilaterally exercised by Visa Europe in the future. See Note 2—Visa Europe and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.

Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rates were 26% and 31% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2015 differs from the effective tax rate in the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to:•the non-taxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2015;•foreign tax credit benefits related to prior fiscal years recognized during the quarter ended December 31, 2015; and •the absence of the reversal of previously established state tax reserves in the quarter ended December 31, 2014.Excluding the non-cash, non-taxable $255 million gain recognized as non-operating income upon the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option, the adjusted non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 29% for the three months ended December 31, 2015. We believe the adjusted effective income tax rate provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the current period.During the three months ended December 31, 2015, our gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $20 million, which would favorably impact our effective tax rate if recognized. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions.Our tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was higher than prior year comparable period, reflecting continued growth in our underlying business.Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was higher compared to the prior year comparable period as we invested a portion of the proceeds received from our debt issuance in available-for-sale securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 5—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Financing activities. Financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 reflect net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion received from our debt issuance completed on December 14, 2015, and $2.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. See Note 5—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders' Equity.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the returns that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $7.4 billion at December 31, 2015. If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. income taxes on most of this amount. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these funds been repatriated is not practicably determinable. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued any U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to the majority of these funds.Long-term debt and change in capital structure. In conjunction with the anticipated Visa Europe acquisition, we have evolved our long-term capital structure. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Our first principal payment of $1.8 billion is due on December 14, 2017. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year, commencing June 14, 2016. The Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at our option at any time prior to maturity, at a specified redemption price. In the event that the Visa Europe acquisition is not completed on or prior to February 2, 2017 (which date may be extended), we will be required to redeem all Notes except for the 2035 Notes and the 2045 Notes, at a specified redemption price. The net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of $123 million, will be used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the anticipated acquisition of Visa Europe, and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases.

Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2015, except as discussed below. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Visa Europe acquisition. On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to €21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of €11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately €5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to €4.0 billion (plus up to an additional €0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.We also entered into the Put Option Amendment with Visa Europe to align certain terms of the Put with the terms of the Visa Europe Transaction Agreement. Under the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the Visa Europe board of directors is required to exercise the Amended Put Option on the closing date of the transaction to effect our purchase of all of Visa Europe’s share capital. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the completion of the transaction, the Put Option Amendment will also terminate and the Put will revert to its original, unamended form. We expect to complete the transaction in accordance with the Transaction Agreement, and therefore do not expect the Put to revert to its original, unamended form.Reduction in as-converted class A common stock. In October 2015, our board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program, in addition to the existing October 2014 program. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 26 million shares of our class A common stock using $2.0 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion for share repurchase. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we declared and paid $340 million in dividends. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect our board of directors to declare a quarterly cash dividend at the beginning of February 2016.

Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments
As of December 31, 2015, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $24.8 billion of assets and $10 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, fair value of $7 million was based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

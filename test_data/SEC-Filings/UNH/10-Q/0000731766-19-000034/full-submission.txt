Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Basis of Presentation
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.
The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC (2018 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly.
Use of Estimates
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20 and 2019-01 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative-effect upon adoption approach as of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $3.3 billion of lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities for operating leases on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which, $668 million were classified as current liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, equity and cash flows. The Company has included the disclosures required by ASU 2016-02 below and in Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies.”
The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period that closely matches the lease term.
The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2019 were generated from 4,000 positions out of a total of 32,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary.

3.    Fair Value
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP.
For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2018 10-K.
The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities
Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers.  As of September 30, 2019, the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.2%.The Company has $3.5 billion five-year, $3.5 billion three-year and $3.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2023, December 2021 and December 2019, respectively. The Company additionally has a $2.5 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility with 6 banks that matures in May 2020. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2019, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of September 30, 2019, annual interest rates would have ranged from 2.7% to 2.8%.
Debt Covenants

Legal Matters
Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred.
Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews
The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status.

The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of date of acquisition. Through September 30, 2019, acquired entities’ impact on revenues and net earnings was not material.Unaudited pro forma revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2018 were immaterial for both periods. The pro forma effects of the acquisitions on net earnings were immaterial for both years.

For more information on the Company’s segments see Part I, Item I, “Business” and Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2018 10-K. Total assets at OptumHealth increased to $40.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 compared to $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to goodwill and other intangibles assets from a second quarter 2019 acquisition and the recognition of ROU assets from ASU 2016-02. Total assets at OptumInsight increased to $15.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 compared to $11.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to goodwill and other intangibles assets from a third quarter 2019 acquisition.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
General
UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.

Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Business Trends
Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being, mitigated by our continued efforts to control health care costs. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any impact from the Health Insurance Industry Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions.The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 reflects the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax after a moratorium in 2019.Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care.
Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties
Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K.Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2020 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 2.5%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, including the return of the non-reimbursable Health Insurance Industry Tax, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Health Insurance Industry Tax. There is a one year moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. This moratorium impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations.

2019 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2018 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Consolidated Financial Results
Revenue
The increases in revenue were primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage; pricing trends; and acquisition and organic growth across the Optum business, primarily due to expansion in pharmacy care services and care delivery; partially offset by the moratorium of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019.
Medical Costs and MCR
Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and medical cost trends, partially offset by increased prior year favorable medical cost development. The MCR increased primarily due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium.
Operating Cost Ratio
The operating cost ratio decreased due to the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium and effective operating cost management.

Fee-based commercial group business increased primarily due to an acquisition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by proactive withdrawal from the Iowa market as well as by states adding new carriers to existing programs and managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Commercial and Medicare Advantage, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs. Revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. Earnings from operations were also favorably impacted by operating cost management.
Optum
Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of productivity and overall cost management initiatives in addition to the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows:
OptumHealth
Revenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery, increased care services and organic growth in behavioral health. Increased operating earnings were primarily due to care delivery and care services. OptumHealth served approximately 95 million people as of September 30, 2019 compared to 92 million people as of September 30, 2018.
OptumInsight
Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic and acquisition growth in managed services.
OptumRx
Revenue at OptumRx increased primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by an expected large client transition. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to the factors that increased revenue as well as improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 325 million and 331 million adjusted scripts in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease was due to the large client transition.

2019 Cash Flows Compared to 2018 Cash Flows
Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by higher net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased issuances of commercial paper and decreased net purchases of investments partially offset by increases in cash paid for acquisitions and common stock repurchases.
Financial Condition
As of September 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $50.4 billion included approximately $12.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.5 billion was available for general corporate use), $35.9 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2019. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.
Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity
In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of September 30, 2019, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 41%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 21 million shares at an average price of $245.18 per share. As of September 30, 2019, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 74 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2019, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $4.32 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 was disclosed in our 2018 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations.Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2018 10-K.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; cyber-attacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock.This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.
The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2019.

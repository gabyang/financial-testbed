Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Basis of Presentation
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as filed with the SEC (2017 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly.
Use of Estimates
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to medical costs payable, revenues, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10 and 2018-11 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, an entity can elect to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense the lease over a straight-line basis for the term of the lease. ASU 2016-02 will require new disclosures that depict the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows pertaining to an entity’s leases. Companies may adopt the new standard using a modified retrospective approach or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. When adopted, ASU 2016-02 will not have a material impact on the Company’s balance sheet, results of operations, equity or cash flows.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01). Most notably, the new guidance requires that equity investments, with certain exemptions, be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income as opposed to other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2018, as required, and reclassified $24 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2018 were generated from 20,000 positions out of a total of 29,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2018, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary.

3.    Fair Value
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $13.8 billion and $12.3 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities
Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers.  As of September 30, 2018, the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.1%.The Company has $3.0 billion five-year, $3.0 billion three-year and $4.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2022, December 2020 and December 2018, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2018, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of September 30, 2018, annual interest rates would have ranged from 3.1% to 3.4%.
Debt Covenants
The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2018.

6.    Shareholders' Equity

7.    Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred.

Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews
The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. Those motions were argued in September 2018. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status.

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2017 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2017 10-K and in the discussion below.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
General
UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.
Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2017 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Business Trends
Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any impact from the Health Insurance Industry Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions.The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. In 2019, there will be a one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2019 will reflect the impact of the moratorium.Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and intrinsically lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care.

Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties
Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2017 10-K.Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2019 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 3.4%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing federal tax law, including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The impact of Tax Reform is partially offset by the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018. Health Insurance Industry Tax. After a moratorium in 2017, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018 is $14.3 billion, with our portion being $2.6 billion. The return of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, the medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio and effective tax rate. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will occur in 2019.

2018 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2017 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Consolidated Financial Results
Revenue
The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through risk-based products across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses, pricing trends, including for the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018, and growth across the Optum business, primarily due to expansion in care delivery, pharmacy care services, and outsourcing and advisory services.
Medical Costs and MCR
Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through risk-based products and medical cost trends. The MCR decreased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which more than offset business mix changes and lower favorable reserve development.
Income Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate decreased due to the impact of Tax Reform, which was partially offset by the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax.

The overall increase in people served through risk-based benefit plans in the commercial group market was driven by broad-based growth, primarily in services to small groups. Fee-based commercial group business declined primarily due to attrition at certain large commercial accounts. Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of new state-based awards and growth in established programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. International growth was primarily driven by an acquisition in the first quarter.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served across its risk-based businesses, a higher revenue membership mix, rate increases for underlying medical cost trends and the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax.
Optum
Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of productivity and overall cost management initiatives in addition to the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows:
OptumHealth
Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery and behavioral health, digital consumer engagement and health financial services.
OptumInsight
Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in business process outsourcing and care provider advisory services.
OptumRx
Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, home delivery services, and overall prescription growth. OptumRx fulfilled 331 million and 321 million adjusted scripts, in the third quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

2018 Cash Flows Compared to 2017 Cash Flows
Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by a decrease in unearned revenues due to the September 2017 receipt of our October CMS premium payment of $4.6 billion, offset by higher net earnings, and the year-over-year impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. In October 2018, we paid our portion of the 2018 Health Insurance Industry Tax of $2.6 billion.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net issuances of debt in 2018 compared to net repayments in 2017, an increase in cash paid for acquisitions, increased share repurchases and a decrease in customer funds administered primarily due to the September 2017 receipt of our October CMS payment.
Financial Condition
As of September 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $44 billion included approximately $10 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $0.9 billion was available for general corporate use), $31 billion of debt securities and $2 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2018. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.
Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity
In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of September 30, 2018, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 37%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Credit Ratings.
Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2018 were as follows:
Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a
The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2018, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 98 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Dividends. In June 2018, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $3.60 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2017 10-K.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 was disclosed in our 2017 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations.Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable, revenues, and goodwill and other intangible assets. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2017 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2017 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements include: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application, including increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs or decreases in enrollment resulting from U.S., South American and other jurisdictions’ regulations affecting the health care industry; the outcome of the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in CMS star ratings and other quality scores that impact revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under Medicare, Medicaid and  other government programs, including  the effects of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or debt ceiling constraints; changes in Medicare, including changes in payment methodology, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents; failure to comply with privacy and data security regulations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties of the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our reported shareholders’ equity and results of operations; downgrades in our credit ratings; the performance of our investment portfolio; impairment of the value of our goodwill and intangible assets if estimated future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for our existing businesses or the businesses that we acquire; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or the debt or capital markets to fund our obligations, to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, to maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle or to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock.This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities laws.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.

The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2018 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):

(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets as of September 30, 2018, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction in investment income as the rate cannot fall below zero.(b)As of September 30, 2018, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2018.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

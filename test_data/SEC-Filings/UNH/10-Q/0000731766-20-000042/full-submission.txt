1. Basis of Presentation
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone.Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC (2019 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly.
Use of Estimates
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.
Revenue from Products
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its OptumRx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member’s applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires the use of the current expected credit loss impairment model to develop an estimate of expected credit losses for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses and revises certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, equity and cash flows.Under the current expected credit loss impairment model, the Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company held $2.0 billion of equity securities as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $1.4 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2020 was not material.

The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of June 30, 2020 were generated from approximately 3,000 positions out of a total of 31,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, and the potential economic impacts of COVID-19 on the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2020 was not material.

3. Fair Value
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP.
For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2019 10-K.
The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the six months ended June 30, 2020 or 2019.

4. Medical Costs Payable
The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the six months ended June 30:

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the prior years medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $13.7 billion and $13.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

The Company’s long-term debt obligations also included $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of other financing obligations, of which $328 million and $322 million were classified as current as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities
Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers.  As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.3%.The Company has $4.4 billion five-year, $4.4 billion three-year and $3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature in December 2024, December 2022 and December 2020, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2020, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of June 30, 2020, annual interest rates would have ranged from 0.8% to 1.1%.
Debt Covenants
The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of June 30, 2020.

6. Dividends
In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.
The following table provides details of the Company’s 2020 dividend payments:

7. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred.
Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews
The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S.

governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
General
UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information, advanced technology, and clinical expertise, focused on improving health outcomes, lowering health care costs and creating a better experience for patients, their caregivers and physicians. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.
Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain and difficult to predict. During the quarter, the global health system experienced unprecedented levels of care deferral, which meaningfully impacted all of our businesses. As the pandemic advanced, access to and demand for care was most constrained from mid-March through April, began to recover in May and approached more typical levels by the end of the second quarter. The temporary deferral of care may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in the second half of this year as utilization of health system capacity continues to increase. Health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic from time to time. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows:UnitedHealthcare. We have expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 testing and treatment, telemedicine, and pharmacy benefits; provided customers assistance in the form of co-pay waivers and premium forgiveness; offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer-sponsored offerings; extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship; simplified administrative practices; and accelerated payments to care providers, all with the aim of assisting our customers, providers and members in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Temporary care deferrals significantly impacted UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations for the three-months ended June 30, 2020, contributing to significantly lower medical costs and higher operating earnings than previous periods. The impact of care disruption has been, and will continue to be offset by factors such as COVID-19 related treatment and testing, potential future vaccines and the financial assistance we continue to provide our customers. As health system capacity continues to approach normal levels, consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, is expected to result in increased future medical costs. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, may temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting future revenue in businesses that utilize risk adjustment methodologies. Depending on the future pacing and intensity of the virus, as well as the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, the ultimate impact is uncertain.Optum. The temporary deferral of care also meaningfully impacted the Optum businesses for the three-months ended June 30, 2020. For example, our fee-for-service care delivery business, such as traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers, was negatively impacted, while our risk-based care delivery business performance reflected lower demand for care. Our OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses were negatively impacted by the lower level of care encounters which took place, contributing to lower managed services and prescription volume. As the health system continues to return nearer to normal seasonally adjusted levels of care, we have seen business activity approach more normal levels. COVID-19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of COVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services that Optum provides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is uncertain.

Business Trends
Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population; and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19 and the Health Insurance Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2021 will reflect the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax.Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods. As a result of higher than expected care deferrals, favorable reserve development of $1.4 billion occurred in the second quarter.
Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties
Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this report.Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2021 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 1.7%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Tax for 2020, which is primarily borne by customers, is $15.5 billion, with our portion being approximately $3.0 billion. The return of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. The ACA Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021.

2020 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2019 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Consolidated Financial Results
Revenue
The increases in revenue were primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage; pricing trends; and acquisition and organic growth across the Optum business, primarily due to expansion in pharmacy care services and care delivery. The increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our Medicaid, commercial and Global benefits businesses; decreases in our fee-for-service care delivery and other volume-based businesses, primarily as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and health system; and certain customer assistance programs.
Medical Costs and MCR
Medical costs decreased as a result of the temporary deferral of care due to COVID-19 and decreased people served in Medicaid, commercial and Global, partially offset by growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and medical cost trends. The MCR decreased primarily due to the temporary deferral of care and the revenue effects of the return of the Health Insurance Tax.
Operating Cost Ratio
The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Tax and the Company’s COVID-19 response efforts.
Income Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax.

Reportable Segments
See Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information:

Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and expected attrition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by the proactive withdrawal from a market as well as by states managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans and states easing redetermination requirements. The decrease in people served by UnitedHealthcare Global is a result of our continued affordability efforts, underwriting discipline and increased unemployment.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage, a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial, Medicaid and Global businesses and foreign currency impacts. Earnings from operations increased due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19 on the health system and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by the return of the Health Insurance Tax, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs and customer assistance programs.
Optum
Total revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth. Earnings from operations increased due to growth at OptumHealth and OptumInsight, partially offset by decreased earnings from operations at OptumRx. The results by segment were as follows:
OptumHealth
Revenue and earnings at OptumHealth increased primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth in risk-based care delivery, partially offset by reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements as a result of COVID-19. Earnings from operations also increased at  our risk-based business due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19. OptumHealth served approximately 97 million people as of June 30, 2020 compared to 95 million people as of June 30, 2019.
OptumInsight
Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in managed services, partially offset by decreased activity levels in volume-based services due to the impact of COVID-19 on payer and care provider clients.

Table of Contents
OptumRx
Revenue at OptumRx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy co-payments. See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further detail. Revenue at OptumRx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in specialty pharmacy and new client wins, partially offset by an expected large client transition and lower script volumes driven by COVID-19 related care deferral, primarily related to first fill script volumes. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to the impact of lower script volumes, partially offset by improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 316 million and 343 million adjusted scripts in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was due to the expected large client transition and lower script volumes due to the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by organic growth.

2020 Cash Flows Compared to 2019 Cash Flows
Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by increased net earnings as a result of the temporary deferral of care experienced at our benefits businesses related to COVID-19 and the timing of federal income tax payments, which will be paid in the third quarter. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included decreased common stock repurchases and decreased net purchases of investments.
Financial Condition
As of June 30, 2020, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $60.3 billion included approximately $22.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $4.2 billion was available for general corporate use), $36.0 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.5 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2020. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.

Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity
In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of June 30, 2020, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 39%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2020 were as follows:
Moody’sS&P GlobalFitchA.M. Best RatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookSenior unsecured debtA3StableA+StableAStableA-PositiveCommercial paperP-2n/aA-1n/aF1n/aAMB-1n/a
The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 and related governmental market stabilization programs. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 6 million shares at an average price of $271.32 per share. As of June 30, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 66 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report.
For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 was disclosed in our 2019 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations.Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2019 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyber-attacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of June 30, 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):
June 30, 2020Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a)InterestExpense PerAnnum (a)Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b)Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities2 %$504  $200  $(2,567) $(8,573) 1252  100  (1,271) (4,715) (1)(80) (16) 623  4,676  (2)(80) (16) 657  6,214

(a)  Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rate cannot fall below zero. (b)  As of June 30, 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 1% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction.


ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2020.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The risks described in our 2019 10-K and 2020 First Quarter 10-Q, are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no other material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2019 10-K and 2020 First Quarter 10-Q.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the second quarter 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of June 30, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 66 million shares of our common stock.
